Skeletal remains found near an Arizona campground are believed to be those of a missing 2-year-old, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. Sylar Newton was reported  away from Camp Tres Amigos.NEWTON, Ariz. — A missing 2-year-old boy was found Tuesday with skeletal remains near a campground outside the Yavapai County town of Camp Tres Amigos, according to the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office.Aircraft spotters spotted bones in Arizona that match the skeletal remains of a missing 2-year-old boy a day after searchers reported that an unknown person or persons brought them to the scene, according to the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office.“He had been missing for a couple days. He was located with his skeletal remains near our campground today,” Sgt. Joe Wershoven of the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “We are grateful for the discovery and for the efforts of the pilots flying over the area who followed our footprints and managed to find the subject.”Aircraft spotter Brian Naylor told The Arizona Republic in a story published Tuesday evening about the discovery that the bones were human in nature but believed they may be linked to the disappearance of Sylar Newton from a home near Camp Tres Amigos over the weekend.Naylor told Fox 30 in Flagstaff that Sylar’s body may have been buried near the home. An examination of the area by members of the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office Crime Lab later Tuesday found “no skeletal material,” according to a Sheriff’s Office statement.Sylar was a 2-year-old boy who went missing from home in Prescott over the weekend.The Sheriff’s Office, assisted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Prescott Police Department, is still investigating the case.Yavapai County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Matt Haney said Newton and his family are aware of the finding.“We are heartbroken that he has been taken from us,” Newton’s mother, Dina Newton, wrote on Facebook shortly after the discovery. “We pray that we can be reunited soon.”	0
An explosion on an oil tanker off the Japanese coast set off a huge fire Thursday and left the vessel's captain missing. Ships and aircraft battled Â until late Thursday and early Friday for a location where the captain and other crew members could be found. A second explosion then rocked a nearby ship. The captain's sister said a man who saw his last known activity at 5 p.m. Thursday, when the tanker exploded, turned the ship's engine over to put it out of commission. It was unclear what caused the second explosion. The ship's crew then abandoned the ship in the early going of Friday morning. Authorities did not rule out the possibility of another explosion.Japan's coast guard, on its second visit to a tanker in two days, said it found nothing amiss with the ship and no need to panic."We are quite relieved," said marine safety commissioner Shinji Kawano. "The ship's engines are in good order."About 12 hours after the first explosion Thursday, the tanker was anchored at a harbor in Izumisano, a port of Niigata Prefecture not far from the tanker's home port in Tsuruoka City, Niigata Prefecture. The ship was leaking fuel and spewed black smoke.The ship's crew were waiting for instructions on what to do, Kawano told reporters. He said there was nothing to panic about, only a "matter of time" before the ship could be refloated safely."If we had to wait for more than two hours, the ship would have sunk," he said, adding that the tanker had a chance of sinking within 30 minutes.A fire started by the explosion was small but intense, Kawano said.Japanese television pictures showed dozens of fire trucks, water tankers and rescuers working to control the blaze. About 1,500 tons of fuel were being drained, he said."If the crew members were on shore, they would evacuate," Kawano said. "If the crew members were on the tanker, we are still considering the possibility of a fire."He also said all available help would be used to deal with the blaze.The ship's commander and first mate were missing, and it was unclear whether the men were injured or had been rescued, Kawano said.The crew was based at a port in Niigata Prefecture and was going about 120 n	0
Operators of a South African gold mine negotiated with about 15,000 striking workers Monday after they walked off the job the night before, a company official said. "At this stage, the reason for the strike remains unclear, but we  have to negotiate for the good of the business," said John Langa, a manager for DeBeers South Africa, which operates the mine. In a statement, Langa said the mine operators were negotiating with the strike leaders and that the workers were not threatening to strike again. He said the workers are seeking an assurance that the strike would not spread to other sections of the mine."This gives us a good opportunity to improve our operations and to move the employees back to the production line." DeBeers has not said whether it is considering reopening the mine but it has said it is looking into the concerns expressed by employees about its business model. "We are currently meeting with the relevant parties which will take time to finalize the situation," said DeBeers' South Africa general manager, Gary Tshale. "The union has given very clear notice that this is going to be an indefinite strike. And at this stage, it is not clear why the strike has been called."We are also not ignoring the issues raised by the employees. DeBeers is open to the workers' concerns and is working to resolve them." Langa said the workers have asked for an apology from DeBeers, an end to violence, a guarantee that no more layoffs will occur, better access to social security and medical benefits and a reduction in management involvement at the mine. "At this stage, the main problem is they have not addressed the issues that the workers are raising with DeBeers," Langa said, adding that the workers were seeking recognition of their union by the company. He said they also wanted a meeting with DeBeers' top brass to discuss their concerns."It is a problem that it is not happening, but they haven't addressed it." He said that he did not believe workers would strike again, and that the mine had been operating as usual because he is certain the unions were still interested in meeting with DeBeers. "I have the feeling that the union wants to get back in business with DeBeers because the last round is over, but the union should have negotiated a contract which satisfies the workers." DeBeers South Africa spokesman Mike Langa told the Post there was no	0
A federal judge on Thursday threw out an author's claims that Jessica Seinfeld, the comedian's wife, plagiarized from her cookbook, but the judge left open claims of defamation against Jerry Seinfeld himself. Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld attend an event in New York City in June. "This is a complete victory for Jessica Seinfeld," said Orin Snyder, Seinfeld's lawyer. Snyder said U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed all claims brought against Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook, "Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food." In the lawsuit, filed in 2007, author Missy Chase Lapine accused Jessica Seinfeld of taking ideas from Lapine's cookbook "The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals." Lapine's cookbook was published in April 2007, six months before Seinfeld's book. "The court categorically rejected the claim that 'Deceptively Delicious' infringed the copyright and trademark of the plaintiff's book," Snyder said. "The federal judge ruled that 'no reasonable fact finder could conclude' that copying occurred here given that the works are 'very different' and that Jessica's book 'has a completely different feel.' " But Lapine's lawyer, Howard B. Miller, said his client may appeal the dismissal of her copyright and trademark claims, and will refile in state court claims against Jerry Seinfeld. Lapine's defamation claims against the comedian refer to a comment he made on the "Late Show with David Letterman" in 2007, when he compared the fact that Lapine uses three names to the fact that assassins sometimes use three names, as was the case with Lee Harvey Oswald. "The claims against Jerry Seinfeld for defamation are still fully alive," Miller said. "He just says he is joking; we don't think calling someone an assassin and a wacko is a joke." "I'm up against a very powerful opponent," Lapine said in a telephone interview from her home in Westchester County, New York. "Justice is not always served." Lapine, a 45-year-old mother of two, said she has gone on to publish two other books, all in the "Sneaky Chef" series.	1
and most debated -- quotes in all of history, he actually might have said it exactly the way he meant to, not the way people heard it. After Armstrong lowered his left foot from the landing craft to the surface of the moon, people watching around the world heard him call it "one small step for man." Both he and NASA initially insisted that he said "one small step for a man," and now a new and novel study on the much-analyzed quote backs him up. Researchers from Michigan State University and Ohio State University have "bolstered Neil Armstrong's side of the story," said Laura Dilley, an MSU assistant professor of communicative sciences and disorders. After becoming the first person to step on the moon in 1969, Armstrong said what was heard as: "That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind." You can hear the audio here. Later, as NASA explains, Armstrong said he had intended to say "a man," and thought he had.  But he agreed that "a" did not seem audible in the recording. Numerous intense studies have been carried out over the years, using high-tech equipment, all in the effort to discover whether he had indeed uttered that one little sound. In 2006, Peter Shann Ford said he had found the "a" in a study of the audio waveform, NASA explains.  Then, "more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and, most importantly, audio spectrograms.  None of these analyses support Ford's conclusion." First man on the moon gave rare interview Until now, perhaps. The MSU and OSU researchers took what they call a novel approach: studying how people from Armstrong's native central Ohio pronounce "for" and "for a." The team studied recordings of 40 people in Columbus, near Armstrong's native town of Wapakoneta.  They found numerous examples of "for" and "for a" sounding similar. Their results suggest that it is entirely possible that Armstrong said what he claimed, though evidence indicates that people are statistically more likely to hear 'for man' instead of 'for a man' on the recording," Michigan State University said in a news release. "We feel we've partially vindicated him," Dilley said.  "But we'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said." Recalling Armstrong's "life well-lived"	1

Afraid that her husband will leave her for a younger woman, a 107-year-old Malaysian woman is looking to marry again -- for the 23rd time. Wok Kundor: "I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone." Wok Kundor has been happily married for four years to her husband, a man 70 years her junior. But since he left their village in northern Terengganu state for a drug rehabilitation program in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, Wok has had a gnawing feeling. "She said that she has been feeling insecure lately and she needs to find out whether he still loves her or not," said R.S.N. Murali, a reporter for The Star. The English-language Malaysian daily was among several local media outlets reporting on the lifelong romantic. "She is worried he might not come back after his program and find himself a younger wife," Murali said. If so, Wok has her eyes set on a 50-year-old man, but hopes it does not come to that. "I realize that I am an aged woman. I don't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone," she told the newspaper. "My intention to remarry is to fill my forlornness," particularly during the Muslim month of fasting, Ramadan, she said. Malaysian media, which has previously reported on the woman, said Wok has been married 22 times. That would make her marriages last an average of four years. Wok would not discuss past relationships, Murali said. "Some of her better halves have passed away or have divorced, but she doesn't want to talk about them or her children," he said. Wok and her current husband, Mohammed Boor Che Musa, hail from the same village and met there. Muhammad, 37, was quoted in an earlier report as saying the couple fell for each other because it was "God's will." On Monday, he told The Star that he is still very much in love with his wife and cannot dream of life with someone else. But Wok wants to hear him say it, Murali said. Soon, the centenarian plans to make the journey to Kuala Lumpur -- if she can find a neighbor to drive her there.	1
Is she or isn't she? Pregnancy rumors and speculation are swirling around the world but the lady in question is saying nothing. This could easily be about a Hollywood star but this time, we're talking about the world's most reclusive nation, North Korea, and its first lady. Ri Sol Ju, the wife of young leader Kim Jong Un, has not been seen in public for around two months, according to North Korea watchers. A photo released by the state-run news agency KCNA shows her back in public and wearing a long coat that could be hiding a bump. Ri watched a football match and attended a musical concert with her husband Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the Kim Il Sung Military University. Read more: North Korea's leader still a mystery South Korean media has kicked into overdrive to speculate on whether she is pregnant or whether she was kept out of the public eye as a disciplinary measure for a perceived slight. Local media has claimed she may have fallen out of favor for not wearing a lapel pin of the former leaders, a requirement for adult North Koreans. "Rumors first came out from officials who attended the same event," said Kim Yong-hoon, head of the North Korean desk at Daily NK, an online newspaper based in Seoul that focuses on North Korea. "They started questioning and speculating if she was pregnant and it has spread throughout the country and that's how we heard about the rumors." Kim says the interest in whether Ri is pregnant is far higher outside of North Korea than it is inside, according to his sources inside the isolated nation. Read more: Power consolidation inside North Korea John Delury, assistant professor at Yonsei University says this global interest speaks volumes about the way any news about North Korea is handled. "Do we track the last time Michelle Obama showed up?" Delury says. "Our minds are so trained to do this with North Korea that we miss the bigger picture which is there is something new --and by almost international standards we could say more normal -- about the way she appears in public." By announcing Ri Sol Ju as his wife and having her accompany him on many public engagements, Kim Jong Un has shown a personality very different to his late father, Kim Jong Il.	1
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine" (Relic Entertainment, THQ) deftly takes the popular tabletop miniatures game and puts it into a video game with gun-blazing, sword-swinging action and a story that flows well. Players control Titus, a captain of the Ultramarines, as they and their comrades attempt to battle orks, demons and the forces of Chaos. There are plenty of weapons to satisfy your melee or missile tendencies in battle. All the action takes place in the third-person point of view, so the field of battle is easily kept in sight at all times. Minor enemies attack en masse and in waves, while tougher enemies usually show up to scrap all alone. Boss battles are demanding, and pulling off multiple attacks is almost required to conquer the last foe. Players often are accompanied by two other space marines who contribute to the wholesale slaughter of lesser opponents but seem to have little effect on boss battles. Hand-to-hand weapons can be knives, swords, axes and hammers while long-distance weapons start with pistols and go all the way to cannons. Ammunition and grenades can be found strewn around the battlefield to supply whatever weapons you have in your possession. Modes of combat are interchangeable and offer plenty of ways to wipe out enemies. Trigger buttons control the long-range weapons while controller buttons activate hand-to-hand abilities such as stun and execution. Performing an execution on a stunned enemy also rewards the player with points for good health. Hack-and-slash action makes for an enjoyable fight and really enhances the game. But it is more than just blood and gore (which, incidentally, gets splashed all over your character during battle, then magically disappears afterward) that make "Space Marine" worthy. The characters seem like they are ripped right from the British navy, with accents that sound like they come from the streets of London. Each character has his own feel and motivations, giving personality to even the lowliest speaking ones. The game's three main space marines all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies. They are outfitted in colorful armor that probably would feel right at home in a "World of Warcraft" setting but with nods to symbols and icons of ancient civilizations. I found myself listening a little more intently than normal as characters spoke about their trials and tribulations. Small bits of soldiers' lives were revealed, helping make the entire experience more immersive.	1
As we mark the 25th observance of World AIDS Day on December 1, we have a golden opportunity to begin to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. To start with, this has been an extraordinary year for HIV/AIDS research, with headline-grabbing  news emerging from a record number of scientists. Last week, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a thorough evaluation of the United States’ global response to prevent future epidemics; the World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, has issued recommendations on how to stop transmission.But the world needs more than a strong scientific effort to combat this pandemic, and there are ways in which the United States can play a key role. Here are some of the major actions the federal government, and state and local governments, can adopt to reduce the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.1. Educate the public“Public awareness of AIDS is not high,” says Peter Stothard, director of the U.K.’s National AIDS Trust, “and this is often a consequence of an unwillingness to talk about the disease, its importance, and its treatment options.” The U.S. government’s annual AIDS report, AIDS 2010: National Plan Against Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a prime example of how the public is being educated about AIDS. The report states: “Many people do not think that they are at risk for acquiring HIV or AIDS … [and] many Americans have yet to learn that they are now at risk. This is a growing public health issue and a significant impediment to achieving the U.S. HIV/AIDS pandemic goal.”The U.K. government could also play a role in educating the public. Its government’s Department of Health is a valuable partner in the fight against AIDS, not only because researchers are based there (the U.K. has an excellent network for global HIV/AIDS surveillance), but because the department plays a direct and necessary role in the public’s education about the disease. One recent example is a partnership between the department and the U.K.’s BBC that will help educate young people about issues related to AIDS for a whole year.2. Strengthen the global response“The United States can play a key role in ending HIV/AIDS by using its	0
In an attempt to curb runaway inflation, India's central bank raised its benchmark interest rates for the tenth time in sixteen months on Thursday, despite a slowdown in economic growth. The Reserve Bank of India said in a vernacular newspaper that a third monetary policy meeting planned for August had been postponed to September, after a meeting in July was postponed due to an attack on New Delhi."We have considered the possibility of further easing measures in the interim," RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday in an interview with news agency Reuters. He also said he wants to cut interest rates a further quarter of a percentage point. A quarter of a percentage point on a vernacular newspaper costs Rs.25. The last rate increase in April was to bring inflation down from a year-on-year increase of 18.7 percent in May to 6.7 percent in June, though that was not enough to stem the rise in prices on the back of rising food prices.The central bank has been increasingly hawkish in its monetary policy stance to combat runaway inflation after it raised the benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points in June. In a monetary policy statement on Wednesday, the central bank said its growth projections were now "much weaker", citing the slowdown in the industrial sector. The central bank has said the economy is expected to post a growth rate of just 3.3 percent in the current year, while inflation was seen rising to around 6 percent this year. It has also pointed out that the economy is now forecast to grow by just 6.6 percent this fiscal year. "If the growth rate is lower than 7.1 percent, if the inflation rate comes down, if the inflation curve looks benign, then the RBI will probably be tempted to cut rates further," Prathibha Rao, an economist at Credit Suisse said on Thursday.However, Rajan said the risks being taken now are in the wrong direction. "We are at risk of increasing the gap between rates and growth," he was quoted as saying in an interview with the English newspaper The Times of India. "If the gap is widening, then inflation will rise. The gap between RBI forecasts and growth will be higher next year than this," Rajan said, adding that the rate cut would be "very limited", and only a quarter or a third of the cut intended for this year. Rajan also cautioned against any increase in the fiscal deficit, as the central government may struggle to make the target	0
and police fear there may be other victims. Sean Banks, 37, met the victim on the streets of south London months after the attack. He was a regular customer at the bar and described the last few hours of his life to the Sunday Mirror.The victim "was on a night out with friends when he was attacked by two young men of Asian origin and one of them shouted 'kill me', " he told the tabloid."People are being robbed on the streets of London. I went down to the scene and it's a terrible sight, I've never seen anything like it."Police are still hunting other victims of the attack.A:This is clearly a racist attack.The victim was just a regular customer at the bar and described the last week of his life to the Sunday MirrorHe was on a night out with friends when he was attacked by two young men of Asian origin and one of them shouted 'kill me'People are being robbed on the streets of LondonI went down to the scene and it's a terrible sight, I've never seen anything like it.I don't think there's much more to say here. The race of the attackers was not a relevant factor in the crime, they were not targeting him because of his race. A:I see two problems with the answer from @HariChingader.  The first is that it is missing the fact that a man was murdered.  This is not a case of "We don't know the reason, the suspect might have been a rapist, or they might have been a rapist and mhurdered him because a rapist might be a rapist!".  It is one of "We don't know the reason, and we don't know who is guilty, but the fact that someone was murdered seems certain."You can see this clearly from the title of the article: "Bogdan Dzakovic was a regular customer at the venue and described his death to the Sunday Mirror."  This does not necessarily mean that he was murdered.In fact, the second problem is that it suggests that the victim's death is important to the story but that is not the case.  The only reason we know the victim was murdered is because someone else is describing the attack in the story.   The first problem is just that you don	0
long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week. Judge George O'Toole, along with the prosecution and defense departments, have agreed to submit arguments by Sept. 26. The government will urge the court to allow the case to move forward even though the defense has not been allowed to interview any of the witnesses it plans to call. That, in effect, is what the judge said will happen. But the defense has complained that the way the case is being managed is unfair. The government's case relies largely on the testimony of two witnesses who said they bought the car in question -- and testified at least twice about how they bought it. Their testimony has been attacked by both defense lawyers. The defense's main witness, Paul Cimino Sr., told the jurors in his deposition that he bought the blue Nissan in October 1987 and said he took the car in for service about a month later. He later testified that he had only seen the car for less than a week in April 1988. That, as well as a claim by Cimino's wife, Shirley Cimino, that she had been sleeping in the back seat of the car, was the basis of the government's accusations that the defense's case was undermined in various ways. At the trial, the prosecution produced evidence that the car had been repaired three times in 1987, once in 1987 and twice in 1988, by the same salesman who had certified the car as being in perfect operating condition in July 1988. One of the three times the car was repaired in 1987, it turned out that the part that had been recalled was installed during a previous service. The car was sold to Paul Cimino Jr., a man whose first name is spelled with an "i" but whose middle initial is "C" on the title, in May 1988. Cimino Jr. then sold it back to his father, and Paul Cimino Sr., in June 1988. The defense has offered no evidence that the car was not sold to the Cimino family. The judge will rule on the government's request to allow the defense to question witnesses, but that could be the last word on the matter. If the defense does have some kind of victory, it is unlikely to help the case if it is based	0
Former South African President Nelson Mandela has completed his recovery from a lung infection and gallstone surgery and is gradually getting back to his normal routine, a spokesman said Sunday. Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said Mandela, who has not appeared in public since 2010, continues to receive treatment at his home in Houghton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Mandela was hospitalized for a lung infection in early December and a week later underwent surgery for removal of gallstones. He was discharged from the hospital after a two-week stay Keep Nelson Mandela in thoughts and prayers, Zuma says During the time of apartheid in South Africa, Mandela was convicted of sabotage and was imprisoned for 27 years until 1990. He and former President F.W. de Klerk, who dismantled apartheid, shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. A year later, Mandela became the nation's first black president. In November, South Africa issued banknotes bearing Mandela's picture. Despite his rare public appearances in recent years, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Mandela's impact has extended far beyond the borders of his own country. After he left office in 1999, he was involved in mediating conflicts from Africa to the Mideast. Mandela, 94, also was treated for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011. The next month he had surgery for an abdominal hernia. Nelson Mandela timeline	1
It has now been certified officially: Germany is special, at least in the eyes of ratings agency Standard & Poor's. According to Standard & Poor's, Germany is the only country in the eurozone which still deserves the prized AAA  rating.In the words of the rating agency, the reasons for its decision are the following:"Germany's economy and political and social institutions foster strong growth and have been successful in integrating an ever-larger population into the job market. Germany's public finances are solid and it has no significant long-term challenges in the euro area which is in part attributable to effective fiscal management.""Germany's economic growth has been rapid and its political and social institutions have been strong. Unemployment has fallen from 6.3 percent in the early 2000s to 3.9 percent in early 2013, as a result of strong growth and job creation. The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent today and it is unlikely that unemployment will exceed 5.5 percent before the end of the decade. Growth has been strong and inflation steady. Germany has successfully weathered the crisis. The euro area's economic growth and employment rates were stronger than any other euro zone member.""Fiscal capacity, which had been a weakness in the euro area, has been strengthened by strong and effective revenue and expenditure management and Germany's ability to raise government revenues in the short-term without creating excessive deficits is the main reason Germany has a debt-to-GDP ratio that currently stands at around 60 percent. Germany's economic and financial strength are also reflected in its strong industrial output and employment growth which the economy generated in the last quarter of 2012 at the same time that it had the strongest growth in the euro area. Its financial strength and political stability have been important in dealing with the economic and financial crisis within the euro area but they will remain important factors in maintaining Germany's position as a leading economy and in future economic and financial crises.""Germany's financial institutions were strong and its banking sector was in good shape. While the eurozone's debt crisis has added to Germany's financial difficulties, the economic recovery is also providing additional resources to finance its debt and the economy is performing well in the medium term. The euro area's economic performance has been strong. The debt of the euro area's largest economy, Germany, averaged less than 90 percent of GDP in 2012. The average debt ratio in the euro area as a whole was 89.7 percent, slightly higher than	0
Editor's note: Meloney Dunning, this year's Real Simple "Life Lessons Essay Contest" winner, describes the heartbreaking day when she decided to say good-bye to her newborn son, who was born prematurely. (Real Simple) -- Sitting in the newborn intensive care unit five years ago, I could feel my heart pound in my chest and my throat tighten in panic at the sight of my son. Real Simple: How to make positive changes in your life The doctor had come to my bedside that morning and told me that Phoenix had suffered through a difficult night. But that didn't remotely prepare me for what I now witnessed. Alarms were ringing, the numbers on his monitors plummeting. All the while, my beautiful boy lay there, apparently peaceful, as chaos surrounded him. What frightened me most was that nobody rushed to his side. This state of frenzy, it seemed, was the status quo for our boy, and it was only my husband, Adam, and I who were distraught. Real Simple: How to tell if someone is lying Phoenix was just three days old. I had developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy and spent the last several weeks in the hospital, desperately trying to keep him inside and growing. Finally, at 27 weeks, my body decided that it could do no more. The doctors rushed me to the operating room, my frightened husband at my side, and delivered our tiny baby by Cesarean section. He was one pound, 12 ounces and just 12 inches long. Although he was very early and very small, I believed in him. I knew that he would thrive. Real Simple: How to stop procrastinating Now Adam and I sat at his bedside. After what felt like forever but was only a few minutes, the nurse approached us. She discussed some of Phoenix's challenges and went to get his doctor. We waited, choking back fear and praying for a miracle. Real Simple: 24 nutritious and tasty snacks	1
Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a $10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars, as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe at Zanu-PF National Political  Conference in Harare March 29, 2016 | REUTERS/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi (Zimbabwe-Reuters, Africa, Business)The U.S. and most other countries issued their currencies following the end of World War II based on the pound sterling. It was the currency of the country that was in control of that particular moment, and it became the currency of the country with which the war was waged, the country in control of that moment and a certain country to which the war continued.The new currency had to meet certain criteria. It had to be accepted everywhere by everyone and at the currency exchange rate at the time (the U.S. dollar then had a par rate of 4.4333:1 in 1960.) It had to be accepted everywhere on the same day and in the same amount by everyone. It had to be accepted everywhere in the currency of the country that was in control at the time (this was Britain at the time.) And it had to be accepted everywhere by everyone without any difference in amounts.In order to meet the first requirement, the new currency had to be accepted everywhere by everyone regardless of whether they possessed the currency. This would create an incentive to produce paper money or to print it up. The second requirement would make it unnecessary to print a paper currency if the world’s economies were functioning on barter. The third requirement is the one that really matters, what we are dealing with here, what is important is the amount of people that accept the new currency. If there are too few people in a country that have it, the currency will not be accepted. This is the principle on which the U.S. dollar, the U.S. greenback, the U.S. yen and so on are based.There is no principle that says that if the new currency is being used in too few people at the time it must be rejected. There is no principle that says that if the economy of a country is in a mess because there are too many people having the new currency at the time, that a country will be too poor. This is the problem facing Zimbabwe today.Zimbabwe	0
Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick arrived at his home in Hampton, Virginia, on Thursday morning. Michael Vick, left, arrives at federal court with attorney Billy Martin in Richmond, Viriginia, in 2007. "He is iphone only? " an officer asks a court officer at the Hampton airport during a brief exchange with Vick. Vick, who faces federal charges in a dog-fighting case, was on his way to see his children at the time of the encounter. AP Michael Vick was charged with animal fighting in April and could face up to 15 years in prison. It was the first time that a dog-fighting charges have been lodged against an NFL quarterback.A woman accused Vick of touching her sexually when he accompanied her to a Virginia hotel room on March 15. Vick also was accused of breaking in to her room and trying to force her to have sex with his dog. At the time, the charges were related to one occasion -- on March 16, 2007, Vick and his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, were at a Virginia hotel, which they had chosen for a date and for Vick -- when they met a woman with a dog. The woman was so freaked out by the meeting that she went to the police, who contacted Vick and Palmer.According to a police report, Vick told police that he and Palmer went to the hotel to look for Palmer's dog, but when she couldn't find it, she left, Vick said. Vick and Palmer left the hotel and drove to a convenience store for cigarettes. Later, they went to Walmart, where they returned the dog to the woman and parted ways.Vick returned to the hotel in the early morning hours of March 17 and took Palmer back to their room. The woman saw that there was no dog in the room, so she went into the bathroom, where Vick and Palmer were sleeping. The woman awoke Palmer, and, according to the police report, Palmer told her "that she 'had her period' and left the room, and Vick and Palmer left. " In other words, Vick was the aggressor.Police were able to recover a pair of pants from the bathroom as well as the woman's purse. The woman said she had slept in those pants the night of the hotel and that they were too small for her. According to police, the pants contained semen, a DNA test confirmed that DNA on the pants belonged to Palmer -- though	0
Rory McIlroy was confirmed as winner of the Race to Dubai Sunday despite not lifting a club in anger for six weeks. Victory for American Brooks Koepka in the Turkish Airlines Open -- at the expense of McIlroy's nearest Â£4 million rival to date -- secured him the title by 15 shots at the end of the final round, which was played at The Belfry and featured six playoff holes.All four players from the final group took five birdies to the last hole. McIlroy held two match holes in the playoff, the first of them on the 15th, which he took for bogey. Brooks Koepka birdied the par-5 16th by two feet, but Rory didn't birdie his first. He could have made the hole with only his first shot from the tee box, a chip which he had to get close to the hole to hit.The two players made the match in their different ways. Brooks Koepka was dominant with a 62 birdie and a final round effort which kept him one shot off the lead, and the only one to win on the weekend after the cut line was reached on the 17th.In contrast, he made the biggest birdie of the day at the 16th, where he holed his 15th putt of the day to get to the green in two-under par after coming to the par-3 one shot behind McIlroy, his nearest rival to date.To get to this day, Rory's tally was now 11-under par, while McIlroy's was 10-under par. Brooks Koepka said at the time that he wasn't disappointed in his efforts given his long pre-tournament preparation and having finished second at the Dubai Masters on Sunday. But he also said that he would finish his career with the same amount of golf he started with, and he was the best player at the last four major championships.Rory McIlroy's record on the week that he shot his lowest score in a majorHe will end his professional career with an 18-under par, the joint lowest overall single-round score in major championship history, in 18 rounds that he has played in five majors.

At least 510 people were killed in Caracas, Venezuela, in December, giving support to a recent report that called the city the murder capital of the world. A chalk message reads No More Murders as a student protests  killings in  Caracas  [7].This is not the first study of homicides in Venezuela. In 2015, a report by Human Rights Watch suggested Venezuela had the world’s highest homicide rate — five times the number of deaths in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States in 2015. Venezuela was second only to Mexico in the Global Study on Homicide 2015 published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The number of homicides in Venezuela in 2015 was 2,077, compared with 2,046 reported in 2014.In 2016 the number of homicides in Venezuela surpassed those in Caracas. In May, more than 1,100 people were reported killed in the Venezuelan capital.In 2016, Venezuela was the sixth deadliest country in the world.According to the UNODC report, 754,000 people (2 percent of the population) were killed in the world last year, a rise of 2.4 percent over 2015. The global death rate was 7.1 per 100,000 people, up from 6.9 per 100,000 in 2015. While the rate of violent death in the United States was down by 0.8 percent, it was up by 3.6 percent in the United Kingdom, where there were 1,941 homicides in 2016, up from 1,822 in 2015.On July 27, President Nicolás Maduro signed an order, known as the Second National Plan of Security, which created a national anti-crime authority with the powers of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH), the Organization of American States, and the United States. The document will serve as the legal basis for establishing a national strategy to combat crime and terrorism, as well as the creation of a central database for law enforcement agencies.A few days later, the government of Nicolás Maduro announced it had discovered a plot to assassinate President Maduro, with more than 80 members of the security apparatus and criminal organizations involved. The plot was uncovered when Maduro ordered the arrest of a member of the police for allegedly leading an armed robbery.On August 5, a judge issued an arrest warrant for Raul Mesa for allegedly leading a drug trafficking group, but	0
which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed. They rarely get a straight answer. Instead, Danbury residents see jokes, meme-filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from "Glee" or "Grease" -- all courtesy of Mayor Mark Boughton, a social-media prankster whose @MayorMark account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery. "Attention: West Beverly Hills High School is closed for tomorrow. #90210," read one recent mayoral tweet. Boughton always gets around to the real news eventually. But first come the wisecracks. He was in especially rare form Tuesday night, tweeting almost a dozen snow-day jokes, Storify user and freelance journalist Kristin Hussey chronicled, as yet another storm hit Danbury. Parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating. But on Twitter, at least, many students seem to get the joke. "@MayorMark you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you're causing us," wrote one. "The kids take it tongue in cheek. They understand, because it's sort of a tradition around here," said Boughton, who told CNN he's been trading jokes about snow days with students on Twitter for several years now. "We go back and forth. But it's all in good fun." One twist of the whole thing is that Boughton doesn't even make the call about closing Danbury schools. That decision is left to Superintendent of Schools Sal Pascarella, who confers with Boughton by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent's phone. But Boughton, who ran for governor of Connecticut last year and has 18,000 Twitter followers, usually posts his school-closing tweets first. Finally, after hours of build-up, the mayor gave people of Danbury the news at 6:21 a.m. Wednesday: Schools would open two hours late. The mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny. "I have a very serious policy side ... but I like to have a good chuckle," he said. "That's who I am. In the end, I think it (social media) is about being yourself."	1
The young girl whispered in a hushed tone. She looked down as she spoke, only glancing up from her dark round eyes every now and then. She wanted to tell more, but she was too ashamed. She was just 9 years old when, she says, Congolese soldiers gang-raped her on her way to school. The young girl on the right says she was raped by Congolese soldiers. She was just 9 when it happened. "These two soldiers nabbed her, put a bag over her head and pulled her into the bushes. She explains it as, 'They got me,' " says Sherrlyn Borkgren, who spent a month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo late last year. Borkgren, a wedding photographer and freelance journalist, traveled to the war-torn region of eastern Congo after being awarded the ShootQ Grant, a $10,000 award to free photographers from everyday life to pursue a project that raises awareness of an important global issue. Borkgren pauses when she speaks of meeting the girl. "She was obviously very traumatized to repeat this out loud, and I don't think she had repeated it to anyone." The young girl lied to her about her age when they first spoke. "She said she was 15 when she was raped," Borkgren says. "I figured she probably wanted to say she was 15 because it's more acceptable than to say, 'I was 9 when they raped me.' " The United Nations estimates 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Congo over the last 12 years, when war broke out with Rwanda and Uganda backing Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-Congo President Laurent Kabila. Rape became a weapon of war, aid groups say. "It is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman or girl," says Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch who has spent the last 10 years focusing on Congo. "These are often soldiers and combatants deliberately targeting women and raping them as a strategy of war, either to punish a community, to terrorize a community or to humiliate them." Most times, the women are raped by at least two perpetrators. "Sometimes, that is done in front of the family, in front of the children," Van Woudenberg says. She sighs, "What causes men to rape -- I wish I had an answer to that."	1
She's been called "America's mom." Strangers stop her for hugs in the airport. And she still dishes up kindly parental wisdom daily in reruns of "The Brady Bunch." "Brady Bunch" actress Florence Henderson founded  Mom's Organic Pantry. And yes, people take pictures of her in front of a baby and her children and she's so grateful."I get to spend my life with God's love, so when people ask me, 'How did you do it?' I will tell them I had a family."She's also very grateful. In the 1980s, Henderson spent time in the South. She and her husband, Rick, and three kids moved from California to Florida to live in a small town with a population of 700. On weekends, she was "in charge of the nursery. Everybody just helped me. It was pretty amazing."Henderson has four children now. But when she had her first, Emily, she was not quite in the swing of parenting. Emily and her older sister, Maddy, were not the children Henderson's motherly instincts said she should have been."I remember I was sitting in a waiting room and looking away and just kind of letting myself cry a little bit," Henderson says. "I didn't know how to make her feel better."Henderson had a tough time getting through her first hour of training to become a registered nurse. But then she looked at a picture of a 3-year-old holding a newborn and was "absolutely overcome.""I said, 'I'll start this day right now. I'll do it for her. I will do it for these kids,' " Henderson says. "I wouldn't go back."In the last quarter century Mom's Organic Pantry has grown from a small organic grocery to a thriving organization that helps many parents and families.Henderson was the CEO from January 2002 until March 2011. She had a good run. She says she received "a lot of attention" after a 2004 column in USA Today. Her mom, who had been a teacher, saw the column and told her to keep going and she did. She says Henderson "didn't have to think about it."She says the day's top priority was to make the most nutritious and affordable food that parents and kids could buy.

Comprehensive immigration reform. Suddenly the phrase is on everyone's lips. From President Barack Obama to rising Republican star Sen. Marco Rubio to right-wing television hosts Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. As if by magic, everybody's for it after six years of ducking and using reform as a political wedge issue -- everybody wants to get it done. But what exactly is it? What kinds of changes will it entail, and what will they mean for America? After more than 10 years of on-and-off debate in Washington, the most important piece of the puzzle is still rarely discussed and poorly understood. Obama often talks about reform without even mentioning it. It never came up on the campaign trail. It's not what brought Latinos out to vote in record numbers. And although it's likely to be included in the framework for reform expected to be released Monday by a bipartisan group of Senators, the concept gets very little attention from the media, English- or Spanish-language. iReport: Under deportation, above fear What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the U.S. economy. Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States. Many have been here for years and have put down roots. We're not going to deport them -- not even the harshest restrictionists think that's practical. Nor are most likely to go "home" voluntarily, no matter how difficult we make their lives with tough enforcement. For the overwhelming majority, America is home by now. And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come. News: Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape But most contentious is not the same as most important. We all must ask: What created this problem in the first place? Exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of Ohio? The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no "line" -- no available visas.	1
If Super Bowl Sunday is a day you look forward to with great anticipation each year, if it is a day that you equate with excitement and good times, there's something you should know: You may have a politician to thank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for, for goodness sake, a day that many people get to celebrate. But you may not be so lucky as to have a senator to thank Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ day, and neither will I.Let's recap:In the wake of last week's tragic Newtown massacre of 20 young children and six teachers, Congress spent two weeks in a frenzied search for a bipartisan solution to gun violence, but found none.On Thursday, the Senate finally passed a bipartisan bill that included common-sense measures, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity-firearm magazine clips, among other restrictions. It received wide praise, including from President Obama who called it a "good first step" and praised senators who offered up their amendment, which included a provision that would require background checks for every purchaser and transfer of a gun.But the bill failed, which was not surprising given the rancorous debate on Capitol Hill. But now it is only a matter of time before the House can take up the measure.So for all of your Super Bowl party planning, you could say goodbye to Monday's big day.Of course, the big day has to come sometime, sometime, because if you missed out on the Senate vote, you could still get the word out. For example, you could write a letter to your local newspaper, explaining to readers why you support the bill and urge them to support it as well. Or you could ask your city council to make a motion to urge their members to support the bill in committee.If you would like to get organized, I've put together a comprehensive guide to help you get the word out and be the hero of the dayI have one more idea I'm still gathering information on. It is going to be a fun challenge, but I am positive it will be worth it.In one of our regular discussion groups, a fellow asked me to address this question:"What do you think is the first step that needs to be taken to end gun violence and	0

Eric Mace says he thought he was giving his daughter good advice by asking her to sit up front in class. Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at Northern Illinois University. "I'd like you to sit in the front row of every class that you're in and constantly drag information out of these people, and if you don't understand what they're talking about, raise your hand and say, 'I don't get it' until you get it," Mace recalled telling her. His daughter, 19-year-old Ryanne, took that advice. Now, he wishes she would have sat somewhere else. Mace believes that Ryanne was probably one of the first to be killed in the Northern Illinois University shootings a year ago, because she was in the front row in the lecture at Cole Hall. "She was, from what I understand, in the front row of that room and was probably the first one that had shots fired at her after the gentleman that was on stage," Mace said. "It's not an easy thing to carry, but I shouldn't have to carry it, either." Ryanne was Eric and Mary Kay Mace's only child. She was one of five NIU students killed on Valentine's Day last year by Steven Kazmierczak, a former NIU student who was attending graduate school at the University of Illinois in Champaign. "It's difficult. There's always an ache, loneliness and a longing. We're going to miss her every day for the rest of our lives," Mary Kay Mace said. Her husband added, "I go to bed thinking about her. I wake up in the morning thinking about her. Any time that I've a free moment, it will pop up." The Maces said they would like to know more about the police investigation into the shooting and Kazmierczak's history of mental illness. Police records provided to CNN indicate that he had a long history of mental problems, including several suicide attempts. The parents also are angry that he was able to buy guns.	1
A new lawsuit alleges that convicted swindler Bernie Madoff financed a cocaine-fueled work environment and a "culture of sexual deviance," and he diverted money to his London, England, office when he believed federal authorities were closing in at home. A new lawsuit alleges Bernie Madoff financed a sex-and-drugs workplace with investors' money. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New York's State Supreme Court, was brought on behalf of former investors and seeks unspecified punitive damages and compensation. Beyond that, it offers a look at what the plaintiffs' attorneys say was once Madoff's multimillion-dollar empire and what is now his world in a federal prison in North Carolina. Among the allegations in the 264-page lawsuit are that during the mid-1970s, Madoff began sending employees to buy drugs for company use. The complaint alleges that some employees and investors were aware of the drug purchases, and that BMIS [Bernard Madoff Investment Services] was known by insiders as the "North Pole" in reference to the excessive amount of cocaine use in the work place. Attorneys Joseph Cochett and Nancy Fineman filed the complaint based on an investigation, including a four-hour interview with Madoff in prison in July, that they conducted for former investors. They also allege that major financial institutions, including KPMG, the Bank of New York and JP Morgan Chase, were aware that Madoff was transferring stolen funds to his London office for personal purchases. According to the complaint, Madoff transferred funds to London to buy extravagant personal items. "In 2006 Madoff thought the end was near because the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] investigated. He realized he had to change things up so his focus shifted to London," Fineman said. "We know that KPMG were the auditors for the London branch and that money was used to buy yachts and Bentleys, they are supposed to look at related-party transactions. KPMG should have noticed these as a red flag." Officials of KPMG and the Bank of New York did not immediately respond to calls from CNN Wednesday evening for comment on the lawsuit. JP Morgan Chase spokesman Tom Kelly said, "We do not comment on pending litigation." The alleged illicit behavior outlined in the complaint did not stop at drug use and extravagant spending. Company parties consisted of topless entertainers, and some employees had affairs in places such as Madoff's own office, the lawsuit says.	1
He's gone. So, now what? How do those who clogged the streets of Egypt on Wednesday wanting so desperately to oust Mohamed Morsy, the now-deposed president of Egypt, feel about the future now it appears to be wide open? There's one thing that is for sure. Those who used to think that if Mubarak and his son, Gamal, were removed the Egyptian people would have a new leader, a new government, that there would be space to breathe, that they would have the opportunity to express themselves freely, have been proved wrong. I doubt that any of the thousands of protests in Egypt from Wednesday are going to be easily contained and are likely to grow.If only Mubarak and his sons could have seen the writing on the wall. But, that is not the case.In the past, Mubarak and his sons have tried every means possible to try and prevent any change. They've never really left Egypt. Now, that's all gone. And, the world is going to watch as the old order is rolled back and the new era of freedom for Egypt is ushered in.But to do this, one must understand what Morsy is attempting to do. There has been a lot of misunderstanding about his intentions.He's not in the political arena. He's not running for president. He is not seeking an elected position. He is not trying to oust the president.He is doing something entirely different - he is trying to reform the military.When Morsy first announced his intention to run for the presidency back in 2011, the military didn't agree.Morsy made a number of attempts to force the military to accept an elected president, but they always refused. Then he went after the officer corps and the military academy. He made a list of things the military would have to cut and gave it to them. And, in November 2011, the army chief of staff, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, announced his plans to run for president.There was a bit of a stir about all of that. But, then, Morsy was shot dead while attempting to enter the president's palace. That got everyone's attention. We thought maybe Morsy had a legitimate chance of becoming Egypt's president.So, when Morsy first became president, the military chief of staff, Abdul Fattah el	0
The numbers were good for "Knowing." In "Knowing," a physics professor (Nicolas Cage) ponders patterns in a list of numbers. The film, about a physics professor who sees clues for disastrous events in a time  clock, starts with "Looking at the numbers." It then shifts to the professor and his colleagues observing a clock, each number beginning to reveal the next. Cage plays an academic who's fascinated by how events follow one another. When he's in his laboratory, he has an airtight explanation for the pattern, but he soon realizes that he can't stop it. We can see what he sees. But, ultimately, he has to face the numbers, and he has to give in to the pattern, even though he's already seen what he should have seen. Cage's characters face a similar predicament. They're on the run, and they're looking for ways to escape to another world. One of the people they find on his way out is a cat named Wanda. She plays a crucial role in understanding the story's "pattern." "Looking at the numbers" was a good sign for "Knowing," but "Seeing" was its best shot at good "Numbers." Even the best numbers are only numbers if we know they're numbers before they're numbers."Seeing" was a good film, but to say that it was a great film is not a fair judgment. No story comes to us fully formed. The best we can hope for is to get close enough to know that it's there. If "Seeing" had taken its story in a different way or if it had taken the same path it would have been a better story, but it didn't. The film was about numbers, but the numbers were only as real as the story itself.#  "GIVEN NOTHING TO DO."An old man sits on a park bench, playing his accordion.

The electronic component visible in a law enforcement image of an intercepted suspicious shipment from Yemen appears to be a printed circuit board from a disassembled cell phone, an engineer told CNN Friday. "This size and the shape of iphone, I think it's a printed circuit board from one of the iPhones."A photo of the cellphone-sized electronic component found in the cargo of a suspected container of contraband destined to the United States was recently published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some experts believe it could be the components of a phone used by the late Saudi monarch, King Abdullah.But the picture was not made public by the agency, which said that the image was a product of the FBI's Law Enforcement Surveillance Center (LESCo) in Baltimore.Hany El-Sayed, a technology and computer engineering professor at the University of Maryland, had previously published an image of the electronic component, which appeared to be another piece of printed circuit board from an iPhone. He posted a digital image of that device on his blog in January 2016."There is, indeed, an iphone component in the image," Mr. El-Sayed wrote in an email.What is known is that the electronic component in the LESSCo photos has been widely recognized as an iPhone part. But, as is the case with many of the pictures from the FBI's investigation, a photo is not the same as a piece of technology."This is the same piece of circuit board as the one at the top of this post," Mark L. Smithing, a member of the LESSCo that took the image, told CNN Friday.The circuit board is a printed circuit card, or a printed circuit board (PCB), containing thousands of electronic components, from electronic components to integrated circuits, for example, and the like. It can be a single, relatively large piece of board or a stack of multiple boards.The iphone-size component is believed to be one part of a circuit board from an iPhone. The electronic component is made of gold foils and is about 6 centimetres on each side, or about a meter on each side. It is 3 mm thick, or about 1/8 inch.The LESSCo website said in a statement that the image is an internal document and that the circuit board is under investigation and that "No	0
A NEW OIL REALITY Over three years of high oil prices have led to a boom time for the region's oil industry, including an eightfold increase in production at some drilling sites, the growth in the number of new drilling rigs, and a huge increase in discoveries of oil and gas. The result has been a huge increase in oil and natural gas prices in California and the West. As a result, over 200,000 new jobs have been created in California's energy industry, as well as thousands of temporary construction jobs in new oil and gas drilling sites. WHY WE NEED TO INVEST IN OIL The oil and gas industry is under intense pressure to continue to keep its investments in new oil and gas drilling sites and new well-head equipment. But there are risks in keeping a high level of production at existing sites, and the industry needs to make the most of every new well it discovers or enlarges. WHY WE NEED LONG-RANGED OIL AND GAS PROFESSIONALS  The industry has long had an unfairly low reputation for its quality of service, reliability and expertise. The California Independent System Operator,s (CAISO) recently reported that there were 18,000 quality control deficiencies on some new equipment. CAISO,s quality management program has been plagued by problems and cost overruns. HOW WE CAN GET MORE OIL AND GAS This is a new industry and needs new ways to build brand loyalty, gain market share and deliver a superior experience. The industry should use the information we provide to educate customers about the value of good service; to engage customers through advertising, customer relationship management, event marketing, and sales promotion; and to increase awareness of the new generation of oil and gas equipment and the industry,s service abilities. EXCITEMENT OF ALL GRADES &We have never seen anything like this in the industry,8 said Steven Stengel, president of Encana Corporation, one of the world,s largest oil companies. &We have never produced so much oil, nor found so many places where oil could be produced.8 CONSERV	0
It's the end of the day in rural southwest Wisconsin, and the Trocke family wanders through a ditch along a county road, their eyes fixed on the earth. Dan and Laurie Trocke, and their three kids, are on a mission for fragments of rock that came from about as far away as one can imagine. "We're not finding a lot, but that's beside the point really," Laurie Trocke says.  "We're not professionals. It's purely for fun." It all began the evening of April 14, when what looked like a giant fireball came crashing through the atmosphere. "It just lit up the whole sky," she says. "You thought it was thunder and lightning, but it just kept going and going and going." "It really didn't sound natural," Dan Trocke adds. What they were witnessing was a meteor -- and a pretty spectacular one at that. Watch the video Michael Farmer, whom the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, calls the "world's top meteorite hunter," said that as soon as he saw video of the display, he hopped a flight to Wisconsin. "Most of them don't make a light show or a sound show," Farmer said. "When this one came in, the energy released was like nuclear bomb-type energy. ... [I knew] there would be thousands of pieces on the ground." By definition, those pieces are what scientists call meteorites: the remnants of the meteor that don't burn up along the journey and instead make it all the way to the ground. Farmer headed to the sleepy Wisconsin village of Livingston, which was about to become ground zero for the latest meteorite hunt. Livingston, with a population of 597, was the town nearest to where the otherworldly bits were turning up. Soon, everyone wanted a piece of the action -- from internationally known experts to the locals, like 7-year-old Jackson McCluskey. Jackson, along with dozens of other students at Iowa Grant Elementary School in Livingston, learned about the meteors from geologists and meteorite-hunting experts at a school assembly.  Later that day, the kids combed the school grounds for meteorites during recess. McCluskey found a rock that one of the experts confirmed was a meteorite, weighing 35 grams.  He sold it to a collector, but they wouldn't say for how much.	1
Donna Summer, the "Queen of Disco" whose hits included "Hot Stuff," "Bad Girls," "Love to Love You Baby" and "She Works Hard for the Money," has died, a representative said Thursday. She was 63. Her publicist, Brian Edwards, said Summer was suffering from cancer. She died surrounded by her family in Florida, he said. "Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith," a family statement said. "While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time." Summer first rose to fame the mid-'70s, thanks to "Love to Love You Baby." The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans helped define the mid-'70s disco trend and hit No. 2 in 1976. Summer followed the song with such hits as "I Feel Love," "Last Dance" and a disco-fied version of the Richard Harris hit "MacArthur Park," which outdid Harris' version by hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It was Summer's first of four chart-toppers. Fans, friends react to Summer's death But with her 1979 album "Bad Girls," Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, which had become renewed by the success of the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. "Bad Girls" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, "Hot Stuff" and "Bad Girls," as well as a Top 10 ballad, "Dim All the Lights." However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, "The Wanderer," went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of "Bad Girls," a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1. It wasn't until 1983's "She Works Hard for the Money," which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late '70s zenith.

A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. "Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here," a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter	1
I hope you have a boy." These were the words of a well-wisher to Queen Elizabeth II (then Princess Elizabeth) and Prince Philip on the eve of the birth of their first child in 1948. Prospects look  good for the next royal newborn, who will be born in May or June 1997, the last in the century the British royal family has produced a baby: the fourth wife of William, Prince of Wales, and fourth child of Queen Elizabeth II.The baby named after the Queen's father is not exactly royalty. He is third in the line of succession from the mother of Queen Elizabeth II. Though Queen Elizabeth II became the wife of the Prince of Wales in 1952 after marrying then–future king George VI, she remained, legally, a princess until the end of her life, when she became one of two surviving daughters of her mother, the Queen mother. On her death, the Princess Elizabeth's children, her grandchildren, would be third in a long line of succession to the British throne. The baby's name is not that of the Queen's own father—his name is Prince Charles Edward—and it is not, in fact, a prince. But it is a new Royal Baby who will be the subject of what will be a particularly special chapter of royal history: a royal baby whose name is likely to be the very first in the record of the Royal Family. And there can certainly be no doubt in anyone's mind that he will change the course of the monarchy's history as well as that of British and world history.The first of the new Royal Babies was the baby named after the Queen's mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. This was not her name in the sense that she is Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon today. The name came from her parents, Anne and Philip Bowes-Lyon, who in the early nineteenth century adopted the surname Bowes-Lyon when they entered the House of Lords. But it was not their children's legitimate surname—as it would be today. The Royal Family was not a branch of the English aristocracy. It was not a social club, with a social register from which one could determine one's pedigree. It was a family that had been established for centuries and would be carried on until at least the century of Elizabeth II, and perhaps beyond.And yet it is worth remembering that in a sense the Royal Family is much more than a family.

Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians. Sri Lankan troops at Elephant Pass, the isthmus that connects north Jaffna peninsula to rest of the country. "It's an incredibly serious situation," James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. "We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone." Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. "Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track," Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. "This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," he said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. "The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. "They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had." Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. "This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk," Elder said.	1
one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks. By a 230-189 tally almost strictly on party lines, the House passed a short-term government spending plan that would eliminate all funding for Obamacare. The measure now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, which is certain to reject the provision that defunds President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement of his first term. Even though House Republicans now have voted 42 times to repeal or otherwise undermine Obamacare, Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republicans held a brief victory rally after Friday's action and challenged the Senate to follow their lead. "The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare," the Ohio Republican said to applause and cheers. "The House has listened to the American people. Now it's time for the United States Senate to listen to them as well." In a display of the raw politics of the battle, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia called out  Senate Democrats facing re-election next year by name, asking how Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Kay Hagan of North Carolina will vote on the House proposal. "It's up to Senate Democrats to follow House Republicans and show some responsibility," Cantor said. Later Friday, Obama accused conservative Republicans of holding the nation hostage by trying to make passing a federal budget and increasing the debt ceiling contingent on defunding health care reforms. "You don't have to threaten to blow the whole thing up if you don't get your way," Obama said in a campaign-style speech at a Ford plant in the Kansas City, Missouri area, adding that legislators in Washington were focused on politics and "trying to mess with me," rather than helping the middle class. In legislative jargon, the House passed a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded for the first 11 weeks of the fiscal year that begins October 1. Without some kind of spending measure by then, parts of the government would have to curtail services or shut down. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? Conservatives tie Obamacare to budget talks The controversy involves the provision demanded by the GOP's conservative wing and agreed to by Boehner that eliminates all funding for the 2010 health care reforms popularly known as Obamacare. Approval by the House set in motion a Capitol Hill showdown that will continue through October, when the nation's debt ceiling must be increased so the government can pay all its bills.	1
A 23-year-old exchange student, attacked in her Toronto apartment while a friend in China watched via computer webcam, was found dead there hours later, police say. Toronto Police on Monday identified the student as Qian (Necole) Liu of Beijing. She was talking early Friday morning to a male friend from home when a man allegedly knocked on her door, asking to use her phone, police said in a news release. The online witness said he saw Liu and the unknown man struggle for a time before the attacker turned off her laptop, the news release said. The friend in China then started a desperate bid to find out what happened, CNN-affiliate CTV reported. Ten hours later, police arrived at the basement apartment to find Liu's body, naked from the waist down. Her laptop was missing. "It was obvious that she had been dead for some period of time," Detective Sgt. Frank Skubic said in the news release. The cause of the death is yet to be determined, the news release said. There were no obvious signs of sexual assault or severe physical trauma, and police are awaiting toxicology reports, it said. Police are unsure whether Liu, an exchange student at York University, knew the man. The attacker was described as white, age 20 to 30, 6 feet tall, weighing 175 to 200 pounds, with a muscular build and medium-length brown hair, and wearing a blue crew-neck T-shirt. With no suspects and no one in custody, police have been questioning neighbors, CTV reported. A cell phone found in the apartment is also undergoing forensic examination, police said. York University President Mamdouh Shoukri released a statement saying, "Qian's death is a terrible tragedy and our entire community mourns the loss of a promising young student." Liu's family is currently on their way to Canada from China, CTV reported. A call to police seeking further comment was not immediately returned. This is not the first time a crime has been captured by webcam. In the most notorious incident, Meleanie Hain of Lebanon, Pennsylvania was shot dead in 2009 while talking to a friend via webcam. The friend was looking away when he heard a shot and a scream, police said. Upon looking back at the screen, the friend saw Hain's husband firing a handgun at where his wife had been, they said. Police later found both Hain and her husband dead in their home.	1
The death toll from a massive landslide that struck in Washington state's Cascade Mountains rose Tuesday to 35, the Snohomish County medical examiner said. Eleven people are still missing after a rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the rural town of Oso on March 22. The news came as the White House announced President Barack Obama will visit the area on April 22, the one month anniversary of the slide, and meet with search crews. "First and foremost our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who lost a loved one and those whose friends and family remain missing as a result of this devastating incident," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. Asked during the briefing if it would be a routine visit, Carney said "the pain of the family members who loved ones is not routine." "It's unique in each case and each instance," Carney said. "And I think the President is as heartbroken by this event, as he has been on each occasion that something like this has happened in the country, where he traveled to participate in ceremonies or services that commemorate those lost and celebrate their lives." Search crews continue to dig through deep, gelatinous mud and debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing. Of the 34 recovered bodies, 30 have been identified, the medical examiner said. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.	1
Party primaries for Nigeria's presidential election will begin November 26, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced Tuesday. The vernacular name for the elections was the "M-For-Me-I-Don't-Believe-It" primaries.According to The Associated Press, the primaries are part of a process to prepare for a presidential election in October. vernacular translation: "the people's primaries," which was the basis for the 1992 contest.In an AP report, the elections were part of a wider attempt to create a government that is "nearly" representative of the Nigerian people and not the ruling party, AP said. The elections were planned by the electoral body with the support of a small number of opposition politicians. The United States has expressed concern, saying that the elections were in violation of the country's democratic principles.Protestors have been calling for the withdrawal of the military from Nigeria because its soldiers have killed protesters and burned down buildings over the last year.Nigeria's civilian presidency and the ruling party agreed last month to form a national unity government. But opposition leaders have refused to join and have criticized the decision, saying it is too early to reach a decision.The elections are also seen as part of a plan by Nigeria's military to shore up support among its troops for the next presidential election, which will be held on October 15.Also, the election is seen as a test of the credibility of the opposition to the military.The last election process was overseen by a "caretaker government" run by General Ibrahim Babangida from July 1996 until October 1996. The process was disrupted by a power struggle between civilians and the military in February 1997.In June this year, the United States called on the Nigerian military to release political prisoners to end the ongoing power struggle between the two parties. An agreement to end the power struggle has not been reached.The military has been accused of taking part in the killings of opposition supporters, activists and journalists. In July 1999, 11 opposition leaders were killed by the military.Nigeria's military has been blamed for the deaths of at least 2,000 people since the power struggle in 1996. Human rights groups have reported that security forces have been implicated in the murders of people who they view as hostile to government policies. One of the victims of the February 1997 events was journalist and activist Alex Okike.N	0
Super Bowl fans in Tucson, Arizona, caught a different kind of show during Sunday's big game. Just as Cardinals' superstar Larry Fitzgerald watched himself sprint into the end zone on the stadium's Jumbotron during Sunday's Super Bowl, 10 seconds of eye-popping pornographic imagery "flashed" across the screens of those watching at home. "We are mortified by last evening's Super Bowl interruption, and deeply apologize to our customers for the inappropriate programming," Comcast Cable said in a written statement. "Our initial investigation suggests this was an isolated malicious act," the statement added. Comcast, and several local television stations that carried the signal, say they are currently investigating what caused the interruption. "It appears this material was only viewed by some Comcast customers," local Tucson television station KVOA-TV said in a written statement. Television station KVOA added "when the NBC feed of the Super Bowl was transmitted from KVOA to local cable providers and through over-the-air antennas, there was no pornographic material," KVOA President and General Manager Gary Nielsen said in a separate statement.	1
Political chaos roiled oil-rich Venezuela Friday after intelligence agents in the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro arrested the mayor of Caracas. The arrest came just days after Maduro accused the mayor of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government. Agents arrested Mayor Antonio Ledezma -- a well-known opposition politician -- on Thursday in a raid that sparked a fierce outcry from the president's political opponents. President Nicolas Maduro said the mayor will be prosecuted "so that he answers for all of the crimes committed against the peace, security and constitution of our country." In a televised address, Maduro said Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma was captured by order of the Attorney General's Office. A high-level Venezuelan military source with knowledge of the situation told CNN en Español the mayor was taken into custody because of his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the government an accusation Maduro leveled last week. Ledezma denied it, calling it the government's latest attempt to manufacture controversy and target political opponents. In 2009, Ledezma staged a hunger strike to protest the political tactics of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. His attorney, Omar Estacio, decried his detention. Ledezma was "virtually kidnapped," Estacio said, calling it "a violation of the most fundamental principles of Venezuelan law and international law." The mayor's office told CNN en Español that more than 150 intelligence agents participated in Thursday's raid. "They destroyed the doors," his wife, Mitzy Capriles, told CNN en Español. "There was no room for mediation. (My husband) was asking them to please stay calm and was asking what was going on. Abruptly, pushing and shoving, and without saying a word a gigantic, enormous contingent of agents, who were all over the place on the sixth-floor office where he works part of the day, took him away." Richard Blanco, an opposition Venezuelan lawmaker whose office is also in the building, said he witnessed Ledezma's arrest. "They pushed me as well and they pointed their guns at me," he said. "They broke the metropolitan mayor's office glass doors with a sledgehammer." Opposition leaders said Ledezma was a political prisoner unjustly held by the government. Word of his detention spread rapidly on social media after a Twitter post from the mayor's account Thursday evening said his office had been surrounded by police.	1
Pulitzer Prize-winning author, radio host and activist Studs Terkel died in his Chicago, Illinois, home Friday at the age of 96. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel died at his home Friday at the age of 96. Terkel had grown frail since the publication last year of his memoir, "Touch and Go," said Gordon Mayer, vice president of the Community Media Workshop, which Terkel had supported. "I'm still in touch, but I'm ready to go," he said last year at his last public appearance with the workshop, a nonprofit that recognizes Chicago reporters who take risks in covering the city. "My dad led a long, full, eventful -- sometimes tempestuous -- satisfying life," his son Dan said in a statement. "The last time I saw him, he was up, about, and mad as hell about the Cubs," workshop President Thom Clark said in the statement. Terkel, known for his portrayal of ordinary people young and old, rich and poor, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his remembrances of World War II, "The Good War." iReport.com: Remebering the legacy of Studs Terkel Terkel was born in New York but moved to Chicago, where his parents ran a small hotel. Terkel would sit in the hotel lobby watching droves of people arguing, fighting, ranting and telling stories. "That hotel was far more of an education to me than the University of Chicago was," Studs told CNN in 2000. It seems that beginning would pave the way for Terkel's love of passing on people's oral histories. He could often be found behind a tape recorder talking to the people who would eventually become the basis for his books. Terkel became famous, if not synonymous with oral histories, for his ability to cast a light on the working class. "Oral history preceded the written word," Terkel told CNN in 2000. "Oral history is having people tell their own stories and bringing it forth. "That's what history's about: the oral history of the unknowns that make the wheel go 'round. And that's what I'm interested in."	1
Shots were fired Sunday near a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland, but the motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, according to the Interior Ministry of Georgia. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, shown in France on November 13, called the incident a provocation. The ministry said the motorcade, which carried Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's South Ossetia region when the shots were fired. No other shooting was reported in the area. South Ossetia was the site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August. The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. Saakashvili later told reporters the incident "clearly was intended as a provocation." He said that he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed "you are dealing with unpredictable people" in the disputed area. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency Interfax said the command of the Russian peacekeeping force in South Ossetia denied blame for the gunfire. "Allegations that Russian military personnel were involved in the fire against the motorcade are not true. An attack on the motorcade from our military personnel is out of the question," a peacekeeping force spokesman said, according to Interfax. The news agency also quoted a senior South Ossetian official as saying that South Ossetia "has nothing to do" with the incident. "The Georgian side is once again disseminating misinformation," South Ossetian Deputy Defense Minister Ibragim Gasseyev told Interfax. Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders with those regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing.	1
Ten everyday people will be recognized Thursday for their remarkable efforts to make the world a better place. CNN's Anderson Cooper will reveal this year's top 10 CNN Heroes during the 8 a.m. hour of "New Day." All the top 10 Heroes were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. Each will receive $50,000 and be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs December 1. One of the top 10 will receive an additional $250,000 for their cause if the public chooses them as the CNN Hero of the Year. Starting Thursday morning, you will be able to vote for your favorite Hero at CNNHeroes.com or from your mobile device. Voting ends November 17. Last year's Hero of the Year was Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports children so they don't have to live behind bars with their incarcerated parents. She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life. "These children have done nothing wrong. They are simply caught in something they do not understand," Basnet said. "We want to work with the government to bring them all out of prison. And they deserve a better future." Robin Lim, the Hero of the Year in 2011, was recognized for helping thousands of poor Indonesians have a healthy pregnancy and birth. "I found that if you have a good idea and you do it with love, a lot of people want to help you," Lim said. This is the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. This year's tribute show will be held in New York and hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History.

July 22, 2011 Download a PDF map related to today's show: • Washington, D.C. Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. First Up: Hot Foods CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Carl Azuz, reporting from Washington, D.C. this week where -- get this -- it is actually hotter than it is 500 miles south in Atlanta, Georgia at CNN's world headquarters! The reason for the sizzlin' is a heat wave that's stretching over the eastern part of the U.S. caused by this high pressure weather system that's expanding across the country. We've got something for you today, though, that'll hopefully help you cool off. I'm joined by my CNN Newsource colleague Karen Caifa, who's going to talk to us about what to eat to stay cool on the inside while you seek shade on the outside. Right, Karen? KAREN CAIFA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, Carl. It's great to have you here, even though it's super hot here in Washington. And when the weather's like this, sometimes you don't really feel like eating. But a nutritionist tells me that it's actually really important that you do, because you want to replenish all the water that you're losing when you're out there sweating it out. (BEGIN VIDEO) CAIFA: When the weather is hot and sticky, the foods you love may not seem as appetizing. But you can help your body beat the heat by changing your grocery list. REBECCA SCRITCHFIELD, REGISTERED DIETITIAN: We need to be eating, and we need to be eating light meals, eating often, and we also want to make sure that we replace a lot of the water that we lose when we're sweating. CAIFA: To replace that water, registered dietitian Rebecca Scritchfield recommends stocking up on fruits and veggies, which are almost all water, and quite nutritious. SCRITCHFIELD: Some of the nutrients that you get in dairy foods, you can actually get in vegetables. For example, a lot of our leafy greens are a good source of calcium. CAIFA: Fill your cart with alternative sources of fat, instead of processed or, especially, fried foods.	1
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor, a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000. A former Alaskan lawmaker says it seems unlikely that Gov. Sarah Palin was unaware of Wasilla's policy. Former state Rep. Eric Croft, a Democrat, sponsored a state law requiring cities to provide the examinations free of charge to victims. He said the only ongoing resistance he met was from Wasilla, where Palin was mayor from 1996 to 2002. "It was one of those things everyone could agree on except Wasilla," Croft told CNN. "We couldn't convince the chief of police to stop charging them." Alaska's Legislature in 2000 banned the practice of charging women for rape exam kits -- which experts said could cost up to $1,000. Palin, the Republican nominee for vice president, often talks about her experience running Wasilla, population approximately 7,000, and that has prompted close scrutiny of her record there. Wasilla's practice of charging victims for their rape exams while she was mayor has gotten wide circulation on the Internet and in the mainstream media.  Watch CNN's Jessica Yellin check the facts in Wasilla » Some supporters of Palin say they believe she had no knowledge of the practice. But critics call it "outrageous" and question Palin's commitment to helping women who are the victims of violence. For years, Alaska has had the worst record of any state in rape and in murder of women by men. The rape rate in Alaska is 2.5 times the national average. Interviews and a review of records turned up no evidence that Palin knew that  rape victims were being charged in her town. But Croft, the former state representative who sponsored the law changing the practice, says it seems unlikely Palin was not aware of the issue. "I find it hard to believe that for six months a small town, a police chief, would lead the fight against a statewide piece of legislation receiving unanimous support and the mayor not know about it," Croft said. During the time Palin was mayor of Wasilla, her city was not the only one in Alaska charging rape victims. Experts testified before the Legislature that in a handful of small cities across Alaska, law enforcement agencies were charging victims or their insurance "more than sporadically."	1
China's status a business superpower is transferring to the sporting world -- and its golfing ambitions took another step towards the big leagues on Sunday. Organizers of the HSBC Champions tournament announced that it has been upgraded to a full U.S. PGA Tour event, and will become part of the schedule for the prestigious end-of-season FedEx Cup playoffs. The tournament, which is already one of the four World Golf Championship events played each year, will boost its prize fund from $7 million this year to $8.5 million. Next year it will return to the Sheshan International Golf Club in Shanghai, where it was held for from 2005-2011 before going to Mission Hills in Shenzen for this week's staging -- which was won by Englishman Ian Poulter on Sunday. "This is not so much a renewal as a rebirth -- it's a new dawn for HSBC Champions and for Asian golf which is now right at the top table of world golf," said Giles Morgan, head of sponsorship for the British multinational bank. "When we first came to China in 2005, our ambition was to create a world-class international golf tournament in an emerging market. Eight years on and the HSBC Champions, complete with full FedExCup points and an increased prize fund, is up there with the very best, and today's announcement represents a major step forward for golf in China. "Our involvement in golf at this elite level is underpinned by our continuing sponsorship of youth development and grassroots programs, including the HSBC China Junior Open." Chinese soccer clubs have recently been investing large amounts in foreign players and coaches, but golf has been steadily developing in the country for the past decade -- especially with the sport returning to the Olympics in 2016. "We hope the event will continue to play an important role to help grow the game of golf and improve the competition level of China," said General Zhang Xiaoning, executive vice-president and secretary of the country's golf association. China's development is already showing, with 14-year-old Guan Tian-Lang poised to make more history next year when he becomes the youngest player to start at the prestigious Masters Tournament in April. He qualified by winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship on Sunday, having already been the youngest player to line up at a European Tour event at this year's China Open.	1
Kang Min Kyu, 52, taught ethics. Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry. Just two days after the accident, he was found dead after apparently hanging himself using a belt from a tree in the city of Jindo. In a note, he expressed regret he had survived while so many others had died. On a chilly Monday, around 4:30 a.m., Kang's coffin was led out of a funeral hall in a long, black hearse. It was too early for any sunlight. There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot. No one spoke. His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse. When they reached the end of the parking lot of the funeral home, they got into the car. The whole walk took less than five minutes before the mourners got in and drove in a line of cars headed to the crematorium. Kang's body had been found Friday in one of the small mountains near the Jindo Gymnasium where bereaved families are taking shelter, according to local police. He had gone to Jindo with the school in an effort to support families, said one fellow educator. "As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media. When some familes directed their anger at him, he became "brokenhearted." Over 300 students from the school and their teachers were aboard the ferry. Some are confirmed dead and and hope is dwindling that any more survivors will be found. 174 were rescued. Hundreds remain missing. Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind. He wrote that it was his idea for the field trip and that the deaths of the students were his fault. He said he could not live not knowing where his students are. He also wrote that he wonders whether he could still be their teacher on the other side, in death. Families protest over rescue operation The note also expressed a request to be cremated and his ashes scattered where the Sewol had sank. In Korean funerals, there are no ceremonies or eulogies -- they are a quiet, private affair.	1
The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water. The aid requested is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake this year -- but twice as many Pakistanis are in dire need of help. The money poured in for survivors of Haiti's quake, but the funds are only slowly trickling in for people left homeless or ill in the wake of widespread flooding in the South Asian nation. Is it because the earthquake was such a sudden shock, destroying huge chunks of cities and villages within a matter of 35 horrifying seconds while Pakistan's floods evolved over three weeks? That's part of the reason, said Alex Wynter of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. "Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people," Wynter said. "However, this is a totally exceptional flood. I have seen quite a number of floods in my time, but never anything remotely approaching this scale." Much also depends on media coverage and the images that permeate television and computer screens. In Haiti, pictures of the collapsed presidential palace and vast tent cities tugged at hearts. "It's very hard to compare disasters," said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). "Haiti was instant, extremely visual. There was an outpouring of sympathy. Pakistan has been a slowly evolving disaster." Though it is far from truth, the suffering in Pakistan appears more muted than when dump trucks carried thousands of crushed bodies to mass graves outside the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake. The flooding in Pakistan has been of epic proportions: 20 million people affected; more than 1,400 dead; 900,000 homes damaged; 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases. More people have been affected than in the 2004 South Asia tsunami, the 2005 South Asia earthquake, and the Haiti earthquake combined. But the enormous scale of Pakistan's tragedy has been hard to grasp. The death toll has not been nearly as high as it was in those previous disasters. Ironically, that may be a reason why aid has been slow to come in.	1
At least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh, police and fire officials told CNN. Many of those injured were in critical ileitis, a kind of intestinal inflammation that often causes life-threatening bleeding.The factory was under construction near the village of Rangpur when it collapsed, officials said. "It was a major accident," said A.K. Moshtaque, the chief engineer of the police.Mushtaque told CNN that the factory was under construction, and that officials were investigating its collapse.The factory was a major source of power and cement for Bangladesh, and it was the first large construction project to be completed in the country in decades.Local health officials said the people killed were not workers. Three persons, including the factory's chief engineer, were killed earlier, he said. Bangladesh's construction minister said the factory collapsed due to heavy rains.A video distributed by the police and fire departments showed flames shooting up from the site as more than 60 people were injured.Video posted on social media showed the factory's collapsed roof. In the video, the chief engineer's voice could be heard saying: "Please save us, please save us." Fire department workers stood on the roof. The chief engineer was said to be in a state of shock, and was reportedly undergoing treatment."I heard the noise of the fire and immediately went there," said Shah Alam, a resident of the village near Rangpur.Rangpur, the capital of Bangladesh's Rangpur region, is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Dhaka.Bangladesh is a predominantly Bengali Muslim country, and the country's Hindu majority is relatively small. Ethnic tensions are common, and the government has struggled to tackle them, while millions of Muslims make up a large minority.As a result, religious minorities often complain about abuses from both Christians and Muslims.In Bangladesh, there has been a spate of recent violence between religious groups. In October 2017, hundreds of Muslims attacked a church and burned it to the ground. The following year, about 1,700 people took part in anti-Christian protests after a video was released showing a Muslim man beating a Christian man who was wearing a cross.In November 2017, anti-Muslim protests also led to the	0
Ashlee Tomsche walked into the rec center with trepidation. Images of six-pack abs and neon sports bras from the Zumba infomercials she had watched flashed through her mind. I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought. With her head down, she walked into the aerobics room and took a spot in the back. She was 21 and weighed 331 pounds. Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class that blends booty shaking with international music and an intense calorie burn. Since the company launched in 2001, Zumba classes have spread to 14 million people in 150 countries, according to Zumba.com. Tomsche's first class was hard. She had to stop several times to catch her breath. But she came back the next day. And then again the next. A year later, she had dropped 123 pounds, six dress sizes and more than 10 inches from her waist. "It's just crazy," the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says. "We're having too much fun." Comfort food Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds. "It really hit me hard, and I turned to food for comfort," she remembers. "It was always there." She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon. She would eat an entire pizza by herself in one sitting. Every time she binged on junk food, she felt sick and swore she'd never do it again. But overeating had already taken its toll. She didn't go out because she wasn't confident in her body. Instead she came home right after work to snack in front of the TV. Once in a while she would hit the gym to walk on the treadmill, but it bored her more than empowering her. "I knew I needed to lose weight, but I never knew where to start," she says. "I would try something for a few months and give up." Then she found Zumba. Just dance Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class. Tomsche wore baggy clothing and seemed unsure in her body. "She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says. "But she would get right back up and continue to do what she could."	1
Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has spoken of his relief at finally making public the fact he is gay -- and now wants to become a role model for gay people in sport. Speaking to British news channel ITN, Thomas revealed why it has taken him so long to speak openly about his sexuality. "Every gay man will tell you that 'coming out' is like a weight lifted from your shoulders and beng able to walk down the street knowing that there is nothing for me to hide has been a liberating experience, " admitted Thomas -- the most capped player in Wales history with 100 appearances for his country. "I knew I was gay at 18, but to come out then would have meant I would not have achieved what I did in rugby. I loved rugby so much and it was so important to me that I made the decision to keep my sexuality secret. People may disagree with that, but it was my belief and my decision. "Since my announcement I have had an amazing response and have not had one negative comment or any abuse. I think it proves there is a place for gay men in every walk of life. "Gay men are accepted in films, music and politics because people came out and broke the mould and stereotype in those industries. "What I am trying to do is break the trend in rugby and sport in general and show any aspiring sportsman, regardless of his age, that the mould has been broken. "It is not an issue if a straight man plays rugby -- and I hope my decision will ensure it is not an issue if a gay man plays rugby."	1
Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been charged with improper conduct by the English Football Association. The former national team captain responded to a tweet describing Chelsea and  Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas as a "good all-rounder". He has also been charged for comments made towards Ferdinand's brother, Gary, who has played for United since 2008. Ferdinand had told the British media he was "happy where he was born and raised" and not a "spoilt, spoilt brat". Ferdinand has been fined £5,000 for the misconduct charge, and £5,000 for the comment, and is banned from the FA until 2 December for the misconduct charge, and is banned from the FA until 2 December for the comment. Ferdinand also has to pay a £20,000 image transfer fee to the FA and the club's legal costs. Ferdinand is due in court on 26 December to defend the charge.Fabregas and Ferdinand's comments during Sunday's draw at Chelsea.Fabregas is described in many newspapers as a good all-rounderFerdinand, who has played every minute of every match of his career, joined Chelsea from Real Madrid for £19m in 2008, and has never scored in his first five seasons at Stamford Bridge. United's first-choice central defender Rio Ferdinand is charged with misconduct by the English Football Association for "poor performance". Ferdinand reportedly had an argument with Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen in the Chelsea goal mouth which led to a foul. Ferdinand's brother Gary was also sent off against United.Comments were made by United's Rio Ferdinand about Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas at Chelsea's visit to Old Trafford on Sunday.At the time, Ferdinand was not a member of the England squad with Paul Scholes, who replaced him, but United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was at the game and Ferguson said that Ferdinand will be available as a substitute for England should the player be fit. When Manchester United play Chelsea, the club's players wear special red shirts and Chelsea, in a different shade of red, have black shirts. Ferdinand said Fabregas is a good all-rounder, who is not afraid of playing in these special shirts. At the time, Chelsea was playing a new black and red home kit. Ferdinand responded to the comments saying he supports Chelsea and has no problem with Fabregas.Ferdinand was fined £300,000 and three months' wages, and was later suspended for two matches.	0
Alex Karras, the burly defensive lineman turned actor in the ABC sitcom "Webster," died Wednesday surrounded by his family in their Los Angeles home following a hard-fought battle with kidney disease, heart disease, dementia  and other ailments. He was 74."He'll be remembered as an extraordinary man and a wonderful, caring, creative human being," said his son Kyle Karras of the family's Hollywood Hills home. "A hero who was a loving husband, father, son to his family and his brother to his fans."As he accepted his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Monday, the actor paused to light a cigarette and take a drag while signing the star."He was very proud of the role he got to do in a TV show he had so much fun with, in a role he absolutely loved being in," his eldest son Mark Karras said. "He had so many other things he was so proud of, but he was proud of what he got to do."At the ceremony, Karras shook the hand of another "Webster" star -- the late actor William Peterson, who played Webster's archrival George Wallace in the show's first two seasons. The actor was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2004 and died in 2014.Webster was one of several hits for ABC, which went as far as to take the top billing of its opening broadcast in the Nielsen ratings.That was followed by a short-lived sitcom about a family of retirees living in Lake Tahoe called "Saved by the Bell" and later "The Andy Griffith Show."After a couple of successful appearances on "Two and a Half Men," Karras -- his first and last on television -- eventually became a star in the small screen with a role on "The Office" and other series, including "30 Rock," "How I Met Your Mother" and the ABC legal drama "Bored to Death" and "Terrace House" on Fox.Karras was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in the 2009 movie "All the Real Girls," which was followed by another Golden Globe for "American Horror Story: Coven" in 2013.The actor had been diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2006 and was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 2016. He was hospitalized for a brain aneurysm in 2015."The K	0
The federal agency that protects the nation's borders is doing a shoddy job protecting the nation's wallet, abusing an overtime fund to the tune of $8.7 million annually, according to a government watchdog. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that receives whistleblower complaints, said offices within Customs and Border Protection and elsewhere within the Department of Homeland Security engage in a "gross waste of government funds." Overtime money intended for special circumstances was routinely given to employees who frequently spent that time watching sports and entertainment channels, Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner wrote in a letter to the White House. Employees working in CBP's "Situation Room" received overtime 89 percent of the time, Lerner said. "This case is not an isolated occurrence. Rather, it is part of a persistent pattern of AUO [Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime] allegations raised by DHS employees," Lerner wrote. The problem was brought to light, the OSC said, by several CBP employees who were authorized to receive the overtime pay but were troubled by the ethics of the practice and its impact on the federal budget. The DHS said in a statement that Acting Secretary Rand Beers had requested a "comprehensive, department-wide review of the use of (administrative overtime)." "DHS takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds," spokesman Peter Boogaard said. DHS made a similar promise after allegations of overtime abuse surfaced in 2008, the Special Counsel said. In February of that year, a whistleblower alleged abuses at the Office of Border Patrol in Lynden, Washington. After a department report confirmed that employees abused overtime and that senior managers benefited from improperly approved overtime, the agency promised to implement "an Agency-wide AUO policy directive" to prevent misuse throughout the agency. "That commitment was made more than five years ago," Lerner wrote in her letter to the White House. "The lack of progress in implementing plans first outlined five years ago raises questions about the agency's willingness or ability to confront this important problem." The use of administrative overtime "functionally [extended] their daily shift by two hours each day, but are not the result of any unpredictable or compelling law enforcement need," Lerner wrote. Lerner wrote that DHS must curb the abuse and, if warranted, revise the pay system to ensure fair pay for employees who are legitimately working overtime.	1
Former NFL lineman Shane Dronett's transformation from an affable prankster, quick to flash a wry smile, to a person who was often frightened -- and frightening -- was subtle at first. It began in 2006, with a bad dream. "He woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming and told everyone to run out of the house," said Chris Dronett, Shane Dronett's wife. "He thought that someone was blowing up our house. It was very frightening." Chris tried to dismiss the incident as isolated, except that two weeks later, there was another outburst, then another, until they were an almost-nightly occurrence. And as Shane's fear and paranoia began overwhelming him, so did episodes of confusion and rage that sometimes turned violent. Only three years after retiring from the NFL in 2006, Shane was suffering. The tragic culmination of his pain came when he committed suicide in 2009 at 38. Scientists at the Boston University School of Medicine's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy tested Shane's brain tissue and confirmed that  before he died he was suffering with a brain disease -- chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- that seems to afflict football players. "There is evidence of CTE in his brain making him yet another former NFL player who had definite CTE," said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the traumatic encephalopathy center. Nowinski said the center has found evidence of CTE in the brains of 13 of 14 former NFL players, including Dronett. Usually found in much older dementia patients, CTE is an accumulation of an abnormal protein in the brain called tau, which is associated with repeated head traumas -- concussions or subconcussive hits -- that are not allowed to heal. CTE can also diminish brain tissue and is associated with memory loss, depression, impulsive behavior and rage. Outrage comes out of nowhere The Dronetts' daughter recalled an incident at a local burger joint: "He was ordering, and he got mad at (an employee) and just punched him in the face," said 16-year-old Hayley Dronett. "He thought the guy was shaking the ice weird or something, and he took him down in the restaurant," added Chris.	1
Forget everything you know about what's making us fat. We hear a lot about Americans being fast food-addicted couch potatoes, and while that does play a role in the nation's expanding waist lines, a new study concludes it's not the driving force behind the obesity epidemic. Instead all Americans -- no matter what income level they have and no matter what neighborhood they live in -- are getting bigger because food is cheaper than ever before, the study authors say. Simply put, we're spending less of our total budget on food so we're buying more. The study, published in the June edition of the journal CA Cancer, found that people in 1930 spent about a fourth of their disposable income on food. Today food takes up about a tenth of our disposable income. Food is also easier to prepare and easier to purchase than it was in 1930. That means Americans aren't just eating more high-calorie food, they are eating more of a variety of foods. Consequently, Americans have consumed, on average, about 20% more calories since the 1970s. Lead study authors Roland Sturm and An Ruopeng hope it will lay to rest some myths about obesity. He lost 125 pounds, but still felt fat "If you look at the data over time, you actually see a slight increase in exercise. And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables," said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation. "It's not Southern hospitality that is driving this trend, nor is it income or education. Really nothing protects us from this challenge of obesity." On average, Americans have been getting fatter since at least the 1950s, maybe even longer. While the data isn't perfect, experts looking at health records for men between the ages of 40 and 49 see a steady increase in body mass index since 1900. Obesity isn't only a problem for people who want to wear bikinis to the beach. Excess body fat can raise a person's risk for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and chronic illnesses. "What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives," said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society.	1
The North Korean government informed the State Department on Friday that it is holding a second American citizen who the  North considers an American spy.U.S. officials said that they could not identify the second captive, but that he or she had been identified by North Korean officials.The Americans were arrested in late May by a North Korean team of about 10 agents who went to the United States and presented a fake diplomatic passport, which officials say could only be used to enter either North Korea or China.The captives were given into the custody of the U.S. government on Friday, and will be held until their trial.“I am working on it,” Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday in a telephone interview. He said that the State Department’s legal department has been in contact with North Koreans to try to secure their release.Under North Korean law, the person’s identity must remain secret for the rest of their lives.“I want to make sure that we know the name of the person and ensure his or her full safety,” Kerry said.Pentagon officials said the U.S. may not be able to release the individual without first informing the North Korean government of the name of the person. However, the Pentagon’s Defense Attaché in Pyongyang had not yet notified the North Korean government of the name.Officials said that the person remains at a secret location outside the United States, and only a small number of people, including a few highly trusted North Korean officials and diplomats and about 20 others, were allowed to visit him in secret.A U.S. official said the person is believed to be a U.S. citizen. That person may have used a diplomatic passport that was issued under a different name, but the new passport still had the same name and the name of the person who is now in custody.The official said that after the first American was arrested, his mother contacted the U.S. State Department and expressed concern about the safety of her son. She reached out to the State Department on behalf of her son, the official said.The North Korean government released a different American captive two days before the second captive was captured and presented to the U.S. government, officials said. The two Americans were described as a man and a woman in their early to mid-30s.	0
Football's world governing body FIFA has provisionally suspended outgoing Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer for 90 days "based on the fact that various breaches of the Code of Ethics appear to have been committed" by the American. The former general secretary of CONCACAF, the body which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, has been barred from taking part in "any kind of football-related activity" for a maximum period of 90 days. The decision was taken by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- which opened investigation proceedings against Blazer, 68, in response to a report filed by the CONCACAF Integrity Committee last month. "The decision was taken following a request made by the acting deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, Robert Torres, based on the fact that various breaches of the FIFA Code of Ethics appear to have been committed by Chuck Blazer and that a decision on the main issue could not be taken early enough," read a Fifa statement. The announcement comes less than one week after fellow FIFA executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando of Sri Lanka was banned for eight years for unethical behaviour. The CONCACAF report alleged that Blazer, who has been provisionally banned pending a full disciplinary hearing, received at least $15 million in addition to other funds that were used to buy and rent luxury apartments. Blazer, who has been the most senior American official at FIFA for the last 16 years, had previously said that he will give up his seat on the Executive Committee when his term expires at the end of this month. He resigned as CONCACAF's general secretary in 2011, after serving with the body for 21 years. In April, the head of CONCACAF's integrity committee, David Simmons, described Blazer and his former boss, Trinidadian Jack Warner, as being 'fraudulent in their management' of the continental organization. The former colleagues fell out in 2011 when Blazer reported Warner and Asian Football Confederation chief Mohamed bin Hammam to FIFA's Ethics Committee, accusing the duo of trying to bribe Caribbean delegated to support the Qatari bin Hammam in that year's FIFA presidential election. Blazer's accusations led to the downfall of bin Hammam, the resignation of Warner as a FIFA vice president and CONCACAF leader, and sanctions against several Caribbean football officials. Now however, Blazer finds himself in the dock alongside Warner.	1
What happens to the 3,100 students who enrolled in fake classes and now have a degree stamped with the seal of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill -- an institution consistently ranked among the nation's top public schools? Likely nothing. The school's president is talking about it with The New York Times:The university has now made public all of its records on the matter, in a filing to the federal government with the National Science Foundation."Our main concern has been the integrity and reputation of the university," Mr. Hovis said in the filing. "We've worked very hard to have as clear a picture as possible and hope this will help provide clarity to the community." "Clearly, [the] university has taken a serious public health and safety issue and turned it into a PR liability," said Eric Pianin, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. "Every school or organization that does that, whether it's an environmental group or a social justice group or an activist movement, is putting the public through a trauma and it is really unfair."While "a serious public health and safety issue" it is a felony to defraud the US government in their representation of the education industry.A:This is probably a case of "too much information" -- but here are two answers to this question, the first from the University of North Carolina itself:At no time did we offer or attempt to offer a degree from UNC, nor did we provide any of the information required in the federal form.  To the contrary, the federal forms are often filled out in the worst of times, with paper or digital documents, and then returned to us by mail to the last known address.  We are working with the federal government to investigate this matter fully.andUNC's investigation revealed that the original documents submitted to the federal government were indeed valid and in strict compliance with the requirements.  In addition, the University maintains that the students in question were enrolled in a class that met the requirements of federal regulations.You're probably going to have to do a little more searching to find more information about this, but in the meantime, at least the University of North Carolina has given an explanation.I suspect the problem will have to do with the degree being invalid because the student never completed the coursework.A:I just received a call from the School	0
Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain told supporters Saturday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, which has become hobbled in recent weeks by allegations of sexual harassment and an Atlanta woman's claim that  he groped her after a 2005 debate  .  The statement on Cain's Web site comes less than a day after a woman told The New York Times that he made unwelcome sexual advances in a hotel room while she was a research assistant.  Cain's campaign manager says the decision to suspend the campaign is his.  "I'm not sure I have the strength to do it, but I think the need for the public to know the truth is greater than the need for him to keep his campaign alive," Cain spokesman Mark Block wrote in an e-mail sent Saturday night.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Global NewsINTERNATIONALThe Next American - Asian Crisis?11/16/2001The World-HeraldAsia / Taiwan / Hong Kong / Japan / South America / U.S.A. / Africa(Copyright 2001 by The World-Herald Publications (Hong Kong))There are signs the current crisis in the United States and in Asia is being felt more intensely in the latter half of the world than the former. The United States seems to be on the verge of electing a president who will not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country or who will not want to help it to establish a democratic government, according to sources in the political, business, and media establishments. The same is true of Japan, where the country's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is more anxious than his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, to re-establish relations with China. Such attitudes reflect a growing global awareness that the current U.S.-China standoff, which has already drawn in the world's biggest economies and has the government behind it, may not be resolved satisfactorily. The Bush administration has been trying to get Beijing to rein in its Taiwan-Taiwanese-Chinese Taipei-Communist China group, which has been flexing its muscles in a bid to achieve its core national interest. Beijing is trying to convince Washington that China should be rewarded for supporting its position. Japan, meanwhile, is under the influence of a powerful lobby of retired senior Japanese officials from the past two administrations - the Abe Cabinet	0
Sheriff's investigators Thursday asked prosecutors to charge Justin Bieber with felony vandalism in his alleged egging of a neighbor's home. "No decision will be  made in this matter until the investigation into the recent vandalism of a neighbor is complete," the Clark County District Attorney's Office said in a statement."This is a felony offense that could result in substantial jail time," the statement said.The investigation began when the neighbor woke up on Monday to find Bieber's egg on the wall of his home. Police were called and found the egg and damage done to the fence.Investigators said they asked the district attorney's office to pursue charges and are seeking additional information beyond the initial complaint so that the case could be presented to the grand jury.Biebie had been arrested and booked into an Idaho jail Thursday on suspicion of assault. He is due in court Friday morning.I can see if this was a crime of passion. Why would he want to destroy the house of his neighbors that he doesn't even know, but he still wants to destroy their property? He will pay for it, I am sure. However, it may not even be that bad. I know that this is horrible, but he doesn't know me well. He thought that he knew me and he was very wrong. He thought that I was a nice person with a respectable family. I wish him the best.Why would he want to destroy the house of his neighbors that he doesn't even know, but he still wants to destroy their property?Because that is what he was doing and he had no respect for them or their property.Justin is a douchebag, but not a bad person. He did something that he regretted in the most recent Justin vs. JB interview, he should have reported the vandalism he witnessed to the police, but I can't say that he has any regrets about this.Just look at his Twitter feed and read some of the comments by his fans.Aww poor Justin, he has all this money and people love him but he is so immature and spoiled...I hope they take him to a good jail and beat the shit out of him with metal pipes and other shit.Just look at his Twitter feed and read some of the comments by his fans.Aww poor Justin, he has all this money and people love him but he is so immature and spoiled...	0
Jakarta has always had a rich and fruitful relationship with the sea. A trade gateway linking east and west, the modern city can still show travelers glimpses of its long maritime history. Now the Indonesian capital, it was initially settled as the port of Sunda Kelapa by the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda around the fifth century and was designed to develop a vibrant sea trade for the realm. The "coconut of Sunda" (the port's name translated from Sundanese) soon flourished and attracted the attention of other maritime-invested nations including the Portuguese, Dutch and British. To this day, you can still see the influence of the Dutch colonialists in the architecture of many of the buildings in the old city. Today, Indonesia is an independent republic that has become a melting pot of cultures and people. Nicknamed by travelers as the "Big Durian" (a pungent-smelling but sweet-tasting local fruit), the modern metropolis of Jakarta is a swelteringly smoggy city bursting at the seams with people. Watch: Jakarta's maritime history Its moniker is probably a good description of the city. It may not be everyone's idea of a typical vacation spot -- some portions of the city are grungy, dilapidated streets with scruffy slums. But underneath the seemingly overpopulated, polluted exterior lies a vibrant city rich in history and eclectic tourism options. Here are our top picks for tourists wanting to sample Jakarta's maritime heritage. Often missed by vacationers, the historic harbor of Sunda Kelapa sits at the mouth of the Ciliwung River. The original settlement is a fantastic insight into the city's history and is home to what is said to be the world's last wind-powered seafaring trade fleet. Walk amongst the traditional pinisi ships -- simple but sturdy wooden vessels -- that once provided trade from Indonesia to Europe and Africa. Climb up Syahbandar Tower and gaze upon the beautiful views from the top. Literally meaning "Fish Market" in Bahasa Indonesia (the country's native tongue), Pasar Ikan sits at the end of Sunda Kelapa harbor. Although the market now sells all types of wares, Indonesian fishermen still gather here daily to sell their catch. The best time to visit and join locals purchasing the best goods is in the morning before it gets too hot and the smell of fish becomes overwhelming. In numbers: The world's shipping industry	1
Thanks to a wave of new mobile technology, I can store my calendar, car keys, credit cards, music and notes all on my smartphone. That kind of convergence is convenient, but my phone has an Achilles' heel. The battery doesn't last forever. Enter the Powerbag, a line of battery-equipped shoulder bags and backpacks made by RFA Brands. It's a smart backup for when gadgets inevitably need to take naps. I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar. On several instances during my tests, the bag proved useful on long trips or when traveling to conferences where I'm constantly making calls or doing e-mail. I had to overcome a couple of concerns before strapping on the Powerbag. For one, the idea of carrying a battery about the size of a deck of cards on my back in the rain is not comforting. And this line in the Powerbag manual's lengthy "warnings" section is not exactly reassuring: "Improper use of this product may result in product damage, excess heat, toxic fumes, fire or explosion." "Powerbag sources the highest quality cells and parts for the batteries," a Ful spokesman wrote in a reply to my worried e-mail. "Our batteries are all rigorously and thoroughly tested, enduring the most abusive of treatment, still upholding Powerbag's high standard of safety." When I considered that I keep my phone in my pocket near vital organs, the fear seemed less rational. The battery is stored in a zippered pocket at the bottom of the bag. I wouldn't take the bag on a whitewater canoe trip or a daylong hike under the blistering Egyptian sun, but the rain didn't faze it. My other hangup involved the annoyance of having one more thing to keep charged. I already charge my smartphone, tablet, laptop, iPod, computer mouse and Bluetooth headset. Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too? However, I was pleasantly surprised by how long the Powerbag's battery lasts. It went for more than a week at a time retaining most of its charge. On a single charge, it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and iPod, for example.	1
This one was big but it's not the Big One. An 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile Tuesday night, triggering small landslides, setting off a tsunami and killing at least five people. But geologists say an even larger quake in the region is lurking. "This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California. "We're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake." It could be tomorrow. Or it could be 50 years. "We do not know when it's going to occur," he said. Here's why: Chile sits on an arc of volcanos and fault lines circling the Pacific Ocean known as the "Ring of Fire." This area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The country itself has seen no shortage of seismic activity in recent years. Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above. Powerful earthquake strikes off Chile, triggers tsunami In 2010, about 500 people died when an 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit. That quake was so violent, it moved one whole city about 10 feet west. Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years. In recent weeks, this area has seen a cluster of activity-- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes. Then, late last month, a 6.7 and a 6.1 magnitude quake struck. When quakes happen, the surface ruptures. The two sides of the fault slip past each other. But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake "did not rupture in this event," Simons said. And it's "still an area that hasn't ruptured in 140-odd years." Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time. "We expect another 8.8-8.9 earthquake here sometime in the future," Simons said. The good news? "It may not occur for many, many years."

Are you still shopping for holiday gifts? Then stop right now. Don't buy another present before you read this. I want to save you from making the biggest holiday gift-giving mistake of your life. Look, we've all heard the clichÃ© gift adage: "It's the thought that counts." But sometimes you truly have to wonder: What the hell was the person thinking when they bought the gift? Did the person just close his or her eyes and buy the first thing they touched? Or maybe they were drunk while shopping? Regardless of the reason, there are too many good people getting bad gifts. This isn't about being ungrateful. It's about being honest. We have all received gifts that require us to fake a smile as our eyes dart around desperately hoping to locate the receipt. I'm not alone in feeling this way. Earlier this week, I posted a simple question on Twitter and Facebook: Have you ever received a bad holiday gift? The responses were off the charts. Christmas, Hanukah, Eid, etc. -- it didn't matter, you pick the holiday and I can list you a bunch of bad gifts. So, I humbly offer to be your gift-giving guide --sort of like the ghost in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." And in keeping with that classic holiday tale, we will start by looking at holidays past in the hopes that you won't replicate the gift-giving catastrophes of bygone days. 1. Don't give gifts that imply the recipient is fat or needs to improve his or her looks This came up numerous times. People thought they were being helpful by surprising their friend or loved one with a gift certificate for a weight loss program like Jenny Craig or for a personal trainer. The most astounding gift was a voucher for a Botox treatment given to Hanadi Kalla -- she was 26 years old at the time. Only give these types of gifts if discussed in advance or prepare yourself for the consequences. 2. Overly practical gifts These were typically given by husbands or boyfriends to their wives or girlfriends. Here are a few of the gems: an ice scraper for the car, a battery organizer, Pyrex dishes, and my favorite was this gift to Beth Richardson: A replacement car antenna -- yes, installation was included. These gifts are fine if a person asks for it. But barring a specific request: No electric can openers as holiday gifts. 3. Re-gifting nightmares	1
A powerful storm system that ripped through the Louisville, Kentucky, area left thousands of people without power and forced the closing of the internationally famous Churchill Downs racetrack on Thursday. The National Weather Service said Ã¢â‚¬Å“at least half of the stormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s damage has been done to homes, businesses and structures,Ã¢â‚¬Â while the total number of storm-related incidents was still unclear.We’ll bring you the latest developments as they’re released and our thoughts on what it all means for Louisville, the region, the city and the horse industry.THE BIG STORM UPDATEThe storm system that swept through the region from Kentucky to Indiana and New Jersey on Thursday night began on the west side of the U.S. East Coast around midnight and continued from the Gulf of Mexico into the southeast. The storm system is being called a supercell, and forecasters are calling it the fourth of the kind that has made the United States so vulnerable to extreme weather.The storm system is being characterized as a “supercell” of the type that makes the nation as a whole feel vulnerable to a major threat. The National Weather Service says that it was the biggest storm to hit the Louisville, Kentucky, area since Tropical Storm Isabel made landfall in 2006. More than 60,000 customers lost power.The Weather Service said people without power should expect to have to wait two to three hours before they can turn it back on. Schools and businesses are closed Thursday.The Weather Service issued a travel alert for the Kentucky Valley and the area between Louisville and Cincinnati, Ohio. The NWS expects heavy rainfall and strong winds to affect the region through Friday.As of 6 a.m. Friday, forecasters said the storm will be over the Ohio and Kentucky states.Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had this to say:“The mayor strongly supports our local emergency management officials in Louisville and the community efforts to recover from this storm. However, this is really unprecedented for Louisville. We feel very fortunate in so many ways that this has not been our first storm. We are prepared. If anyone needs more information about how to prepare for any storm, we encourage you to contact your local emergency management officials.”Numerous schools, including Louisville’s	0
President Barack Obama strongly condemned what he called a "cowardly, evil" terror attack in Paris on Wednesday that claimed 12 lives and praised France for standing "shoulder to shoulder" in the fight against terrorism. Obama said Wednesday that he ia speech to the nation in which he "strongly" condemned the bloodshed in the French capital.“As you know, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and with the people of France,” Obama said.“Let us be clear: At a very fundamental level, this was an act of terror and heartless murder intended to strike fear into the hearts of the French people,” he added. “As the world knows, there are moments in time when people of courage and purpose sacrifice much to protect others. These attacks are part of a wider campaign of violence and terrorism, including against Muslims and against innocent civilians.”After the killings Wednesday, Obama’s tone shifted from the solemn to the more personal. Speaking to reporters, he added: “I want to address the families of some of those who were killed.”“So many of the people killed that were innocent had done no harm to anyone,” he continued. “They were good people and they were exercising their freedom to worship.” Obama said he was sorry they died.“We’ve seen these kinds of attacks before. And the French people and the French people’s government always rise to the challenge. And so we stand shoulder to shoulder with them,” he said.In his statement, Obama called on the world to stand against the bloodshed.Obama addressed Obama's statement to the nation:President Obama’s speech Tuesday, which was originally scheduled to be delivered as a video address to the nation, was instead released in this format through White House press secretary Jay Carney, a rare step back from the traditional format of television speeches, though Obama still spoke to the nation.He began by addressing the attack Wednesday and added that he offered his condolences to those killed in the attack, and those wounded.He then went on to address his concerns about the ongoing threats from Islamic State militants and their allies elsewhere in the world.“Our efforts against ISIS and its associated forces and backers have intensified and will continue to intensify,” he said. �	0
A U.S. Marine was being held Monday on a warship after the slaying of a transgender woman in the Philippines. Because no charges have yet been filed, officials have not identified the Marine, who is assigned to 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. "The Marine Corps is working closely and cooperating fully with the Philippine National Police to ensure a thorough investigation is completed and due process of law is followed," Col. Brad Bartelt, spokesman with the U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said in a statement. A State Department spokesperson identified the deceased as Jeffrey Laude, also known as Jennifer. Her body, which showed signs of strangulation, was found shortly before midnight Saturday, according to Marine Corps Times. Three other Marines from the same unit as the Marine being detained have been identified as potential witnesses, the newspaper reported, citing an internal Navy memo on the incident. They are also being held.	1
Combining healthy eating with moral support, Jean Nidetch became a heavyweight in the weight-loss industry. The founder of Weight Watchers died Wednesday at her home in Florida. She was 91. What would become Weight Watchers started as a group of friends meeting in her Queens, New York, living room in 1961. Nidetch described herself as an "overweight housewife obsessed with cookies." After countless fad diets, Nidetch figured that accountability was the key to keeping the weight off.  At the time, she was 38 years old and weighed more than 200 pounds. Her guiding philosophy: "It's choice -- not chance -- that determines your destiny." Through the program of regular weigh-ins, peer support and accountability, not only did Nidetch lose 72 pounds, but she inspired millions more to shed pounds too. She officially launched Weight Watchers in 1963 and took the company public five years later. "Jean was an inspiration and an innovator who leaves behind a legacy and program that has positively impacted the health and well-being of millions of people around the world," said Jim Chambers, president and CEO Weight Watchers International. "It is our honor and responsibility to carry on her legacy to help more people to transform their lives."	1
No one can accuse China of stinting in its efforts to reach for the sky. Less than a year after construction was halted on a world-beating 838-meter tower in Changsa in central China (just days after it began) architects have revealed plans to build something even bigger. At one kilometer (0.6 miles) high, the largest of the two Phoenix Towers planned for Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, will be the tallest in the world if completed on schedule in 2017/2018. The towers will also be crazily futuristic and super environmentally friendly. And pink "Yes, [they are pink]," Laurie Chetwood of UK-based design firm Chetwoods Architects tells CNN. "They reflect the spectacular colors of the sunsets in the region." Designed to sit on an island in a lake, the largest of the towers will stand 172 meters (564 feet) taller than Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The project is still awaiting government final approval, but if all goes to plan it could steal a march on the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which is also designed to top out at one kilometer, but not until 2019. With a 2012 population of 9.7 million, Wuhan is located on the Yangtze River. It's a major transportation hub that's been called "the Chicago of China." Biggest kaleidoscope and floating restaurants "[We were asked] to create an iconic building for Wuhan, which embodied a strong environmental and social content as well as reflecting Chinese tradition," says Chetwood. The design is inspired by dualism in Chinese culture -- the traditional Chinese phoenix symbol of the two birds, "Feng" and "Huang," as well as the idea of yin and yang. Feng Huang, or phoenix, are a pair of mythical birds in Chinese culture traditionally used to denote royalty. Three large spheres containing celestial-themed restaurants accessible via "skywalks" will be suspended between the two towers. The spheres "represent planets orbiting the Towers," according to the designers. If giant pink towers and celestial spheres aren't gaudy enough, the larger building will have the unlikely boast of housing the world's tallest kaleidoscope driven by a wind turbine. It'll project a psychedelic display for people gazing up from below.	1
Smoking in youth-rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by Hollywood studios to encourage producers to show less "gratuitous smoking," according to an anti-smoking group. The American Medical Association Alliance has been recommending movies such as "The Blair Witch Project," "Dazed and Confused" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for years."It's been a long battle. We're going to continue fighting the tobacco industry; that's what we're doing," said Peter Sacco, spokesman for the American Medical Association. "We want to reduce smoking in movies, in television shows. We want to show that it's really harmless."Smoking has become an increasingly popular way of escaping the confines of home, from an old-fashioned, tobacco-filled cigarette to the new electronic cigarettes which are also popping up.But the AMA wants to get in the way.The group has long been concerned about whether tobacco companies are influencing movies, and this year gave its official stamp of approval to a new campaign by the National Cancer Institute on an educational website called Smoking: What We Know and What We Don't.AdvertisementThe AMA, at the center of an ongoing battle with cigarette companies, is worried that the National Cancer Institute is encouraging people to buy their cigarettes in tobacco stores rather than to quit smoking, says the AMA's Sacco, since many smokers are not aware they have quit smoking, and thus don't bother to purchase tobacco products."Their only goal is to raise awareness," Sacco said. "We want to create a strong public health movement that makes sure people know that tobacco smoking is really harmful."In an e-mail seeking comment on the AMA's recommendation on movies to show less smoking, the National Cancer Institute said the AMA's website is "definitely" a good one to use in educating young people about smoking.The website features a number of educational videos, such as the one that describes research that shows how the chemical nicotine boosts the appetite of tobacco companies so more smokers can buy more cigarettes, and a one-minute video on smoking in movies that says: "The first rule for smokers--no smoking on set." The website also has an interactive video of a smoker and her child who has a tobacco cigarette smoldering in a jar.Agency officials who gave the AMA the website's name, despite the fact that the	0
For everyone who has condemned the numerous protests, rallies and vigils demanding justice for Trayvon Benjamin Martin, the 17-year-old gunned down in Sanford, Florida, a month ago, please listen to these two words: Shut up! Of course that may seem harsh, but that is exactly how I feel. I don't want to hear the nonsense to let the system run its course. Others say, "Let's not do anything until all of the facts are in." Let's cut to the chase: There would be no special prosecutor had thousands across the national not mobilized, organized and took to the streets to demand justice for Trayvon. Would a grand jury be convened on April 10? Not a chance. Would the 911 tapes be released showing admitted trigger man George Zimmerman calling Trayvon suspicious, and owning up to following him? No. Would the Florida Legislature be reviewing -- and discussing changing or abandoning -- the controversial "Stand Your Ground" law, which is at the heart of this case? No. Would the Department of Justice have launched an investigation into the case, as well as the Sanford Police Department? Nope. Would Sanford's police chief, Bill Lee, have stepped down if the inept investigation hadn't been exposed? No. Instead of critics condemning the protests, they should be saying, "Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" Whether folks want to admit it or not, this has always been the story of African-Americans. Go through history and you will find many examples of cases not being investigated or, if they were brought to trial, prosecuted or judged atrociously: Scottsboro Boys. Clarence Brandley. Lenell Geter. Medgar Evers. The Sixteeenth Street Baptist Church bombing. Justice is supposed to be blind, but for African-Americans, it has commonly been deaf, dumb and blind. As a result, we've had to live by the admonition of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said, "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!" It was also Douglass who stated, "Power concedes nothing without a demand." The main demand in the Trayvon Martin case from Day One was for Zimmerman to be arrested and for justice to be served. This wasn't about a ridiculous bounty on the head of Zimmerman by the New Black Panther Party. It wasn't about the selling of T-shirts. It wasn't about who showed up and led a march or why.	1
Predicting the path of a swine flu outbreak is next to impossible, public health officials say. But Dr. Ira Longini has spent more than three decades trying to do just that. Dr. Ira Longini studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread. And Longini says the apparent new strain of swine flu appears to be here to stay. "We are probably going to have to live with this virus for some time," he told CNN. Longini specializes in the mathematical and statistical theory of epidemics. He works at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute at the Hutchinson Research Center in Seattle, Washington. The researcher studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread across the United States. For the moment, he said, there is not enough information about the swine flu that has sickened hundreds in Mexico and about 50 people in the United States to accurately forecast how the disease will travel. But Longini's simulations of a fictional killer flu that were ordered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show the importance of steps health officials can take to prevent further spread of the virus. These measures include "social distancing," or encouraging those sickened with the flu to stay home or seek medical treatment; closing places where groups of people gather; and making anti-flu medications available to large portions of the population. In the simulations, Longini said, these forms of containment reduce the sickness by nearly two-thirds. "The name of the game is to slow transmission until a well-matched vaccine can be made and distributed. I am fairly optimistic we can do that," he said.  Watch how computer models simulate an outbreak's spread » So far, Longini said, it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the outbreak. But he cautioned: "That could change very fast. Obviously people in these communities could also get on airplanes and go other places or get on buses or cars or trucks and move around. The picture may change very rapidly. Basically, influenza is going to go where people go." Health officials agree that the worst may still be yet to come.	1
Chinese tennis star Li Na revealed she is reaping the rewards of a brutal preseason training regime after reaching the semifinals of the Australian Open for the third time in four years. Sixth seed Li beat the Poland's world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska on Tuesday 7-5 6-3 to advance to the last four of a major for the first time since becoming Asia's first grand slam singles champion at the 2011 French Open. Last year Li began working with Carlos Rodriguez, former trainer of seven-time grand slam winner Justine Henin, after deciding to end her professional relationship with husband Jiang Shan. "We train every day for five, six hours, but not only playing tennis," the 30-year-old told reporters after setting up a tie with world No. 2 Maria Sharapova. "Tennis was like maybe two, three hours. Fitness was for two or three hours as well. "First time I was training with him, I was so excited, but after three days, I was dying. My husband didn't come with me to Beijing. "I called him and said, 'Carlos is crazy'. He was like, 'Why?' I described the program to him. He was like, 'Don't joke.' I said, 'Hey, listen, I'm not making a joke.' " Li, the Australian Open runner-up in 2011, said ending her tennis partnership with her husband had caused many people to think they had also ended their personal relationship. "He was doing a very good job," she said. "But between husband and the coach, it is very tough. Sometimes, if he said 'we should do something' I was feeling tired ... That's why sometimes we have to fight. "The funny thing is I think two years ago someone said I was divorced. They were asking me. They asked me, 'Li Na, we hear you are divorced.' " The extra fitness work paid off for Li as she ground out a victory in one hour and 42 minutes against an opponent who had beaten her at the recent Sydney International event and went into Melbourne undefeated with two titles to her name in 2013.	1
Thailand's rice bowl is now Thailand's nightmare. The Chao Phraya River delta nourishes the nation's vast rice paddies. But Friday, the river and its many tributaries eyed the capital, Bangkok, like a ferocious animal stalking its prey. Monsoonal rains have flooded Thailand's plains and now the bursting river threatens to drown Bangkok. The water has already turned parking lots into marinas, markets into lakes and houses into homes suitable only for fish. It has gushed into houses of the holy -- Buddhist temples stood amid rising water -- and into sanctuaries of the vulnerable. Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a 9-year-old known for its painting skills, are stranded on top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. The elephants climbed on top of the building last week and are going hungry now that food can only be brought in small quantities on rowing boats. Elephants can swim but the babies might drown in an attempt to escape. In Bangkok and other deluged cities and towns, the strong carried the feeble on their backs. The young aided the old. Everyone helped each other. It was hard to imagine that last year, Red Shirts battled Yellow Shirts in deadly political street protests that prompted a state of emergency in Thailand and left a nation deeply divided. Disaster brought them back together this week. An English Facebook page set up to help foreigners in Thailand saw a frenzy of action Friday. "Kidney failure patients'd like to get in dialysis process can contact HSRI co. with NE Kidney Medico" "Free shuttle bus from Dusit Thani hotel to TU DOME available for donation stuffs logistic tomorrow" "Slippers (foam type) needed for any sizes at Don Muang Evacuation Cent." "Both lanes of Bangkruy-Sainoi Rd... flooded" With 283 people dead and another 8 million affected by the flooding, the fears were real in Bangkok. Workers stuffed sandbags furiously and shored up barriers. Evacuation centers began to fill with people. Banjong Palim, 43, said he had never seen anything like this in his lifetime. He was forced to flee when his suburban Bangkok home drowned. Some recalled the devastating 2004 tsunami that wiped out everything with walls of water. And panicked.	1
Wildlife services in California are being pushed to their limits this year. Since January 2015, every month has set a record in sea lion "strandings," mostly sea lion pups, according to the National Oceanic and  Atmosphere Administration.According to a June 2018 report from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, California sea lion strandings in 2017 accounted for a net total of 5,068 pups. The department stated sea lion pup survival rates for 2017 were 92 percent.Sea lion pup survival rates are down from 2016 and 2017. As it turned out, sea lion pup survival rates were down from the highest level of the last 10 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Sea lion pup survival rates in 2017 were down from the highest rate of the last decade, according to a June 2018 report from the USGS."Sea lions are an important and irreplaceable part of our California life cycle, but we need to do everything we can to ensure their survival, particularly when they are young," California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Matthew Duarte told The Associated Press in response to the increase in oceanic sea lion pup strandings.California's oceanic island and mainland sea lion pup strandings are part of a larger problem in the Golden State -- overharvesting and loss of habitat.The largest known California oceanic sea lion pup strandings came in the winter of 2014. In January 2015, the statewide pup survival rate was 93.4 percent.In February 2017, the statewide pup survival rate reached 93.9 percent.In October 2018, the statewide pup survival rate was 91 percent.On July 1, 2017, the pup survival rate plummeted to 91.5 percent.On May 2, 2018, the pup survival rate continued to dip. On that date, the pup survival rate was 88.3 percent.By August 1, 2018, the pup survival rate had fallen to 84 percent.On July 1, 2018, it again reached 82 percent, and on October 3, 2018, it reached 78 percent.In September 2018, the statewide pup survival rate was 82 percent.The pup survival rate in January 2019 was 77 percent.

The body of a University of Georgia professor accused of killing three people was found Saturday buried in woods near Athens, Georgia, authorities said. George Zinkhan, a professor at the University of Georgia,  was found dead in a wooded area of Athens after police received a report of his vehicle and body found in a ditch, the Athens-Clarke County Police Department said in a statement. Zinkhan, a 48-year-old professor at the university, was reported missing after he failed to return home from a faculty meeting in Athens at 11 p.m. Friday, the statement said.A University of Georgia senior was killed by a fellow student Tuesday night after he and the suspect started fighting, according to a report obtained by WSB-TV.The suspect, a 17-year-old resident of the town of Clanton, called police about 9:45 p.m. to report that he had struck the resident, who suffered “multiple stab wounds,” according to a report obtained by the station.The student told police he and the suspect became involved in a physical altercation, according to the report. He said the suspect, also 17, choked and then fatally stabbed him.Police are investigating the matter as an attempted murder and said they’re working to determine if the death is a homicide or an accident.Zinkhan was a doctoral student studying cell signaling in the lab of the George W. Woodruff School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. He worked in the lab of professor George P.

We are now locked in a rolling filibuster on every issue, which is totally gridlocking the U.S. Senate. That is wrong. It is wrong for America." Who said that? Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate? Guess again.   * "And, no, I am not going to have a public hearing." Really? I'll believe that when we see the public hearing that Chuck Schumer has scheduled for this week on the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.  * "I am a pro-life advocate. I believe life begins at conception. I am pro-life, okay?" Okay, fine. I get it, and so do a lot of pro-life women of all political stripes. (For me, it's about the health of the mother and the baby. For her, it's the same.) So why on earth can the president of the United States, who is pro-life, have such a closed mouth? It makes America look more like the United States of Denmark or Sweden, don't it!?  * "It's not only that I voted against the Affordable Care Act." What in the world are you talking about? Oh, wait—I think I already made that quite clear.  * "I'm just a regular person." I am, and so are you. That is why I respect you immensely. That is why this administration has, in fact, become the "regular people's" administration. But, as we all know, regular people are also often very passionate about their opinions and their point of view. That is one reason that this president and most of us are in the middle of what could easily become a partisan war royale.  * "We're on the same side." That's nice and convenient, but it's not necessarily true. What is true is that he and I have a common enemy: the left-leaning, progressive, radical, liberal, globalist, and other assorted totalitarian forces of globalism.  * "I get mad every day." Really? Are you trying to tell me that I am not angry about what you just said? "Every day? No. I get mad at Obama and I get mad at you, and I get mad at his socialist, communist, internationalist, internationalist, globalist, and progressive agenda every single day, every single day."

At least 50 people have died in a school collapse in in Petionville, near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Friday night. Haitians try to help victims at a school that collapsed Friday in Petionville, near Port-au-Prince. Rescue personnel planned to continue working into the night to dig out students and teachers buried in the rubble, the Red Cross said. At least 100 people have been injured, the Haitian Civil Protection Bureau said. The death toll is expected to rise. Officials said the school could have held as many as 700 people when the collapse occurred at 10 a.m. (10 a.m. ET) Some students were in class while others were in a playground, Haitian media reported. "We are looking at major casualties here," Claudon said. He said dozens of students appeared to be trapped inside but couldn't give an exact number. However, he said it was a typical school day and the building had been crowded. Most of the students at the College La Promesse Evangelique range in age from 10 to 20, he said, but there are younger ones as well. Haitian press reports said the school has kindergarten, primary and secondary students. President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis toured the disaster area. "I heard and saw with my own eyes children appealing for help," Preval was quoted as saying on the French language www.haitipressnetwork.com. "We are taking all necessary steps," Pierre-Louis said. " The government has mobilized to save those who can be saved." Preval asked residents to stay away from the area so police and rescue officials could do their work unimpeded. Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts.  Watch as the Red Cross official describes the scene » "On the phone, you can hear so many children, you know, crying, crying and saying, 'this one is dead,' 'that one is dead,' " she said. Claudon said hundreds of bystanders and rescue workers were digging through the rubble, but "what we need right now is heavy search-and-rescue equipment." Claudon later said, "local authorities are doing their best."	1
It was an image that got the nation talking: Two giggling young women in oversized sunglasses robbing a bank. The "Barbie Bandits" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital.  The tale of the "Barbie Bandits" may have been familiar to you, too—the same could be said of the image portrayed in the ad, featuring the gang of three and all the fun that goes along with robbing a bank in a red convertible. The tagline—"Barbie, get your license! Get your license!"—takes a turn for the unexpected when the image shifts away from a car and onto a pair of plaid shorts and T-shirt holding a shotgun—an inversion we've all seen before, in the ad campaign for McDonald's.The image of three young women—a woman's look-alike playing a dangerous game with a loaded weapon—had the desired effect. It was a campaign that seemed to sum up a lot of what was wrong with the economy. Women were getting more and more empowered by having control over their own financial lives, but when they were asked to risk everything in a high-stakes, high-risk endeavor, they became the object of derision rather than admiration. The ad was a perfect example of the dangers of asking girls to take on dangerous, uncharted roles, as if they were no more than their clothes, their shoes, and their hair; as if they were disposable—or at least, not as powerful, responsible, and capable as their male counterparts.In the year following the ad campaign, a whole new crop of girls became the center of attention, taking on the roles of bank robber and the woman who was robbed. At first, they were the young black girls who had dared go to high school at all. But just as quickly they were young white women, as if American society had decided that young white women were the best at being thieves. The bank robber stereotype was still there but now there were three of them, and there was no question of who was in charge. It was a role to be taken, and it was taken a lot.As soon as the women made their debut in the series, they began to become a lightning rod of controversy and scrutiny. They were in it to steal money, but it was often at the risk of taking one's life. And they were going to do it anyway. They	0
Tetiana Chornovol, a prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist beaten on Christmas, said she has a long list of enemies, and that she was sure she would die during the attack. She spoke from a hospital bed Thursday, іn the company of her husband.On Tuesday, she said, pro-Russian activists attacked her home at 2:30 a.m. In her first interview since the attack, Chornovol told The Daily Beast about her life as a volunteer at a pro-Ukrainian association, and the way she was attacked and beaten.On one of her Facebook pages, Chornovol said, she shared a video in which a man described to women in a Kiev hotel the location of her home and other possible targets, including a pro-Russian politician.“I had a list with five or six sites where there’s a chance a shot would be fired at me and my home [would be hit]. I knew I’d run away,” she said.When she was on her way to work, she heard a loud banging on the car window and a voice shouting: “Where’s the Russian whore? Get out of here!”She said that she had never been so scared in her life. “If you ever get home, I’ll beat you up,” someone told her.“I never thought I’d live to tell you this, but he said that. . . it wasn’t just a ‘I’m going to beat you up’ threat; it wasn’t a joke; he said he would hurt me.”She said that the men who attacked her began to force her out of the car at gunpoint. She said they ordered her to walk to the back of the car and that she was hit in the head.Chornovol said that on her way back to the house, she was stopped by another car. She said she recognized a man who had been with the attackers.“He said that he was going to shoot me but I was trying to call my husband to go to the police station,” she said.She said police arrived and took her to a building with a doctor, where she was rushed to the hospital.

On Sunday morning, a strange word suddenly started trending for me on Twitter. The word was Ruzzle. I had no idea what it meant, so I did the smart thing and asked my dog. "Mikey, what's a Ruzzle?" Through nonverbal communication, he indicated that it might have something to do with his groin. Though, to be fair, he'd been indicating this for the better part of an hour. And with varying degrees of intensity. So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device. And for some reason -- I still have no idea why -- at 10 a.m. on Sunday, lots of people were tweeting about it. Thus, I had to learn more. But not really. I don't generally care on Sundays. Or wear pants. Nevertheless, a little half-hearted research revealed that this uber-popular word game seemed to be the offspring of a wild and kinky one-night-stand between Boggle and Scrabble. Apparently, things got a little crazy at the bar, there was a shared cab ride and, lo and behold, we now have Ruzzle. The underlying message: Be careful with tequila, kids. After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name "RealGilbertGottfried") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle. Like Boggle. Each letter is also given a point value based on difficulty, and some even award extra points by doubling or tripling the letter or overall word score. Like Scrabble. In the end, the player with the most points after three rounds is the one who doesn't get shingles. Obviously, it's a game of high stakes. "Hi, boss. Yeah, it's Hank. I won't be in this week. What's that? Yes. Ruzzle. Again." OK, so the player with the most points actually just wins. However, if you're competitive like me, losing is just as bad as a blistering skin rash. Which is why playing my mom was a horrible idea. She always wins. At everything.	1

Jeffrey Fowle never met Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller. But he's been in their shoes. Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained Â?without cause andÂ? subjected to tortureÂ? by a Mexican drug cartel. Fowle has been fighting for his life in the United States, in an ongoing legal battle that has dragged on for three years, while trying to gather the evidence necessary to prove his innocence. With President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as the American government has been, Fowle isn't sure who is telling the truth -- the Mexican government, his lawyers, or the U.S. government, whose torture methods he says were more likely to leave him dead rather than free. But one thing is certain: The U.S. government used its power to coerce Fowle to give up Â?any evidenceÂ? that might exonerate him of criminal charges. After three years of hearings, much of which were carried on by a videoconference, the U.S. government has yet to provide Fowle with a shred of evidence in his defense. It's taken the government nearly three months for it to release the transcripts of Â?an in camera review of the government videosÂ? that were seized from Fowle and his attorney, Barry Krisher, and provided to Fowle's lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union, and to Fowle by Fowle himself. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the first of the lawsuits that eventually brought Fowle to the United States as an immigrant, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, the New Mexico Human Rights Division and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have also been seeking information from Fowle's lawyers, Krisher and David Matas. And all the while, Matas has been in touch with the U.S. government. As Matas would tell us:The U.S. government's first response was to threaten Matas with lawsuits. Then they released those letters they had sent Matas in April of 2005, threatening Matas with litigation, but only after Matas had filed the lawsuit that eventually brought Fowle to the United States. Then they threatened Matas with subpoenas, which they also did after Matas filed the lawsuit. Then they subpoenaed Matas and his	0
Tabloid headlines that "falsely trumpeted" in bold letters that Tom Cruise "abandoned" his young daughter should cost the publisher $50 million, the actor's lawyer said Wednesday. The magazine covers appeared on Life & Style and InTouch in the weeks after Cruise divorced actress Katie Holmes, with whom he shares 6-year-old daughter Suri, according to a defamation lawsuit Cruise filed against the publisher in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Tom is a caring father who dearly loves Suri," Cruise lawyer Bert Fields said. "She's a vital part of his life and always will be. To say he has 'abandoned' her is a vicious lie. To say it in lurid headlines with a tearful picture of Suri is reprehensible." Fields said he sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions, but he was refused in each case. "These serial defamers are foreign-owned companies with their global headquarters in Hamburg," Fields said. "They take money from unsuspecting Americans by selling their malicious garbage. Having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down." Bauer Publishing Group, which publishes both magazines, responded to CNN's request for a reponse with "no comment." The July 30 Life & Style cover read "SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD," under a photograph of Suri appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother's arms, the suit said. The story inside explained she was crying "as a result of Suri being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store," the suit said. The complaint also includes a September In Touch cover that read "44 DAYS WITHOUT TOM ... ABANDONED BY DADDY ... Suri is left heartbroken as Tom suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school... HAS HE CHOSEN SCIENTOLOGY OVER SURI FOR GOOD?" Since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines, "millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge, brightly colored letters that are typically of a false, lurid and titillating nature, and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines' interiors," the suit said.	1
Here's one way to make your iPhone hacker-proof: Ask hackers for advice. I recently caught up with security researchers at the online security conference Infiltrate. At dinner one evening, I placed my iPhone on the table. I was surrounded by ethical hackers whose jobs are to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys and exploit security flaws. "I could hack your phone pretty easily," security researcher Tomi Tuominen mentioned. Obviously, I took notice. For the next 20 minutes, Tuominen and information security researcher Robert Lee gave me a tutorial on making my iPhone settings hacker-proof. Some of them are basic -- like changing your four character password to something more complex. Others take a bit more work, such as using settings to limit ad tracking. For more tips, check out the video.	1
Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says. Jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to Ã¢ÂÂall NigeriansÃ¢ÂÂ, the party said. In the same message, the President said NigeriansÃ¢ÂÂ expectations in the run-up to the poll had been met. Jonathan was declared the winner a day earlier after a re-run of the poll and a re-run of the vote in the Senate. The run-off vote in the House of Representatives was annulled, as were the results in the House of Assembly.Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan accepts defeat after presidential ballotJonathan told supporters of his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of the phone call as they celebrated the defeat of his closest rival for the top job. The decision to call on Buhari, a hardline former military ruler who opposed the idea that the election should be run under the electoral commissionÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂsupervisionÃ¢ÂÂ, was a direct challenge to election commission chief Abubakar Bukola Saraki, who had urged the parties not to challenge the election.The announcement is a blow for Abubakar Bukola Saraki, the chairman of the National Electoral Commission (NEC), a former Nigerian military ruler who has spent decades building a reputation as a defender of democracy.. Saraki has been accused by some of working to undermine the credibility of the election, which was a surprise upset in which the APC got a surprise victory only to see the vote overturned after a run-off in the Senate on Monday. Saraki, who was chosen as head of the body by Nigeria's main opposition party, the All Progressives Congress, had said he would not back the re-run of the presidential election and was ready to contest the annulment of it.In his statement, Jonathan said he had met the leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the past weeks and urged them to support the re-run of the election. "I am writing to all Nigerians to accept the decision of the people and to thank the party leaders who have supported me and made this	0
Verizon Wireless has fired employees connected to a breach of records from a cell phone used by President-elect Barack Obama this year, a Verizon source said Friday. An Obama spokesman said Verizon Wireless workers looked through an old phone's billing records. The source would not say how many people were terminated but said "we now consider this matter closed." Verizon reported the breach Thursday, and Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said the transition team had been notified Wednesday. Gibbs said the president-elect no longer uses that phone, which has been inactive for months. The fired employees were hired "to take care of customers," the Verizon source said, and were not authorized to access customer records unless asked to do so by the customer. The source also said the employees in question could not have read text messages, if Obama sent or received them, and would not have been able to access the content of any voice mail messages, although they would have been able to see whether any had been left. "This was some employees' idle curiosity," the source said, adding that records of no other customers of note were breached. Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the employees probably had access to the dates and times of calls, the length of calls and the telephone numbers of those Obama spoke with. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said Thursday that the company initially put all employees who had access to the account, "whether authorized or not," on leave during an investigation. McAdam said the device on the account was a simple voice flip-phone, not a BlackBerry or other smartphone designed for e-mail or other data services, meaning none of Obama's e-mail could have been accessed. Verizon Wireless, meanwhile, has launched a separate internal investigation to determine whether Obama's information was shared only among employees or whether "the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company, and this investigation continues," McAdam said in an internal e-mail obtained by CNN. The company has alerted "the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities," McAdam said. CNN's Brian Todd and Ed Henry contributed to this report	1
The celebratory champagne should be well-chilled by now. After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more  than 5,000 passengers from more than 10 cities — and no one seems to be complaining a whiff.But a new survey by the University of Southern California and San Jose State University suggests that just a few people aboard the brand-new 787 are already experiencing what the airline industry calls "first-class service."Of the 13.4 million people who have been in the air on the 787 in its short life, only 549,000 actually paid the full fare ($1,295 in economy class seats, for example) for a seat in first class, or just 3.6 percent of the full complement, according to the study.To put that number into perspective, the survey's statisticians extrapolated the average fare — and other facts — from the airlines' own public data, estimating that nearly two million passengers a year will ride aboard the first Boeing 787 Dreamliner."Our research shows that the people flying today are flying first class, and they are paying full-fare," said Daniel Castro, one of the survey's authors and a visiting scholar at the USC School of Business."It is an amazing feat of engineering. The 787 will be a game changer. I don't think the average person will be able to remember when a new airplane was invented or how much it cost 10 years from now," said Castro, who has a background in airplane safety and has written a book on the topic.But he cautioned that the findings — which were based on surveys of travelers, as well as on interviews with airline executives and employees, and on an analysis of airline ticket prices — may not hold up if more passengers try to buy the tickets."This data is going to be a rough metric when the service comes in."The results also don't account for the full effect of Boeing's cost-cutting and production delays, which have cut the average commercial jetliner's service life in half, from nine years to six. And that's not by coincidence.Boeing itself is not being coy when it comes to the numbers."As a company we have to respond to both customer and competitor feedback," said Boeing's	0
Michael Jackson's father filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against Dr. Conrad Murray on Friday, the anniversary of the pop star's death, Joe Jackson's lawyer said. The suit alleges that Murray gave paramedics and doctors false ids, "mislead[ed][] and/or misinform[ed][]" them, and failed to properly treat his son's diabetes while he was in a coma, according to court documents.In a letter sent Friday, Jackson's father Joe Jackson demanded Murray's medical license be yanked, but the doctor's defense attorney argued that the singer's condition was an emergency.The suit was part of a larger $500 million lawsuit filed by the family against Murray's hospital in Georgia. The suit alleges wrongful death, battery, and negligence in medical care.While Jackson's case was just filed on Friday, the complaint claims that Murray was the "author of the falsification and misconduct." His hospital staff were trained "how to falsify medical ID’s and the falsification of medical records and records for Jackson’s medical treatment,” alleges the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.Jackson, who was known to be a patient at the hospital where he was treated, was rushed to the hospital at the start of his illness, having gone into cardiac arrest on Jan. 27, 2009, his mother Katherine Jackson wrote in the court document. Murray was a doctor at the hospital as well.Jackson suffered a fatal heart attack in his hotel room at the Atlanta airport on Monday, Jan. 29, 2009, the document says. He had been in the Atlanta airport for a promotional tour for his “This Is It” tour.The complaint alleges that Dr. Conrad Murray's emergency room staff gave him incorrect or misleading diagnoses before Jackson was taken to his room to be given CPR. The complaint also alleges that Dr. Murray falsified medical documents and records in order to conceal the condition of the singer's health during his treatment.Murray's hospital was closed and he was fined $25,000 for not filing a report properly, according to the document.Murray did not immediately return a call Saturday. When a reporter texted him to ask for comment, his attorney said an internal review of the hospital's actions had been completed.In July, U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Bryan ruled	0
Call them drones; call them toy airplanes with digital cameras dropped into their girths. Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good. Three diminutive single-engine unmanned propeller planes that look like they could have come from a hobby shop were found on the ground in March and April in parts of the South near the border with the northern Communist regime. Though the low-tech buzzers don't seem to represent a major danger, they come in the shadow of North Korean missile launches and the impending countdown to the test of a nuclear device. And they made it through South Korean air defenses. Ministry of National Defense officials in Seoul immediately suspected that the sky-blue colored fliers belonged to Pyongyang. They formed an investigation team with the United States in mid-April to analyze the "travel log file" and photos taken by the drones and announced the results on Friday. Scientists found a "smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea," South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said. Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path, he said. Precarious cargo Had the mechanical carrier pigeons made it back home, they would have delivered precarious cargo, but it would have been far from precious. Japanese-made digital cameras, which look like they could be of the consumer variety, were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region. All three were programmed to fly over military facilities, and two of them had images of targets of military interest -- strategically important islands near the demilitarized zone, and the Blue House, residence and office of South Korea's President Park Geun-hye. Images from the third drone were not available to South Korean investigators. A wild ginseng digger had stumbled upon the plane and had deleted its memory card so he could use it himself, the Korea Times reported. The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time, and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth, Kim said in a previous briefing. Limited capabilities There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.	1
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has welcomed the return by Australia of two ancient Hindu art treasures that were allegedly stolen from temples in Tamil Nadu. During a meeting with Modi in New Delhi on Friday Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott handed over a 900-year bronze statue of Shiva Nataraja (dancing Shiva) and a stone statue of Ardhanariswara (Shiva in half-female form), also from circa 1100. "I would like to convey to Prime Minister Abbott the deep sense of gratitude of 1.25 billion people of India for the efforts he has made to bring with him two ancient statues that were stolen from India," Modi said. Modi said Abbott and the people of Australia "have shown enormous respect and regard not only for our ancient treasures, but also for our cultural heritage." The National Gallery of Australia in Canberra bought the Shiva Natarja for $5 million (A$5.3 million) in 2008 from then New York-based art dealer Subhash Kapoor. Kapoor was arrested in Germany in 2011 after U.S. investigators raided Manhattan storage units allegedly leased in his name, and found items "displayed in major international museums worldwide." Kapoor was subsequently extradited to India where he's awaiting trial. The former owner of the Art of the Past Gallery, Kapoor sold the Ardhanariswara to the Sydney-based Art Gallery of New South Wales for $280,000 (A$300,000) in 2004. In March this year, the Indian Government wrote to Australia seeking the return of the two idols. In a statement to mark Abbott's return of the two statues in New Delhi, the National Gallery of Australia said it "would never knowingly purchase a stolen or looted item." It said the gallery had undertaken lengthy, comprehensive and independent research before it bought the Shiva Nataraja from Kapoor. "Despite these efforts, court proceedings may yet confirm that the gallery has been a victim of a most audacious fraud," gallery director Ron Radford said. Radford noted that Kapoor's trial "is yet to be heard and he has proclaimed his innocence."	1
There are around 200 known types of cancers. Some are far more widespread than others. Australian Professor Ian Frazer has developed a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and is working on a vaccine for skin cancer. Cancer researchers are making erythroblastosis fetalis a priority so that scientists can isolate and sequence the genes that cause the disease.Spiral cancer cells are also known as spiroma and can occur in breast, colon, lung, prostate and stomach. More people die from cancers of the cervix than any other type of cancer. More than 250,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year.In 2015, the death rate from cancer in Australia was 8.0 per 100,000 people, making it the fifth most common leading cause of death in the country.# Australia's cancer statisticsBreast Cancer | 24,800 (1 per 100,000)  ---|---  Stomach Cancer | 18,300 (1 per 100,000)  Esophageal Cancer | 8,500 (0.6 per 100,000)  Colon Cancer | 8,400 (0.5 per 100,000)  Prostate Cancer | 6,900 (0.4 per 100,000)  Lung Cancer | 6,700 (0.4 per 100,000)  Liver Cancer | 5,100 (0.4 per 100,000)  Lymphoma | 4,900 (0.3 per 100,000)  Lymphomas | 4,100 (0.3 per 100,000)  Leukaemia | 4,300 (0.3 per 100,000)  Leukaemias | 3,900 (0.3 per 100,000)  Brain Tumour | 1,800 (0.1 per 100,000)  Multiple myeloma | 1,600 (0.1 per 100,000)  Chromosomal Cancer | 250 (0.0 per 100,000)  Cervical Cancer | 250 (0.0 per 100,000)# Cancer in Australia by sexData from the National Men's Health Study 2005–2010.# Cancer statisticsCancer statistics in Australia are a complex and constantly evolving picture.

Bahrain on Tuesday warned against anti-government activity one day ahead of its plans to lift emergency laws that had allowed for a crackdown on opposition leaders, journalists and other activists. The country's Ministry of Justice warned against ills that could lead to chaos in the country as the country's opposition leaders were given jail time and more than a thousand people have been jailed since the 2011 elections, when the country turned against political opponents.The U.N. and some human rights groups, however, expressed concerns that the move threatened the independence and credibility of the country's judiciary by allowing the government to arrest individuals on unsubstantiated charges. The government and the opposition have accused each other of manipulating the judiciary in the past, and they accuse each other of engaging in other forms of political activity while the country is in a volatile period.The country's ruling Shia party has been criticized for spending millions of dollars to buy influence in the country. On Tuesday, an opposition member of parliament, Hamad Saeed, resigned, saying that the ruling party had done everything it could to discredit him for seeking to investigate the corruption he alleges was rampant in the country's political system. The leader of the opposition bloc has criticized the government, calling the action on Tuesday "a blatant violation and a disgrace."But the ruling party has said it was acting "in response to a grave threat to the safety of the country" and "in order to safeguard the country's security and sovereignty." The state minister for information announced the moves on Tuesday as part of a package of measures the government said was necessary to counter a range of threats to national security.State minister for national security and foreign affairs Anas Mahmoud gave a detailed explanation of the measures on Tuesday, which included the removal of any legal barriers to a national dialogue between the government and opposition to ensure a free and peaceful country, state television reported.Mahmoud told the Associated Press that if the opposition has any issues with the government, they should "talk to us and not to the parliament," as he said "there is no threat against the country."He also said a national dialogue will be held to discuss the political status of Bahrain, among other options.The opposition's calls for parliamentary elections, which were shelved when parliament was dissolved for two weeks by the opposition, remain popular among the people.The opposition's campaign for the removal of emergency laws, however, has been unpopular with voters	0
After learning that Ashton Kutcher had landed in the hospital trying to follow Steve Jobs' all-fruit diet, CNN reader Sumday had just one question: "All I really wanted to know was why this diet was bad?" Jobs first fell for extreme diets during his freshman year of college, according to Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs." Jobs and his college friend Daniel Kottke became vegetarians after reading "Diet for a Small Planet." Then Jobs read "Mucusless Diet Healing System" by Arnold Ehret; Ehret believed in eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables like spinach, carrots and cucumbers. Jobs began with two-day fruit fasts, eventually going for a week or more. "I got into it in my typical nutso way," Jobs told Isaacson. Ehret's fruitarian diet, also called the Eden Garden Diet or Ehretism, is often used as a type of cleanse, according to LiveStrong.com. Designed to detoxify the system, it can do more long-term harm than good. When you only eat fruit, you're excluding a lot of valuable nutrients from your diet, says Marisa Moore, registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Protein is one of the main ones that comes to mind," she says. "(Without protein) you lose body weight. Protein acts like a building block for your muscles and skin and organs." The same goes for fats, Moore says. Although they often get demonized, fats play an important role in our hormone levels and brain function. Kutcher told reporters at the Sundance Film Festival that he ended up in the hospital with pancreas levels that were "completely out of whack." Steve Jobs movie premieres to mixed reviews Fruit contains a lot of natural sugar, which needs to be controlled by insulin in the body, Moore says. It's the pancreas' job to release that insulin; Kutcher's pancreas may have been overworked if his body was receiving an overload of sugar. Many readers wondered if an all-fruit diet could have led to Jobs' pancreatic cancer, which led to his death in October 2011. Scientists don't know what causes pancreatic cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Certain inherited DNA mutations might play a role, as well as chemicals in our environment or diet.	1
As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that "then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end," according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. "Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left," Bush will say. "Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' " the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. "Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently," Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, "President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. "While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall." The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to "provide broader context" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad.	1
South Korea will conduct naval fire drills near a flashpoint with the North that resulted in the deaths of four people, military officials said Thursday. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff announced the exercises will take place in the seas southwest of Yeonpyeong Island on a day to be announced between December 18 and 21. The South previously announced military exercises for this week, but Thursday's announcement adds to them. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled the island, which lies in South Korean territory. The attacked killed two marines and two civilians and injured 18 people. Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. North Korea Thursday accused the South's new defense minister, Kim Kwan-jin, of "going reckless like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger," state-run KCNA reported. During his confirmation hearing this month, Kim said South Korea would respond with airstrikes if the North attacks it again. The South Korean joint chiefs said the drills will be carried out in the presence of officials from the Military Armistice Committee and representatives from U.N. party members to ensure that the exercise is lawful and follows rules of the armistice.	1
When Michael Jackson died unexpectedly two years ago, his fans worldwide erupted in a torrent of grief, anguish and -- in tribute to the pop icon -- song and dance. On Monday, there were hugs, tears and shrieks of joy among his fans ̵and the fans of the other superstars who died this year in the past decade. While few of us mourned the death of Michael Jackson in the same way we mourned that of the late Diana Ross in 2005 (when she died after a protracted illness) or the late Whitney Houston in 1997 (when she died of a heart attack), the outpouring of love for Jackson was something different: it was the same outpouring of love for the other stars who died suddenly over the past decade.It is an outpouring that has nothing to do with the singer’s death. Michael Jackson was a remarkable and controversial personality, full of contradictions. He did some things that made him a superstar and some things that made him a social pariah. He was more interested in performing and being the center of attention than he was in his music. He was an exhibitionist, he was reckless, he was greedy, and he was an alcoholic. Michael Jackson created a legacy of controversy in part because of his eccentric behavior. But we also have to remember that Jackson had a huge fan base, which played a large part in his success, and many people loved him for his music.The outpouring of condolences in support of the other stars who died suddenly over the past decade has nothing to do with their deaths. Some of them had a great life. Others had a great career. They should have lived long enough to enjoy it.There are two major causes of death in the past decade -- the opioid crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. The opioid crisis killed more than 4,000 Americans in 2017. It killed 6,000 Americans last year alone. (The number in 2017 is likely to be larger than the deaths recorded last year because of the increase in the number of overdose deaths that were not counted in the official numbers.) And yet the outpouring of grief over the deaths of Jackson, Ross and others is not about those deaths. It is about some other things: celebrity worship, entertainment, a lack of personal responsibility, and a life that was short but fun.First, let’s talk about why the ‘Jackson Five’ are not mourned in the same way	0
The friend who was on the phone with Trayvon Martin when his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman began said Monday she is "disappointed, upset, angry, questioning and mad" at Zimmerman's acquittal on murder -------------------------The jury in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman earlier in 2012 said it was unable to reach a decision on whether to convict Zimmerman for the teenager's death.The three-man, three-woman jury unanimously found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder.However, the eight men and women serving on the second floor of a Tallahassee, Florida courthouse were deadlocked on whether to convict Zimmerman on manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.The split decision came after deliberations that stretched into a week as the panel deliberated over an issue of credibility for the prosecution's star witness, Zimmerman's former neighbor who testified about the February 26, 2012 incident.The decision is the result of a series of interviews with the jurors during the two-week deliberations that began last week and continued through Monday.During the deliberations, Juror No. 4, who was interviewed by lawyers and the media, spoke of his feelings during the trial.He has told CNN only that he is "disappointed," "upset" and "angry."He added: "I just don't think it was an adequate defense. He made a lot of mistakes and I don't want him to get away with murder."When he said those words, he was in the minority. Six of the eight were for acquittal. No one was for conviction.But Juror No. 6, the lone woman on the panel, said she agrees with Juror No. 4 that Zimmerman's defense was not enough -- "It didn't do a lot of good in my opinion."Trayvon Martin's friend said as the jury reached the decision, the public began asking her the same questions she is asking when speaking to CNN."I've been thinking about it for seven months. I haven't really talked with anybody about it. This is the thing that got me," she said. "They don't have time and the public never has time to ask the questions that are necessary.""I am disappointed that someone isn't going to prison. I am disappointed in the law itself. It isn't fair," she added. "It doesn't	0
A man apparently angry over a poor performance evaluation entered an Ohio State University maintenance building early Tuesday and opened fire, killing a manager before turning the gun on himself, police said. Larry Wallington, 48, a building services manager at the OSU Maintenance Building, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 3:30 a.m. ET shooting, Ohio State University Police Chief Paul Denton said. Wallington was a 10-year university employee, he said. Authorities found suspect Nathaniel Brown, 51, a custodial worker, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene, Denton said. He was transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was dead on arrival. Police believe Brown -- a probational employee since October who had received a poor performance review -- entered the building dressed in dark clothing carrying two handguns and began firing into an office suite, Denton said. Officials would not say when Brown received the review, who gave it to him or provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation. A third person, Henry Butler, 60, an operations shift leader, also was shot. He was in stable condition at the OSU Medical Center, Denton said. Police earlier Tuesday had said that two people were wounded and one killed and that the alleged shooter was in custody. About a half-dozen employees were at the building when the shooting occurred, and some witnessed it, authorities said. Ohio State's Web site said the building where the shooting occurred was secured, and some traffic restrictions remained in place Tuesday morning. "The university continues normal operations," the school said. "Classes will be held and normal work schedules are in effect." E-mail alerts were sent to students warning them about the shooting, the university said. The shooting comes after the university issued e-mail alerts last week about two alleged sexual assaults and an attempted assault on campus, Ohio State's student newspaper reported. The student newspaper, The Lantern, published an article Sunday saying that students were questioning the effectiveness of such e-mail alerts after three serious crimes last week. Students are allowed to choose if they want to receive the e-mail alerts. On the campus of 50,000-plus students, a little more than 2,600 people receive the e-mails, police told the student paper. A university committee was scheduled to meet this week to determine if changes needed to be made to the notification system, The Lantern reported. CNN's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.	1
Daniel Flesch, then a college student at the University of Illinois, had heard too much anti-Israeli sentiment. He had family members who had survived the Holocaust and felt compelled to fight back at what he perceived as a growing level of  anti-Semitism and the dehumanization of Israelis. He decided to launch an online petition opposing Israel’s settlement policy. His efforts ultimately led to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which today has reached a global scale by successfully driving out some of the wealthiest corporations from engaging in activities that allegedly violate human rights.At the time of Flesch’s work, the Israeli government had been working for months to reach a peace deal with Palestinians, and the country was embroiled in what was widely viewed as an attempt by the Israeli government to establish a Jewish state on the West Bank. Flesch thought his petition was going to get a lot of attention but was not the first to bring the subject to his attention. His fellow students on campus wanted to be proactive but were not successful in getting any of their professors to take up the cause.“I thought there were other people who thought they knew what was best for Israel,” Flesch told me. “But many of them turned on me and said, ‘This will get you nowhere. It’s just going to get us kicked out of school and then you’ll be out of school.’ ”In fact, the BDS movement led, in part, to Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005.“The goal was to get them the same thing that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement has done for the Palestinians. It was a way to make sure the Palestinians have a voice and were taken seriously,” says Michael J. Sfard, who has been active in Israel-Palestinian affairs for decades.The idea isn’t new. At the dawn of the American civil rights movement in the 1950s, African Americans began pressuring companies, which had discriminated against them, to withdraw their support. By the 1970s, the issue was taking on a new, less political form. Companies that refused to do business with the South African government were fined or expelled. Now, companies are facing the risk of the same kind of punishment—and, if the BDS movement is successful, of	0
"7-Eleven killed the minibar." The sentiments of one hotel manager in Hong Kong could well extend to hotels around the world. The hotel minibar, loved and cursed at by millions of desperate midnight snackers/drinkers,  had been ripped out by a 7-Eleven convenience store in China's capital on Monday night. The incident was the latest in a string of 7-Eleven-related tragedies that have claimed, among others, people in Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.In Japan, hundreds of people gathered outside a 7-Eleven convenience store on Nov. 5 and tried to prevent the store's manager and employees from reopening until they reached a settlement with the company. The manager was fired for allegedly refusing to close the store while the company, which made a profit of $300,000 a year, was trying to resolve a dispute with the manager's family.A similar struggle erupted after 7-Eleven employees in Brazil cut off a telephone line to a neighboring 7-Eleven store. Police said the dispute went beyond a disagreement over the cost of the 7-Eleven minibar and into a dispute over whether the company violated a community service agreement.In Australia, a 7-Eleven store in Adelaide, South Australia, was stormed by a mob that smashed storefront glass doors, tried to set fire to cash registers, and damaged equipment, according to KOTA-TV news. More than 50 people were removed from the shop after police intervened. Police charged four people with attempted damage to a business and damage to property before they were released. No charges were filed against the store's employees.The Hong Kong hotel manager cited above, who lives off 24 hours, was not at his job when the store was attacked. No one from the 7-Eleven management, nor the store manager's family, is said to have been hurt by the robbery but they have been told to file a police report. It is not clear what has happened to the shop's manager.In New Zealand, the manager of a 7-Eleven convenience store in Palmerston North was fired for refusing to close the store as soon as the manager said he would after a dispute between the manager and his family over the costs of the 7-Eleven minibar. (A 7-Eleven spokesman said the store would remain open if its manager could reach an agreement but	0
Up to 30 million people are facing "a humanitarian disaster" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday. Porters remove goods from a boat on Lake Chad in 2007. Lake Chad was about the size of Maryland -- bigger than Israel or Kuwait -- in 1963, satellite images show. By 2001, it covered less than one-fifth of that area -- making it smaller than Delaware or Mauritius. The drying-up of the shallow lake is fueling conflict and migration, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said. Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "If that happens it's going to be a disaster," Parviz Koohafkan, director of the Land and Water Division of the FAO, told CNN by phone from Rome. The Lake Chad basin is "one of the most important agriculture heritage sites in the world -- the biodiversity, the migratory birds, not to mention more than 20 million people living out of Lake Chad -- fisherpeople, farmers." "It would be a human disaster, a tragedy," he said. "In this case we have people who are the poorest of the poor." "In addition to an approximately 60 percent decline in fish production, there has been degradation of pasturelands, leading to a shortage of animal feed estimated at 45 percent in certain places in 2006, reduction in livestock and biodiversity," the agency said. The disappearance of the lake is being caused by climate change, population pressure and natural variations in climate, the FAO said. Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said. The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, "Saving Lake Chad," in Rome, Italy, on Friday. "Water transfer is not a new thing," Koohafkan told CNN. "The major problem is that this is water transfer among different countries. "These options cost money, and need policy work, need technical work," he said. "Some kind of public-private partnership would be needed" to pay for any solution as ambitious as diverting a river.	1
Former President Carter warned members of Congress on Tuesday that America's failure to achieve energy independence is threatening the country's national security, undermining its long-term potential for economic growth and contributing to global warming. While the former president criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its failure to regulate energy suppliers, he acknowledged that his administration's policies significantly increased America's use of energy. According to administration reports, the United States purchased as much as 16 percent of its oil and 25 percent of its natural gas from overseas, up 31 percent and 49 percent, respectively, from 1977 to 1980. While Carter noted that this increased reliance on foreign oil diminished America's long-term ability to remain dependable, he stressed the need to sustain U.S. foreign dominance, avoid losing control of natural resources and preserve the country's ability to maintain energy production. The former president predicted that despite the increase in domestic production of oil and natural gas, the United States will still depend on foreign oil by the year 2030. "We can't get there by going into the international market," said Carter, who asserted that a "free and open international market" would "solve our energy problems." However, he warned that America must maintain its strategic presence in the Middle East and in OPEC (the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries). In the latter instance, however, Carter cited recent terrorist attacks as a reason for maintaining America's strategic position. He said that "We must be willing to bear the risk of our own security, but also to be willing to confront the difficulties of defense." According to Carter, it could be a matter of national security whether the United States remains able to maintain its freedom from oil from the Middle East. "I think it is a question of security," he said. The former president also warned that America's present dependence on foreign oil was threatening to undermine its future economic prosperity, which had been one of America's great advantages. "Economic growth creates jobs and opportunities, but growth doesn't make the country energy independent," Carter said.Power shortages, high prices and shortages of supplies, are threatening	0
Allied forces suffered a day of heavy losses in Afghanistan Friday after a helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and an attack killed four French soldiers, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal. The Marines died after their CH-53 helicopter crashed in Helmand province, a U.S. military official said. The NATO-led force reported no enemy activity in the area, but the Taliban claimed credit for bringing down the chopper. Separately, an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers and injured 15 others, one critically, in eastern Afghanistan, French officials said. President Nicolas Sarkozy said he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result. "The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers," he said. France could bring its troops back early from Afghanistan if the necessary security is not restored, Sarkozy said. France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Sarkozy will send French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan, he said. "It was during a training session inside the base that a shooter killed four of our soldiers. This is unacceptable and demands a full investigation," Longuet said. A French official told CNN the French troops were unarmed as they were inside their base, conducting normal training operations with their Afghan partners. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said 15 soldiers were injured. The attack in Kapisa province follows a similar shooting last month by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment, also in eastern Afghanistan. Friday's suspected shooter, who was a member of the Afghan National Army, has been apprehended, according to an ISAF statement. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was deeply saddened by incident. "France has been generous to provide extensive assistance to Afghanistan over the past 10 years," Karzai said. "Throughout history, the two countries have enjoyed a sincere relationship, which the Afghan people will always cherish." Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid called the attack "sensible." "This was the latest attack by those sensible and zealous Afghans who have entered the enemy's army and it was also the best one so far as it killed more soldiers than any other such attacks before,' Mujahid said.	1
Jawbone's UP activity-monitoring wristbands have been failing at an alarming rate. Three review units have failed during Gadget Lab testing, numerous complaints of "bricked" units riddle Jawbone's user forums, and the clever health and fitness product currently receives just two out of five stars on Amazon.com reviews -- 41 different user reviews were complaining of 23 bricked devices as of press time. Today, Jawbone CEO Hosain Rahman issued a statement on Jawbone's website explaining the cause of the failures, and offered a comprehensive, perhaps unprecedented, refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase. Apparently, problems with circuit board capacitors are to blame for the litany of units that have trouble keeping a charge, exhibit erratic data-recording behavior, or just plain stop working. Rahman's message to customers reports the following: "We've found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands. We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware. Typically, these issues surface within the first seven to ten days of use. The glitches are purely performance related and do not pose any safety risk." When the wristband works properly, it records all your daytime footsteps, and later provides a visual report of your walking, running or hiking activity via a nifty iOS app interface. You can also set the band to give you "Activity Reminders" -- gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps. The UP system also offers nighttime sleep monitoring, providing rich visual graphs detailing periods of deep and light sleep. Well, that's how the UP system operates when working. In our experience with three different failed bands, problems ran a frustrating gamut. One band issued random vibrations (even though no reminders were set) and consistently dropped data before failing to keep a charge, and then dying completely. The other two bands simply exhibited syncing failures before bricking for good. In his statement, Rahman says that Jawbone has "temporarily paused production" of the bands, and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware's technical issues have been resolved. Jawbone's VP of Product Management and Strategy Travis Bogard told Wired.com, "We will bring it back as fast as we can."	1
Beset by war and sectarian violence, Iraq has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years. But a trio of old friends from Baghdad have sought to change that, by distilling the jokey banter of their vernacular life into an easygoing, endearingly self-deprecating song.Raed Al-Tahir's father was a famous Iraqi actor, his mother a popular singer.And that was a problem. Like many women in Iraq's conservative society, Tahir found herself out of a job. Instead of retiring, she and her mother opened a small cafe in the centre of Baghdad. It was a way for her and her mother to provide for their younger son and to provide her with something of a career.I didn't know where we were going with this. I thought it would be a joke — the old joke about the joke that was.Iraq has had a long and proud tradition of jokes, especially during war, to provide a means of bonding friends. On the other hand, the recent death of an Iraqi comedian, Ashin Jalil, prompted a new wave of reflection.We have spent a lot of time fighting each other over the last five years.The jokes are the only thing that keep us going — the only thing to keep us from losing our senses of humour. The joke is a way to put the things that we hate into perspective. They're not important. We can laugh about whatever.When it was suggested that we would have a laugh at the funeral of Ashin Jalil, I thought it was very touching. And funny. But very difficult when we are in the thick of the war. In all the time of fighting, there's never been a moment when we have been in laughter. We have spent a lot of time fighting each other over the last five years, and now it's the funeral of Ashin Jalil. We are on the frontline.After a decade in Baghdad, Tahir began her career as an actor, but as her career unfolded, she found herself increasingly frustrated — a woman in a job traditionally reserved for men.People have told me, because they know how the society is, "the women in the society, they are all like that. They go into theatre, they have all these problems." They forget that for a moment.I don't know how I found a job	0
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Thursday that the U.N. Security Council is not doing enough to root out Sudanese war criminals suspected of genocide. Fatou Bensouda said her team of investigators had uncovered an "ongoing pattern of crimes committed pursuant to the government-avowed goal of stopping the rebellion in Darfur," noting specific attacks on peacekeepers and civilians in the region. She then blasted the council, asking "how many more civilians must be killed, injured and displaced for this council to be spurred into doing its part?" The International Criminal Court has been seeking the arrest of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on charges of genocide during a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur, a province in western Sudan that is about the size of Spain. Some 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. A June 2011 Human Rights Watch report said that about 70,000 people had become displaced by aerial from Darfur bombardments since the preceding December.	1
As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart would fill with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before every meet. When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army. Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After graduating with a communications degree in 2002, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps. At 23 years old, Stockwell was deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, her life changed forever. She was part of a routine convoy going through central Baghdad when a big explosion went off. "Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve," she recalls. "The woman in the front yells IED, IED, we've hit an IED!" Stockwell's left leg was gone. "It sounds strange, but as soon as I was told I didn't have my leg, I knew it was going to be OK," the veteran says. "I just kind of had this almost peaceful feeling that, alright, it's going to be alright. Life isn't over." While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients. "You see these other soldiers and these other veterans that are missing two limbs, three limbs, sometimes four limbs ... and I looked at myself and I just really thought I'm one of the lucky ones and I kind of made a decision then that I was going to live my life for those who couldn't." Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and become independent, but she knew she wouldn't feel like herself until she got back into sports. Opinion: Every day should be Veterans Day "Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs," she says. Four months after her injury, she went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities. After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient medically retired from the Army. Stockwell went back to school for a new career in prosthetics at Century College in Minnesota.	1
After the vote in the House of Representatives to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I wrote a column against cutting food stamps. This column generated more than 5,200 online comments and hundreds of e-mails. Comments reflected, not surprisingly, the tone and tenor of the political debate: a lot of partisan passion, some mutual understanding, animosity based on stereotypes and a lot of misinformation. I would like to address some of the typical concerns that were expressed. For example, "Willis CurryFans" wrote, "These wealthy Republicans spend a lot of time RUNNING from the typical black person this affects. If they came and visited some of these neighborhoods, they would see folks that they KNOW they won't give a job to." But who are the people using food stamps? They're us. The Census Bureau, which gathers statistics house by house, reports that Americans on food stamps are 49% white, 26% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The Pew Research Center, a nonprofit polling firm, found in a July survey that self-identified liberals, moderates and conservatives who receive food stamps are in a statistical tie. A lot of people who commented on the column wanted to regulate what foodstuffs program participants can buy -- often not realizing that alcohol and prepared foods are banned. And many respondents bashed food stamp recipients, declaring they should "get a job," "stop having kids on my dime" or giving a variation on such cliches. "Chiefpr" writes to one reader who's been out of work: "Get training to better yourself and DO NOT have kids until you can feed them. But do not demand I do all that and support you ..." But the truth refutes the cliches: Feeding America says participation in SNAP, or the food stamp program, "historically follows unemployment with a slight lag." Unemployment increases food stamp rolls, not people with children who go looking for aid. And unemployment has been abnormally high because of the recession that began under the previous president. In fact, USA Today found that "under President George W. Bush, the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million. Nothing before comes close to that." With employment increasing, "the Congressional Budget Offices projects SNAP participation to begin declining in 2015."	1
News of Angelina Jolie's decision to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy has instantly increased awareness of hereditary forms of cancer caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. While the BRCA1 and  BRCA2 genes have previously been linked to one form of breast cancer, they also have been implicated in ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The new study, published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is the first to look at the association between these genes and the risk for developing all three forms of breast cancer. The researchers used data from UK Biobank, which has collected genetic data on more than 1,500,000 individuals, and used a statistical technique known as "comparative epidemiology" to examine the relationship between these three forms of breast cancer and three different mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. They found that while none of the mutations in any individual gene were associated with the risk for developing breast cancer overall, the mutations in the BRCA2 gene were associated with an increased risk for all three forms of breast cancer, including invasive ductal, lobular, and medullary. The researchers also found evidence that these mutations may result in an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have two or more of the mutations in the BRCA2 gene."Our study found that women carrying the BRCA2 mutation have an increased risk of developing all three types of breast cancer, but the risk is greatest if they also have a mutation in another gene," said study lead author Emily Kallweit, a Cancer Epidemiology Outcomes Research Fellow at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. "There is strong evidence that mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase women's odds of developing breast cancer, and we've shown that it is the BRCA2 mutation that is most predictive of increased risk.""These findings will guide doctors and patients who are trying to decide whether to undergo prophylactic surgery for breast cancer, which carries different risks for different patients," said lead study author Daniel Fisher, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "BRCA2 mutations in men have been associated with a lower risk of developing breast tumors. By contrast, women with two or more BRCA2 mutations and one BRCA1 or BRCA	0
China has removed 162,629 "phantom staff" from government payrolls, as Beijing presses on with a campaign against official corruption and misuse of public money, state media reported. Hebei province in central China was the worst offender, with 55,793 officials found to be getting paid even though they never worked, followed by Sichuan and Henan, state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. No "phantom employees" were found in Shanghai and Tibet, the report added. President Xi Jinping has made rooting out corruption a top priority since taking power amid widespread suspicion that government officials use their position for personal gain. The People's Daily also said that 114,418 official vehicles had been scrapped out of a total of 119,846. China has promised to phase out the use of government vehicles by the end of 2015, except for those used for emergencies and law enforcement. The news reports did not shed light on how employees could receive a paycheck without showing up for work, but Hong Kong-based commentator Frank Ching said it was not unheard of for senior Chinese officials to employ friends and family members.	1
The security plans for the London Marathon this weekend are being reassessed after the deadly bomb blasts in Boston, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. Police and race organizers said they are working closely on security for Sunday's race. About 35,000 runners take part in the London Marathon each year, and many more people turn out to cheer them on. READ MORE: Terror at Boston Marathon: 3 dead, scores wounded "We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon," said event commander Chief Supt. Julia Pendry. The Metropolitan Police have "a wealth of experience in policing a wide range of public order events across London," she said. The London Marathon organizers said Tuesday the event "will go ahead as originally scheduled." "We have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the Metropolitan Police and other authorities," a statement on the event website said Tuesday. Chief executive Nick Bitel said: "We want to reassure our runners, spectators, volunteers and everyone connected with the event that we are doing everything to ensure their safety." The organizers said Monday they were deeply saddened and shocked by the news from Boston. "Our immediate thoughts are with all the people there and their families. It is a very sad day for athletics and for our friends and colleagues in marathon running," they said in a statement. London is the next, after Boston, of the six races that make up the World Marathon Majors series. The course, which starts in southeast London, passes through some of the capital's main business districts before finishing near Buckingham Palace. More than three-quarters of those taking part will raise money for charity. 'Robust security measures' "The bombings in Boston are shocking, cowardly and horrific, and the thoughts of all Londoners this morning will be with the victims," London Mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. "Boston is a proud city built on history, tradition and a real sense of community. These attacks were aimed at its core, at innocent men, women and children enjoying a spring day out at a major sporting event. "We do have robust security measures in place for Sunday's London Marathon, but given events in Boston it's only prudent for the police and the organizers of Sunday's race to reexamine those security arrangements." CNN anchor Piers Morgan tweeted: "London marathon this Sunday - security at these events will never be the same again."	1

Known for building skate parks and shaping the skateboarding scene in New York, Andy Kessler, 48, died this week after an allergic reaction to an insect sting, friends and family told news media. Andy Kessler, seen in 2005, reportedly died this week after suffering an allergic reaction to an insect sting. Kessler's death is a reminder that stings can be deadly for those with an allergy to certain insects, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology said Friday. At least 40 people in the United States die each year as the result of insect stings, the academy said. As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization. In a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department. "It's common, but not incredibly common," he said. Typically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories In the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York. Capes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine. Even if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said. Those who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.	1
Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd. It is hard to believe the 6-week-old, dwarfed by her human keeper, will grow up to  be a 1,800-pound bull cow. But she looks strong and will be the largest in the group this year.There was a time, maybe seven or eight years ago, when I used to think I would never take that role. Then, in April, a calf was born to a 4-year-old ewe. She was the biggest thing I had ever seen or heard of, and she looked like she could do anything. She was a dream.I took that feeling that my life was incomplete until she was born into a life that was incomplete. It became my responsibility to complete it by raising a cow who could fill that role.But first came a season of trial and error. Her calf-raising phase.I took time off work and moved my family into an old farmhouse. After six months of labor, I decided to become a full-time dairyman. My only experience of milking was a class in college; I had to learn the ropes the hard way. I bought the first cow to come to me.I felt like I had to make her a full-blood, because she looked like a half-blood. I had to make her a full-blood because, while I did not see a great deal of a distinction between the two breeds, I knew there was a huge difference in the way they cared for a sick calf and how they cared for a calf that had a life-threatening sickness.The difference is not in the blood line. It is in the mind and how someone views the role of the dairy cow.When I met her, I saw a cow that was not capable of nursing or caring for any calf who showed symptoms that could kill them. I needed to find a way to get a good life, and part of that was to take care of a calf I could nurture with the love of my life — my daughter, Leah.Our first cow to become a full-blood was a Holstein-Friesian cow, bred with three other rams. One after the other came into her herd; and then my next full-blood was a	0
The detained captain of a Chinese trawler was released by Japan and returned to his home country, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Zhan Qixiong, who had been held by Japanese authorities  since his arrest last year, is an experienced captain.The Associated Press contributed to this report.A U.S. Navy veteran and a U.S. citizen were arrested and held for three days in China on espionage charges, a U.S. official said, as a U.S. aircraft carrier, its carrier strike group and multiple ships moved to a nearby naval base Monday.The two were arrested at a port in Fujian province while trying to fly from China to the Philippines, and were later released after being extradited to the U.S., the official said.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the arrested Chinese man was an American citizen, but did not release his name. The other was a U.S. Navy veteran, who is not an American citizen, and was arrested at a port in Fujian province while trying to sail from China to the Philippines, and was subsequently released by local authorities, the official was told.The official said the two had been working for a Chinese military group that provided intelligence about U.S. military activities, and said they were suspected of being agents of the Chinese government.The incident marked the first time a foreign-flagged ship was ever detained in the disputed South China Sea, which has been the source of longstanding tensions between the U.S. and China.The Navy's Seventh Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan, was working with other U.S. and Japanese forces in the area because of territorial and military disputes with China, an American official said.The U.S. Seventh Fleet was working with Australia and Philippine naval forces, as well as the United States Coast Guard, the official said.Tensions and the evolving territorial dispute over the South China Sea reached a fever pitch in early June, when the Chinese Coast Guard intercepted a U.S.-flagged ship, the John S. McCain, in the disputed waters off the Paracel Islands, according to a U.S. official. The official said the U.S. government had notified Japan of the situation.The U.S. Navy said the John S	0
It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military  action is his best option for the crisis in Syria. His proposed mission is unclear. He offered no details. (Read full text here.)The timing was notable. Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, met with foreign counterparts earlier that night at the White House to give them the option of sending ground troops to Syria, according to an administration official and two people with direct knowledge of his involvement.When asked about the letter, House Speaker John Boehner said that he was following the president's lead."I will support our president's action when I see where it takes us, but what I think the president's doing is to lead," Boehner said. He added that the United States has many challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that "we have a chance here in Syria to be a force for stability."In his letter, Obama wrote that "it is clear" that the current options in Syria are not "working and that Russia and the Syrian regime have thus far defied a U.N. Security Council resolution and continued to use weapons that kill civilians." He said any action against the Syrian government, "whether by military force or by economic sanctions" could produce "the type of a civil war" that "would bring Syria and the region to the brink of catastrophe."Obama has previously said U.S. ground troops would be involved in the intervention, but he has also avoided making a commitment on the mission at the moment.In his letter, Obama called on Congress to set up a fact-finding effort and to consider a resolution to authorize military action. He also asked Congress to allow the deployment of more U.S. anti-aircraft weapons in the region.The letter comes as an apparent escalation of the ongoing U.S. military incursion into Syria, which has resulted in at least four civilian deaths and more than 200 injuries, according to a tally by the United Nations.The U.S. is already deploying a number of additional American weapons to Syria, including Patriot anti-missile systems, and other advanced military equipment, which the Defense Department says will help protect American personnel and increase the capabilities of allied Syrian allies.In a	0
One of the Internet's great promises is that it's the ultimate democratizer. It's open to everyone and allows all people to communicate. Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches. But, so far, there have been several hitches in that plan. Not everyone has access to a computer and a broadband connection. Some governments still censor the Internet. And of course, we don't all speak the same language. For the World Wide Web to be truly global, shouldn't Chinese speakers be able to chat online with people who only speak Spanish? And why should an English speaker be barred from reading blogs written in Malagasy or Zulu? Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks. The two online giants are going about the process in different ways. Facebook aims to translate the Web using an army of volunteers and some hired professional translators. Meanwhile, Google plans to let computers do most of the work. Which method will ultimately prevail remains to be seen. But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work. (Feel free to add your own Internet translation tips -- and fun translation bloopers -- in the comments section at the bottom of the story): Facebook's human translation Many tech bloggers think Facebook's method of human translation seems promising. After all, the American-born social networking site introduced non-English languages for the first time only in January 2008. Now about 70 percent of Facebook's 300 million users are outside of the United States. How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan. They suggest translated phrases and vote on translations that others have submitted. These crowd-sourced edits -- which work kind of like Wikipedia -- make Facebook's translation service smarter over time. Go to Facebook's translation page to check it out or to participate. Size: More than 65 languages function on Facebook now, according to Facebook's statistics. At least another 30 languages are in the works, meaning Facebook needs help working out the kinks on those languages before they're put to use.	1

But there's a key element that sets the iPad Air apart: the new Retina display.I had high expectations for the new display on the iPad Air. When Apple first announced it in April, I was skeptical because the display was said to be "Retina," which meant it would be bigger and more pixel-perfect than the iPad 2, the previous iPad.But the iPad Air is just as sharp as the iPad 2. When I saw the iPad on store shelves, I was disappointed to see the display was only slightly sharper than the iPad 2, because the iPad 2 didn't have the new Retina display.Here's the truth: The Retina display is great. It's the best display Apple has ever produced. That's the one thing Apple must change with the iPad 5th generation: Make the screen less sharp, and make the pixel-pushing more accurate. Yes, the iPad 5th generation will now support the highest-resolution Retina display Apple has ever made.The iPad 5th generation also looks great. The rounded corners, the slim bezels on the top and sides, the silver back and glossy white finish look great on the new iPad. The new iPad doesn't feel any different than the iPad 2, which means there's no reason not to buy it.So, in the end, I believe the iPad Air is a great deal. If you're looking for a device that looks great, works great, costs less than most tablets and has a Retina display, then the iPad Air is for you.Pulse: What's the big deal about the new iPad Air?	0
David "Kidd" Kraddick, whose morning radio show aired in nearly 100 cities, has died. He was 53. He died Saturday in New Orleans at a golf tournament to raise money for his Kidd's Kids Charity, his management  said. He's survived by his wife, Kim, and their daughters, Briana and Ella. He was a former music publicist."We all love and miss David," his management said. "He was a friend to so many people."Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxA few weeks ago, his management confirmed that he had been diagnosed with a heart ailment. On Sunday, his manager said the illness was an enlarged heart. The publicist added that Kraddick died as the result of a medical emergency.Kraddick was a longtime music publicist who worked at the Billboard offices in New York. He gained attention in 2004 after he began performing the now-famous "P.S. I Love You" at the Grammy Awards and later "P.S. I Still Love" during the telecast to raise funds for orphans in Uganda. He has since done the same during Grammys ceremonies and at other events. He also performed for troops overseas.Kraddick's management said he was diagnosed with heart complications after a doctor prescribed medication. He underwent surgery to remove plaque from his heart and receive a defibrillator.He was reportedly hospitalized briefly after the surgery, but was stable and released on Saturday."He was an artist who touched people in incredible ways," said Bill Werde, his agent until October.Kraddick is survived by his wife Kim, his daughters Briana and Ella, and his brother, Paul.His publicist said in a statement, "We are all heartbroken by David's passing. He was a gentle giant in a world that loved him and he will be truly missed."His management said that he had recently finished recording an album that is expected to go to stores this summer.Survivors include his sister, Nancy Kraddick-Barkley, and brother Thomas Kraddick.A recording of the "P.S.

French scientist Francoise Barre-Sinoussi almost didn't get the chance to make one of the greatest medical discoveries of the 20th century. She shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with her colleague Luc Montagnier for identifying HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, a plague that has killed about 35 million people since the 1980s. "Never before has science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity," according to the Nobel committee. Because of their discovery, scientists quickly developed a test for the virus. Their discovery also led to the development of drugs that dramatically increased the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. But had Barre-Sinoussi listened to one leader at the lab where she would eventually find fame, she may never have been a scientist at all. Natural aptitude Barre-Sinoussi has loved science since she was a girl. But coming from a family of modest means, she decided to forgo a more expensive medical school to take the research route at the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris. But she says she ended up spending little time in class. "This is not the advice I would give young people. University is important," she warns. But she had another interest: She had fallen in love with lab work. About two years into her studies, she grew tired of the theoretical. She wanted to test her mettle in a lab. "It just was not done at the time, but I wanted to try," she says. After dozens of rejections, she reached the famous virologist Jean-Claude Chermann at the Pasteur Institute. He made her an unusual offer. "He said, 'OK, if you want to be a volunteer here part time, that would be fine with me,' " she recalls. She loved it immediately. "Suddenly, I understood that's what I really wanted to do." Her research then focused on the same family of viruses as HIV. She worked to find a connection between retroviruses, cancer and leukemia in animals. Friends shared their class notes so she could study late nights and weekends while spending full days at the lab. Incredibly, she passed her exams with top marks. She stayed at Pasteur and earned her doctorate.	1
The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide. A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods. But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats. Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction. "The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand," a Red Cross bulletin said. Bangkok's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate, with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. "We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground," said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. "Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded," said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. "The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad," she said.	1
and hotly disputed -- air defense zone above the East China Sea on Thursday, the same day that Japan's military firmly insisted its own patrols over the area wouldn't stop because of Beijing's declaration. The People's Liberation Army Air Force flew warplanes, including Su-30 and J-11 aircraft, into the "air defense identification zone" that Beijing announced last week, air force spokesman Col. Shen Jinke said. A KJ-2000 -- an airborne radar early warning system -- also took flight. The Russian-developed Su-30 is a two-seat aircraft described by its manufacturer as "a highly maneuverable fighter" capable of hitting ground and sea-surface targets. The Chinese-made J-11 is a single-seat fighter also capable of ground attacks. The fighter jets conducted "routine air patrols ... aiming to strengthen monitoring on air targets in the zone and fulfill the air force's historic mission," Shen said in a statement posted on the Chinese defense ministry's website. Jinke portrayed the mission as a "defensive measure ... in line with international practices." China's military has been on "high alert," he added, and is prepared to act "based on different air threats to firmly ensure air-defense safety." What comes of Beijing's latest foray over its controversial newly created zone remained to be determined early Friday. Still, some of its previous actions -- including the declaration itself -- have been met with staunch resistance by Japan and its longtime ally, the United States. On Thursday, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation's Self Defense Force has used ships and planes to patrol and conduct surveillance in the East China Sea since before China claimed the air defense zone that covers much of the sea. And they wouldn't stop, he insisted. "We have no intention to change this operation in consideration for China," Suga told reporters. "... We will continue the surveillance/patrol operation with strong determination to protect our territory against China's one-sided attempt to change the status quo by force." Japan isn't alone in disobeying China, which has warned military measures could be taken if planes entering the zone fail to identify themselves and submit flight planes to Chinese authorities. Two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers recently flew through the area in what the U.S. State Department characterized as a planned military exercise. War of words	1
Making a cell phone call while aloft could become a reality under a proposal by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Cell phone calls, texting and other mobile services would be allowed when the aircraft are flying above 10,000 feet, but not during takeoff and landing, according to an official briefed on the proposal. Airlines would have to equip planes with special antennas approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration before passengers could start talking. The commission says this proposal aims to give airline passengers the same communication access in the air that they have on trains and buses or in coffee shops. What should become of Airplane mode? "Modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely and reliably, and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules," FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. "I look forward to working closely with my colleagues, the FAA and the airline industry on this review of new mobile opportunities for consumers." For years, the FCC has banned talking on mobile phones aboard aircraft in flight due to concerns that high-flying phones could disrupt cellular towers on the ground. A proposal to lift the cell phone ban was considered in 2004 but abandoned three years later. At the time, the FCC said that the "technical information provided ... was insufficient to determine whether in-flight use of wireless devices on aircraft could cause harmful interference to wireless networks on the ground." A number of other nations around the world already allow cell phone use inflight on similarly equipped aircraft. FAA allowing most electronic device use throughout flight In a 2012 study, the FAA collected data from 11 countries and concluded that "civil aviation authorities reported no confirmed occurrences of cell phones affecting flight safety on aircraft with on-board cellular telephone base stations." The commission is considering the proposal because passengers want it, but some surveys show passengers are split. In a survey conducted in 2012 by Delta Air Lines, 64% of passengers said the ability to make phone calls inflight would have a negative impact on their onboard experience. The current proposal will be discussed at the FCC's December 12 meeting and could then be opened for public comments.  The commission would have to vote on a final rule before it could take effect. If the FCC gives final approval,  individual airlines could choose whether to provide mobile service to passengers.	1
Even though the Ryder Cup prize ceremony took place at Medinah long after the sun had set, the staggering nature of Europe's triumph eclipsed the gloom -- and left many golf fans wondering how the ersatz Ryder Cup could ever produce this much drama from a relatively small event.It is understandable that England, which won the first three matches, would have to wait until Wednesday for the first tie breaker between the two teams.In reality, as has long been the case, the European teams have no advantage at all in the final playoff: the points from the top two finishing teams from each section will be combined to determine the winner.A record crowd of 39,000 turned out for the Ryder Cup in 2010, marking five straight years of crowds of at least 30,000.

It's the beginning of the second semester in public schools across Nigeria and students are flocking back after the vacation. But in most of Borno state, the heartland of the militant group Boko Haram, the desks are empty and the playing fields are quiet. Western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on Chibok Girls Secondary School. Only the walls of the classrooms, library and science laboratories remain: a charred shell of what was once, the pride of Chibok. But even more painful is the fact that more than 200 of the girls who took classes here are still missing, kidnapped from the school during that night of terror. Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school. Since the attack he's kept them at home, where he felt they would be safer. "I am scared of sending them to school," he says. "I'm not feeling good that they're at home and I'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks." Muvia's dilemma mirrors that of almost every parent in Chibok: torn between education for their child and their family's safety. On the way to Chibok from Abuja, the country's capital, travelers meet one police or military checkpoint after another. But join the main rough dirt road to Chibok and the government security presence seems to taper off. It all leaves local residents feeling vulnerable and afraid. Muvia couldn't forgive himself if he sent his daughter to school and then heard that something had happened to her. "No one can afford losing their daughter," he says. In an article on his website "Education for All" Gordon Brown, the U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education, says 10.5 million children in Nigeria are yet to go to school and that the high levels of illiteracy are now an economic problem, as well as a social disaster, for the country. Analysts say that if the Boko Haram attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase, further compromising the future of the country's young people.	1
When Barbie burst onto scene in a black and white swimsuit in 1959, she was considered a rebel who embodied both "the sensuality of Marilyn Monroe and the innocence of Debbie Reynolds." Now, she's returning to her "fashion model"  roots, for which she was famous, but is now more in line with this new, modern-day Barbie."To have a real and honest to goodness doll that does everything your imagination can possibly want, right down to the hair—she has the same kind of personality as you or me and can sing, dance, cry and laugh just like us," says Barbies creator and writer Barbara Ann Teer.A doll of the same size and proportions as Barbies has been on the market for a decade. According to the National Retail Federation, by 2012, the Barbie brand was expected to make more than $7 billion in sales. For the first time last year, the company said its revenue topped $6 billion, meaning it has surpassed its previous best.And the company is still growing: A Barbie doll has been named the top-selling doll at Toys "R" Us stores.Barbie, as you may know, is based on an animated 3-D character created by Mattel in 1958 and who was voiced by Barbra Streisand.Fittingly, the doll has a new, contemporary voice actress."She seems so much younger now, more down to earth," says Teer. "She had this Barbie voice all along that always seemed to me perfect for this girl who was always looking for advice. And that voice, the young, upbeat voice, is totally out of sync with the way Barbie is now. I feel very close to a lot of people who are not Barbie."The "I" in Barbie and her older self, as well as Teer's own voice artist, has a British accent. And with her new, younger look, she is an entirely different Barbie in many ways. "She's a beautiful, petite, pink Barbie who wears a cute mini dress and has a very feminine hairstyle," Teer says of this new version. "She has more of an adult attitude. She won't cuddle as much. She plays with her toys in a grown-up way. And she has a more natural voice."In the meantime, we're going to see more of this new Barbie doll,	0
Could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses? The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ while the two were in the throes of feeding, according to a news release. The photo was sent in by a researcher from the U.S. Geological Survey. The seal was also seen sitting on its back end in what appears to be a sitting position.Seymour Hersh's book about the Watergate break-in was first published in October 1973, as was his 1975 book, The Black Book. I remember reading them, as a kid, as a book for school and for summer reading. They inspired a lifelong admiration for Hersh. In both books, Hersh explores the life and times of Richard Nixon, focusing on the various conspiracies that surrounded the first U.S. President's White House years.If you were there at the time of the Watergate break-in, especially the last time, you may be aware that something is really, really wrong with the narrative:In the late 1970s, the Watergate scandal first broke and then intensified to the point where President William Jefferson Clinton and his lawyer, John W. Dean, resigned in shame over their role. The truth is that Watergate was never about the break-in and cover-up. The real scandal is why and what Nixon did--a story that has never been told before.In this exclusive excerpt from his new book, Seymour Hersh writes how a young White House aide named Larry O'Brien, who had taken over the Oval office after Nixon fired his secretary, was able to take control of the story, and then, with his friends in the media, he worked to suppress the crucial evidence that exposed the scandal.O'Brien took a key position with Watergate Special Assistant and future New York Times reporter Carl Bernstein. Bernstein had been approached by a friend in the White House, Donald Rumsfeld, who was known among friends inside the administration as "the president's right hand man." Bernstein was, at the time, working on the biggest story in the nation's history: the first Gulf of Tonkin Incident in the 1960s, a U.S. intelligence report of an alleged North Vietnamese attack on U.S. vessels off the coast	0
After nearly 40 years of recorded increases, the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008, recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show. The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased,  and the number of foreign-born residents in the country declined.The Census Bureau’s annual immigrant population data has been available for eight years (since 2007). However, the numbers available in the last few years have been less reliable because of continuing population estimates that have taken into account the natural growth in the immigrant population.Numbers and StatisticsSince 1975, the U.S. immigrant population has grown almost fourfold to 11.1 million  in 2007. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, in this year only one new immigrant will be added to the population.The number of native-born citizens grew by 6,100 to over 2.6 million in 2007, and more than 3.2 million of the increase was due to naturalization.Although the annual percentage change in the number of immigrants is a positive number, it is not statistically significant and should not be read as an actual increase. The U.S. Census Bureau stated that it is unable to determine whether the change is statistically significant because of the large sample size.In 2007 there were no new immigrants living in the United States and a decline of 1,700 immigrants from the previous year.By the most recent data available, the growth in the foreign-born population in the United States has been much more sluggish. Between 2007 and 2008, the number of foreign-born residents dropped by 11.1 million people, or 3.1%. The rate of growth for the foreign-born population decreased from 2.9% to 2.4% of the population.However, the absolute decline in the population is still significant because the population increases and declines are not the same. The number of new immigrant residents was virtually the same in 2004 and 2005 as in 2000 and 2001. The number of native-born residents actually increased by more than 100,000 in 2000 and 2001.The decline in the number of foreign-born residents is not as high as the decline in the immigrant population. The increase in the number of foreign-born residents (both documented and undocumented) was the third highest after the immigrant population and the naturalized citizen population.	0
Editor's note: The FBI has one more opening on its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Tune into CNN's "Campbell Brown" at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday to find out who fills the final slot. Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list. EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Eduardo Ravelo is described as a "ruthless killer" who has gone to great lengths to avoid law enforcement while contributing to the bloodshed that terrorizes the border between Texas and Mexico. Authorities say the suspected hit man with close ties to the Juarez drug cartel has shaved his head, undergone plastic surgery and even manipulated his fingerprints to elude capture. He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say. He keeps a low profile, living modestly. On Tuesday, Ravelo was named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, taking the second of three vacant slots.  Watch the FBI discuss Ravelo's alleged crimes » Officially, he's wanted on federal racketeering charges, but the FBI says Ravelo's criminal activities run much deeper. He is believed to be responsible for dozens of murders and assaults, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, weapons offenses and money laundering, FBI Agent Samantha Mikeska said.  Watch the latest on Ravelo » "He has no respect for human life," she said. Mikeska is leading the hunt for Ravelo, who goes by the nickname "Tablas," which is Spanish for wooden plank.  He's also called "Two-by-four" and is believed to be  hiding with his wife and children, probably in a Barrio Aztecas-controlled neighborhood in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. "Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said. Barrio Aztecas started as a Texas prison gang in the 1980s. Federal authorities say the profits from drug sales are often transferred to the commissary accounts of gang members in prison.	1
At the American Music Awards on Sunday, there was plenty of love for international artists. British boy band One Direction was a big winner at the 2014 ceremony, taking home both the artist of the year award  and the international group award.But the night could have been better for a little known Canadian band, whose album entered the Billboard 200 album chart at number 2.The band’s self titled album topped the charts in the U.S., U.K. and Canada for three weeks in its first week of release.Last year on March 30, The Globe and Mail’s music critic Rob Sheffield published an article titled “The Canadian Group That Made It”. In the article, he discusses the band, who had yet to perform in Canada at the time of the story.“For nearly four months after winning the award at the 2014 American Music Awards, The Vamps had yet to touch down in Vancouver to perform in an event so major that its organizers had designated a whole block of blocks as the stage,” he wrote.He also noted that they were originally scheduled to perform at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California, but had to cancel that as the band was preparing its album for the upcoming March 28, 2014 release.The album, which made it into the Billboard 200 album charts at number 2, stayed off the charts for three weeks, making it the longest out of any of the week’s top ten albums. The album debuted in the top five on the US Billboard 200 Chart at number 5 with a release date of April 11.He goes on to say that the group’s name has become a synonym for “glam”.“The Vamps (not to mention the British band that came up with the group name) has had its own way of getting people to like them,” he writes. “The Vamps was the brainchild of British producer Mark Ronson, who wanted to release a self-titled album by a British boy band in the US.“Ronson’s original idea was for The Vamps to release a seven-inch single and tour, but when he started going to the American Music Awards he knew he couldn’t afford to pay most of the performers and couldn’t afford to do it himself.

Pope Benedict's butler has been arrested on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to an Italian journalist, the Vatican said Saturday. Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday for illegal possession of confidential ernica, or papal papers, police said. His lawyer said he was in Spain. ernica, or the Holy See's documents, are classified and non-disclosure agreements prohibit most media from revealing details of the documents. ernica or papal papers can give insight into life under the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, who was beatified in 1995 and now has a shrine in Rome.LONDON (AFP) - Pope Benedict was greeted by an ecstatic crowd of 1.25 million people when he made his way through the streets of central London at the weekend, a crowd estimated at an estimated 35,000 and growing by the minute. The crowds began gathering as early as 8.30am (1200 GMT) Saturday, and the crowd numbered 20,000 by noon, according to the Associated Press. Among those on hand were children, who were the largest group."The number of people who watched the Pope's procession was unprecedented in the history of Roman Catholic churches," the Holy See Press Office said in a statement. "The pope's procession was a truly cathartic experience... that brought the faithful to their feet," the statement said. Some 5,000 police were kept inside the St Peter's church as the crowd filled the streets. It was the largest gathering of Catholic faithful in Britain since the Vatican opened their gates to Pope John Paul II in 1979.Pope Benedict and his train will be arriving at Kings Cross Station in London at 7.30am.The Pope has previously made it clear he doesn't care about England and its people, he has a massive ego and he's a total self-made man who will take you by the throat and squeeze until it hurts you.You can tell why he thinks the UK is his 'home'.He didn't even visit Australia which has a very large British community.You can't just come from America and think he will be a huge fan. He's the first American Pope.You can bet your bottom dollar that he will be greeted with huge cheers when he arrives in the UK.You can also bet his ego will get the better of him and he will not be received like a king on the English throne.	0
A New York teenager with a 7,000-a-month texting habit now has a lot more to text about. Brianna Hendrickson, 13, of Brooklyn won this  year's LG U.S. National Texting Championship by accurately typing the phrase "Old McDonald had a  farm, Ei, ei, oh! And on this farm he had a champ. W/a txtr here, and BFF there.  Here a text, there a text, erywhere a text-text!" in 60 seconds. Brianna took home $50,000 and will compete in the LG Text For Good  Challenge, where she will have the chance to double her prize money and  win an additional $50,000 for a charity of her choice, the technology company said. "I was really nervous when I saw the final phrase and worried my fingers wouldn't be fast enough," Brianna said. "Hearing my name announced was amazing and shocking all at the same time." The final showdown pitted Brianna against two other teenagers and 48 year-old Joanne Rach from Chicago, Illinois. Rach won LG's national texting competition for parents and caregivers. Finalists who competed in New York City had already messaged their way through preliminary competition, such as on-site texting challenges at concerts, text alerts on TV shows or texting from online tournaments. They endured blindfolds, complex phrases and marathon texting during the competition this week. About 500,000 texters participated in preliminary rounds of the competition this year, LG said.	1
A southwest Illinois man accused of strangling his wife and two young sons appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to murder charges, officials said. Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Ã¢ÂÂ he is charged with three counts of murder Ã¢ÂÂ in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (Sarah Ravani/Chicago Tribune/TNS)Christopher Coleman was arrested on Feb. 10 after his wife's body was found in a bathtub with her throat slit, police said.Police say the 46-year-old was upset over an incident he claimed was a “hate crime” — an accusation he also made earlier this month.“He came to my doorstep ... claiming he was being stalked” by the mother of his children, his wife’s cousin, a relative told WGN-TV.Police said on Feb. 8, Coleman had confronted his wife of 11 years, a mother of two, about an event that occurred on January 27 at her home.After threatening to go to police, his wife told him to leave and never come back, WGN reported.The next day, she received a text message from her uncle, identified as “John,” who told her to come to the kitchen to prepare a turkey dinner for her children, WGN reported.A short while later, the two heard their son’s car pull up outside and then saw him rush out of the house.“He ran from the basement. He ran into the backyard, and he fell backwards out of the window,” another cousin told the TV station.Coleman is facing charges of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of aggravated domestic battery, and one count of armed violence, police said.The Cook County State’s Attorney’s office said it is continuing to investigate the crime and ask the public for assistance from the public as possible witnesses.“We are getting all the facts, and we will proceed,” Assistant State’s Attorney Laura Healy said.	0
Larry Smith's desire to make sure he's alive to watch his grandchildren grow up was his light bulb moment. "I was on the path to not living old and this bothered me," he said. "I want to live long enough to see my young  grandfathers grow up and have families of their own. I want to live long enough to see my grandkids out of high school and into college. I want to live long enough to see them into the real world, working and saving and planning for the rest of their lives."Smith passed away in his sleep Tuesday, June 13, at the age of 87. He was suffering from congestive heart failure and dementia due to multiple myeloma, which is a form of cancer that strikes the bone marrow. He was surrounded by loved ones and friends and in pain. "The doctors had just completed his annual physical in late May, and it was at that point that doctors and family members knew that life was short," said his sister, Patricia Smith. "He did not see the day he died as a very sad end to such a wonderful life." He leaves a wife, two children, three grandchildren and two great grandchildren."I'm not going to lie, when I first heard the news I didn't know how to feel," Smith's personal assistant said. He then told the man's son, "We're talking about someone who had a vision and a mission for the next 50 years to change the world one day at a time," his son added. "He used his life to spread love in a way he would have never dreamt he could.""We're all so grateful for the life he lived. He was so much bigger than his ills and we all looked to him for so much guidance." - David Smith (from his family, through a representative)"I had to call my mother in Florida, but then thought I'd better not.

It's an early Christmas for Madonna fans. The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album "Rebel Heart" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet. Early mixes from the Queen of Pop's 13th album had been leaked, and longtime manager Guy Oseary asked the public to help find those responsible. Madonna fired back by officially releasing six new tracks Saturday morning, which are now up for sale on iTunes. In a tweet, the singer wrote, "Happy early X-Mas!" and linked to where people go could to purchase her new songs. The tracks available immediately for download include "Living for Love," an upbeat anthem, "Devil Pray," a haunting composition, "Ghosttown," an emotional mantra, "Illuminati," an electronic orchestra of melodies, as well as two other songs. Madonna took to Instagram this past week, thanking fans for not listening to the tracks floating around online. "Thank you for not listening! Thank you for your loyalty! Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world," she wrote in her post. Earlier this month, the singer posted a photo of her smashed iPod on Instagram after discovering the leak of her track "Rebel Heart." In her post she wrote, "This broken ipod is a symbol of my broken heart! That my music has been stolen and leaked! I have been violated as a human and an artist!" Leaks have tormented Madonna in the past. In 2003, the singer's website was defaced and every song off her "American Life" album was leaked online. Rolling Stone reported that Madonna had wanted her newest single, "Living for Love," to be released on Valentine's Day, with the rest of the album coming out in spring.	1
With moist eyes and soft voices, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges on Wednesday related to years of using campaign funds for personal expenses that included purchases of Michael Jackson memorabilia Ã¢ÂÂ including black-velvet tuxedo suits and one for Ã¢ÂÂ and for personal care for their children, according to CNN.Jackson, a Democrat from Baltimore who was first elected in 1988, was charged in what federal prosecutors described as a corruption scheme. He was convicted by a jury on the third attempt, after former Rep. Charles Rangel was convicted on two counts. Jackson said in a statement issued via CNN, "I will continue to fight for the people of Baltimore and the country I love."In his statement, Jackson called his actions Ã¢ÂÂan abuse of power Ã¢ÂÂ and a betrayal of the American people.Ã¢ÂÂJacksonÃ¢ÂÂs wife, Deborah, was also charged in the case Ã¢ÂÂ along with Rangel and a longtime political aide at the Justice Department, Michael Rothaus; JacksonÃ¢ÂÂs attorney, Robert Wolf; and two other aides to the former congressman, who prosecutors said were cooperating with the investigation.After news broke on Wednesday that Jackson was to be sentenced, several of his former aides issued statements in defense of the former congressman."Mr. Jackson has made it clear that he will continue to fight for those who canÃ¢ÂÂt, even as a fraud conviction sends him to prison," said Rangel`s attorney, Tom Quirk. "We appreciate Mr. Jackson sharing his story with the public, but his convictions are a result of decisions he made and actions he took while in office and before.""The guilty verdict in this case is a vindication for Mr. Rothaus, who went to great lengths to protect Mr. Jackson from the consequences of his actions," said his attorney, Scott Rosin."The government chose to prosecute Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Jackson accepted responsibility for his actions. All of his actions, past and present, were in good faith, and were in the name of those who elected him," said R	0
State Department analysts raised questions about the psychological state and health of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, according to a December 2009 cable recently published by WikiLeaks. The analysts were curious about the "interpersonal dynamics" of the president and her husband Nestor Kirchner, who was also his wife's immediate predecessor as president. The cable, which was sent from the secretary of state's office and signed by Hillary Clinton, said that the analysts had "a much more solid understanding of Nestor Kirchner's style and personality than we do of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner," and wanted to develop "a more well-rounded view" of the then-president's personality. Among the questions put to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires was a series about President Fernandez de Kirchner's mental state and health: how she managed her nerves and anxiety, how stress affected her behavior toward advisers and decision-making, whether she was on medications, and how she calmed down when distressed. The cable also asked about President Fernandez de Kirchner's approach to dealing with problems, and whether she shared her husband's "adversarial view of politics." It also asked about how the Argentine first couple divided up their day and on what issues each of them took the lead or deferred to the other. The 2009 cable also asked about the health of former President Kirchner. He died of an apparent heart attack in October. President Fernandez de Kirchner was elected to office in October of 2007, at the same time then-Sen. and former first lady Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election in the United States.	1
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Wednesday it will donate $50 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. More than 2,200 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the outbreak has been concentrated. Cases have been diagnosed in Senegal, Nigeria and Uganda."This is an immense investment in a major public health challenge by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation," said Bill Gates, co-chairman of the foundation. "It's our way of helping a small country like Guinea get the health services it needs and to prevent the spread of Ebola to other countries."The $50 million represents a fraction of the health department's overall emergency medical equipment needs for the three countries. But it represents an extraordinary contribution."The world needs to make clear that it wants to get Ebola under control," said Dr. Peter Piot, director-general of the World Health Organization. "There's no excuse for this to take place in the international community."The foundation has already contributed millions of dollars this year to help. Last week, it committed $14.5 million to the American Red Cross to help with medical care for victims, and pledged to support Ebola response efforts in Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.The current outbreak began in December 2014 in Guinea. The initial focus has been in the capital city of Conakry, where over 2,000 people have been infected and more than 400 have died. The city now serves as the epicenter, but the health department said it expects the virus to spread to other districts over the next month.Officials in Liberia are also reporting a rise in new cases and deaths."This is a global public health crisis that requires global cooperation," Gates said of the current outbreak.The Gates Foundation said it is also seeking other ways to support the fight against Ebola, including partnering with the World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development through a new initiative, the Ebola Emergency Operations Center.The foundation said it does not have any plans to move the Gates Foundation's Ebola response fund away from the United States."We hope that in time we will have more information about this disease, and about how this outbreak might end," Gates said. "We're committed to helping any country that requests our assistance, and we're going to keep doing both of those things."The foundation's $50 million is to	0
When Guatemalan laborer Faustino Morales fell from a scaffold in February, the response from volunteer firefighters was immediate. Within minutes, the "bomberos" reached the accident site with advanced rescue equipment, an urn and a casket, and began to help with the rescue efforts."They gave me water and I took some, and we managed to move the urn over, and the casket," Morales tells IPS. "I said to my son 'I want to know what happened, I want to know why this happened to me.'"With the help of the firefighters, Morales was able to survive two days in the hospital before his life was saved at 5 a.m., Thursday, from a stroke he had suffered in February.The incident in Guatemala, which was caught on camera by citizen journalist Jorge Perales, was recorded just months after Morales was injured while working on a building site.Perales, who uses the stage name Julián Dominguez, first began to document the injuries that had been inflicted on Morales. He says he was inspired to take photographs after two of his friends were electrocuted while working in similar conditions.The firefighters helped Morales to walk to the hospital. He had suffered an injury to the back of his head as well as a compound fracture of the right leg. "They brought me there in an ambulance but I was not able to walk," Dominguez tells IPS in the first video on his blog.Following the incident, Morales and his cousin were helped by volunteer firefighters to move to the hospital. He had suffered a stroke.In February, Morales received a third stroke when workers carrying heavy machinery tipped him off balance on a scaffold and fell. The third stroke was caught on video by Perales."His [Morales] last words are a cry: 'My life is over,' said Julián Dominguez who captured the video, which has been distributed by various websites."The firefighters are thanked for their efforts, and Morales is placed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital for emergency surgery.In this video, Perales describes some of the physical injuries Morales had suffered as a result of his work as well as the mental illnesses that have plagued him for years. Dominguez describes his friend as a "compulsive person" who has "suffered greatly because of his job	0
Since the start of the financial crisis, the world's wealthiest man, investor Warren Buffett, has been front and center. Alice Schroeder says investor Warren Buffett has become a symbol of stability in American business. He's advised Sen. Barack Obama on economic policy. He urged Congress to pass the $700 billion bailout bill. He bought stakes in Goldman Sachs and General Electric. He wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times saying he's buying stock in American companies now because he believes they will do well in the long run, citing as his rule: "Be greedy when others are fearful." Buffett's name came up in the second presidential debate when the candidates agreed he'd be a good choice for treasury secretary. His fortune was estimated at $62 billion by Forbes in March. Alice Schroeder got Buffett's cooperation in writing her new book, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life" (Bantam Books). Schroeder, who worked on Wall Street as an insurance industry analyst, met Buffett 10 years ago when his company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought a big insurance company. Schroeder says she suggested he write a book about his life, and the 78-year-old Buffett turned the tables, urging her to do it instead. Schroeder estimates she spent about 2,000 hours with Buffett and interviewed 250 people for the book. Now on a tour to promote her book, Schroeder is in a unique position to speak about Buffett at a time when many media outlets are seeking his views. "I have about 300 hours of recorded interviews and the rest of the time I observed him, I watched him make decisions and talk on the phone, went through files. I got to sit in his office for weeks, I ate steaks with him," says Schroeder, who's 51. "If it ever said moo, he'll pretty much eat it. He likes his steaks bloody rare and hanging off the plate, they're so big." CNN: Why are people so interested in Warren Buffett? Schroeder: I think he's transcended business to become a national figure because of people's trust in him as a symbol of stability and a symbol of someone who knows how to manage risk and avoid catastrophe and of how to run a business on principles. CNN: Is there any realistic possibility of him taking a government position?	1
Yes, Americans are stressed over the economy. A new poll finds that Americans are sleeping less because of economic stress and demands of modern life. Our day seems shorter, schedules are crammed and precious sleep hours are sacrificed -- Â if you're a parent. We are all adjusting to modern life and there's not enough sleep!We've been hearing for months about sleep deprivation. The federal government's report for July found that people were spending more time sleeping than they were making up. That is why sleep deprivation is a major issue for Americans. It is a serious health matter, because so many of us are chronically sleep deprived. But the American Sleep Association has reported that our 24-hour work days and longer school days may also be contributing to the stress of modern life.The American sleep expert has found that we work harder and longer than we realize -- from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. most days -- and this is affecting our sleep patterns.The survey found that one important factor is the sleep debt -- the extra 8.5 hours of sleep that we are not getting from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.According to poll numbers, Americans are sleeping less. The survey, which was conducted by Harris Interactive for Businessinsider, showed that one-third of those polled said their bedtime was not consistent with their needs. Thirty-seven percent said their working schedule was interfering with their sleep. The poll of 1,000 adults found that only 31 percent of adults use more than the recommended eight to nine hours of sleep every night. One thing is clear: more time to sleep means more time to be a good parent."The survey findings were shocking," said American sleep expert, Dr. Michael S. Grinspoon, M.D. "We are sleep deprived in America. We sleep less with an increasingly busy work schedule."So, it is a serious matter. We have to be realistic about the time that we are spending in bed. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other government sources, the average American adult gets about seven to nine eight-hour days each year -- far too few to be a good parent, a spouse or a good worker. That's why sleep is becoming a major issue in our society and Americans have to get their priorities in order.The study was also looking at the sleep habits of those who are considered as "short sleep	0
Country music artist John Rich had such a great time in Las Vegas that he was not fit to fly home to Nashville on Sunday, according to Southwest Airlines. Rich, 37, was escorted off a Southwest flight before it took off from Las Vegas Sunday night, airline spokeswoman Christi McNeill said Monday. "Our crew assessed the situation and determined that the passenger was not fit for travel," McNeill said. It was not clear what led to Rich's getting booted from the plane, but the singer's spokeswoman Tree Paine denied online reports that he was involved in a fight with another passenger. "Did John Rich have a great time with his fans in Vegas? Yes. Was there an altercation? Absolutely not," a statement said. Southwest gave Rich -- of the band Big & Rich -- and a fellow traveler a refund and they found alternative travel arrangements to Nashville, the airline spokeswoman said. "Our employees are responsible for the safety and comfort of everyone on board a flight," McNeill said. "If we can mitigate an uncomfortable situation prior to departure, it is our preference to do so, and that is what happened in this scenario." CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.	1

Taliban militants, who implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week, have now taken control of a neighboring district. Protests in Karachi against the creation of sharia courts in Swat Valley. Here ÂoM is a volunteer of the local Islamic human rights organization, MQM.Islamabad, Pakistan – A Pakistani woman has become the first transgender woman to be ordained as an iman, a religious Islamic scholar in the Muslim world who gives religious advice and rulings, in the Swat valley.The court-led religious ceremony was held on Tuesday outside a mosque in Bannu, a district in the centre of the northwestern Pakistan, where militant Islamic militants took control of two months ago.The ceremony, attended by hundreds of local supporters, was also attended by the first transgender woman to be ordained as an iman, the community’s self-proclaimed religious leader who will act as a mediator between the Taliban and other local Islamic scholars.“The person who will guide us as the iman is from the community, but is not of it,” she told GlobalPost about her role as the iman, who will guide the region’s local scholars in religious rulings.The ceremony has been widely criticized for excluding those who did not hold the community’s religious convictions, and that the ceremony ignored the women and girls who have been subject to female genital mutilation and physical abuse in the area.Shabana, who was attending the ceremony through the help of the local civil society organization Adwa, rejected criticism and said, “I want to remind that this is an educational ceremony and not a religious ceremony.”“We need to understand that it is impossible for the Taliban to impose any religious views and beliefs on the people in the region,” she said.When asked about female genital mutilation, she said, “It will be discussed in greater detail later.”When asked about how she will be able to mediate between conflicting views about the community, Shabana said that any issue that does not involve politics will be discussed in a separate forum instead of a religious ceremony.Shabana’s role as an iman does not go unnoticed and has been criticized by many for her views.“The community demands that she be one of	0
Melissa McCarthy is one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood right now, so it's no wonder that Elle magazine named her one of their top 2013 "Women in ____". But despite her stellar career, McCarthy doesn't feel like she's the only one who's been left out."I think people forget I have sisters, too," says the 31-year-old. "If they haven't noticed that, they are clearly not my demographic. I’m just not the kind of person who looks for people like me, especially in the way that Elle has defined me as a kind of woman."While Elle has been very open about the fact that their survey is, in fact, only asking a population of actresses and actresses-to-be — an impressive feat of research, you'd think — we're still left wondering: Why does Hollywood still cast so many people like Elle?The actress and the writer aren't exactly surprised by the data. "I don’t think it’s that complicated: I think the roles and the way we’ve been treated for so long has been incredibly sexist and the roles that were supposed to be women and were supposed to be white have been just a way for them to get by, period," says McCarthy.So we wondered: Are the roles that Hollywood actually wants women to play still the types of roles that aren't really the way they're being treated?How Elle, and Hollywood, has changed (or hasn't)When Elle magazine first started publishing, almost a decade ago, it was one of the few places where women of color would have the opportunity to be the lead or featured star in a magazine — or even just the featured woman. It was almost unheard-of for a woman to play a lead role in a mainstream film.With the rise of streaming subscription services and the explosion of social media and celebrity, as well as an influx of women of color into the entertainment industry, it seemed that something new was on the horizon: The possibility of an actress playing the lead role in a blockbuster film."It’s almost like we have this idea within Hollywood that women of color and women can only be in supporting roles, or that women should only be a supporting actor, or that women who are actresses like myself should be limited by the fact that we’re actresses," says McCarthy	0

There are few more concrete examples of the longtime rift between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland than the walled city on the River Foyle. Its official name, and the name used by most residents of the UK, is Londonderry.  The walled city is, however, an urban area known as Derry in spite of the city being on the other side of the river, and has an official name of Londonderry since the late 19th century. The walled city, which has a population of over 250,000, is the capital of Northern Ireland and houses the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Queen's University of Belfast and the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Derry is divided into four districts by the wall, named after the four districts of Derry, which were known as the old counties of Derry (north), Londonderry (south), Armagh (middle) and Tyrone (west) in the Plantation of Ulster; all four districts are now contained within Londonderry. In 1997 the population of the four districts was estimated at 5,400.HistoryEarly historyDerry was founded by Queen Elizabeth I while she was on a tour of Scotland and Ireland, with the intention of establishing a colony. The exact dates are unknown, but the first inhabitants are believed to have arrived in 1178. In around 1209, a charter was granted to Edward I by the Scottish king James IV, which granted the city the right to build a wall and to defend its borders. Originally, Derry was merely a walled town in the middle of the six old counties of Derry, Armagh and Tyrone, the other four formerly being part of the barony of Moy and were known as the counties of Armagh, Armagh & Tyrone, Aghalee and Carrick respectively.For the next seven hundred years there was little significant change until the advent of Protestantism.ReformationThe Protestant Reformation in Derry, which began in the early 1600s, has gone down in history as one of the most turbulent and confusing moments in Irish history. The Protestant Reformation is, in part, due to Catholic resistance to the Penal Laws, which the Protestants believed were an infringement of their religion. This resistance was led by the Catholic Derry MP, Michael O'Nale, who was eventually hanged in 1603. The Catholic parish of Knock	0
A controversial Kansas church says members will picket before the memorial service Wednesday evening for two Florida teenagers allegedly killed by their mother. In a press release, Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, said it will demonstrate outside the service in Tampa because the mother is a military wife and "the doomed American military declared war on God & His church." The controversial church and its pastor, Fred Phelps, have made their name picketing near funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people and soldiers. The church plans to picket beginning at 5:15 p.m.and ending at 6 p.m., when the service is scheduled to start, according to CNN affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa. Julie K. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths Friday of her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx, and her 13-year-old son, Beau. She was denied bail at a court appearance Monday, a court spokesman said. Her husband, Army Col. Parker Schenecker, is with the U.S. Central Command, which is headquartered in Tampa. Police told WFTS that he was in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar when his children were killed. King High School, which Calyx attended, and Liberty Middle School, where Beau was a student, are sponsoring the service at First Baptist Church of Temple Terrace in Tampa, the church said. Josh Saliba, director of creative ministries, told CNN he would not comment on Westboro Baptist's plans to protest. On Monday -- their first day back since the shootings became public -- students at Liberty Middle School wore blue and black in memory of Beau, who was an eighth-grader there. CNN affiliate Bay News 9 posted a statement Monday from the Schenecker family: "Colonel Parker Schenecker has returned from his deployment and is grieving with family and friends. He is devoted first and foremost to honoring the lives and memory of his beautiful children, Calyx and Beau," the statement said. "Parker and his family have been touched by the overwhelming support from the community both near and abroad. Arrangements and details are still being finalized with regard to the services to be held for Calyx and Beau." A search warrant filed Tuesday said Julie Schenecker was unconscious and wearing a bloody robe, and her slain children were covered in blankets when police arrived.	1
Two Florida school administrators face contempt charges and possible prison time for saying a prayer at a school luncheon. Pace High School enacted a decree in January banning officials from promoting religion at school events. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School, and Athletic Director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a non-jury trial September 17 before U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers. The statute under which they are charged carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison, subject to sentencing guidelines. Attorneys defending Lay and Freeman call it outrageous that the two are being prosecuted for "a simple prayer." But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains that students have a right to be free from administrators foisting their religious beliefs on them. Still, an ACLU representative said the organization never suggested that people should go to jail for violating the decree.  Watch why lawyer thinks men did nothing wrong » The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that "school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events," according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9, under which district and school officials are "permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events," the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. On January 28, "Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School," according to court documents. "Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members." Attorneys from Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman, said in a written statement that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project, all "consenting adults." In a February 4 letter to district Superintendent Tim Wyrosdick in which Lay acknowledged the incident, he said that although past football booster club members "and other adults associated with the school system" were at the luncheon, culinary class students were in charge of food preparation and serving.	1
The estranged wife of the man accused of kidnapping then-14-year-old Elizabeth Smart from her family's Salt Lake City home in 2002 testified Friday that the defendant manipulated her into doing things by saying his orders were divine law. "I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences," said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell. Mitchell played to his wife's strong religious beliefs, telling her that divine revelations required she carry out acts that included participating in the kidnapping, she said in her second and final day of testimony in her husband's trial. "I was told that we were commanded to take 14-year-old young women and we were to snatch them out of the world and train them up in the ministries of God," said Barzee. She is serving a sentence of up to 15 years after striking a plea deal last year with state and federal prosecutors for her role in the abduction and agreeing to testify for the prosecution. But the prosecution did not call her, the defense did. Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she "demonstrate sexual activity" in front of Smart, said Mitchell. "He never expressed any remorse about kidnapping Ms. Smart, did he?" Prosecutor Francis Viti asked. "No," Barzee responded. Barzee said she helped Mitchell in his meticulous preparation for Smart's abduction, from setting up the bucket that the girl was to use as her bathroom to setting up the tent in which the girl was to be raped. "I was told that I needed to listen to the plan of my husband," she said. Asked if that meant she "needed to be submissive and obey?" Barzee responded, "Yes." Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly. One such attempt involved a fellow church member named Kelly who was eight months pregnant with another man's child, said Barzee, who added that she agreed to Kelly becoming another wife to Mitchell. Mitchell ultimately ended the marriage with Kelly for reasons that Barzee said were unclear. An attempt to recruit a shoe store worker named Julie to become one of Mitchell's wives failed, she said.	1
Today's selection of Boeing and SpaceX as the providers of a U.S.-based capability to take humans to the International Space Station (ISS) is a major milestone in the almost six-decade history of space exploration. It is just the latest sign that the old paradigm of government-only space travel is being replaced by something else -- a new business ecosystem composed of novel relationships among NASA and the aerospace industry. No longer will NASA own the ISS "trucking company" -- specifying every nut and bolt. Instead, NASA is buying services from U.S. industry. To be sure, the new announcement made it clear that NASA will be carefully examining the safety aspects of each design. But the designs will still be those of Boeing and SpaceX and vetted by NASA. I believe this new approach is America's "secret weapon" in what some have described as a space race with China. And, as far as I can tell, while the rest of the world is still stuck in a nearly government-only mode, NASA, with the support of the Obama administration, is letting loose the creativity of American know-how. Beginning with the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition, continuing with the Commercial Resupply Services (cargo) and now the Commercial Crew selection, NASA "bet the farm" on commercial companies filling the gap left by the retirement of the space shuttle, with the Commercial Crew companies (SpaceX and Boeing) replacing the Russians in bringing NASA astronauts to the ISS. This will allow NASA to invest the savings in deep space capabilities such as SLS and Orion. I believe it is critical that both commercial cargo and crew succeed for at least two reasons: First, NASA's proper role can be summed up in three words: "Explore Deep Space." It is time for NASA to turn over the low Earth orbit work to industry while NASA focuses on getting humanity to Mars, following in the tracks of robotic rovers Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. Second, history teaches us that without a trailing edge of commercial exploitation and profitability, exploration as large scale, routine human endeavor will not succeed.	1
A 14-year-old Filipino-American boy abducted in July by suspected Islamic militants in the Philippines is free, officials said. Kevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without iautomatically saying when he would return home.Lunsmann's family was notified of the decision Monday afternoon in a phone call to his family. She was to pick him up at the U.S. Embassy in Manila at 7 p.m., a statement from the embassy said.The U.S. Embassy said it would release more information when it knows more about his location."He is extremely grateful for the help that authorities have been providing," the U.S. Embassy said in the release. "He can't wait to get home and continue to look for a good job in the U.S. and take over his dad's business."His mother, the statement said, "is hoping to bring her son back to the United States in the near future."The State Department said it was aware of the development and was monitoring the situation in the Philippines.Lunsmann, previously an U.S. Marine Corps combatant with the 2nd Marine Logistics Group, was abducted by unidentified gunmen in the southern Philippines in July as he and a friend were exploring a cave for the chance to drink water.His friend was able to reach police by cell phone, an NBC news report on the incident said at the time.Since then, the family has said in interviews that they had been contacted by the family of a man they believed was Lunsmann and that he had come home, but had disappeared.Lunsmann is being held and possibly tortured by Abu Sayyaf Group, a militant group seeking the Islamic state's territory in Southeast Asia, and the terror group, which has declared it will attack the U.S. and its allies, said it would take Lunsmann back.The Philippines says he is being held with three other foreign hostages.The U.S. has asked local police to speed up their investigation, but the U.S. Embassy in Manila said late Monday the investigation is continuing. The embassy also offered assistance to the U.S.The White House said last week that the U.S. had received information about Lunsmann's apparent abduction and would send a	0
The mini-civil war that we've seen play out in the Democratic Party over the past few weeks isn't just a case of a dispute about tactics. It's a sign of a deeper division. Former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Obama and  participated in the convention in Tampa, has argued that the party needs to rekindle its identity as a champion for ordinary people and for workers.During my travels in the early part of this year, I talked to a lot of Democratic activists. They were proud that they ran, won and governed as Democrats, yet they felt the party went too far to the left after the 2008 debacle, leaving them on the sidelines. They wanted the party to make a real effort to reconnect with them and their concerns. They were tired of the left wing's agenda of tax increases and health care mandates. Many had come to resent Obama's emphasis on social issues (gay marriage) and his focus on young voters in key states.Now, the DNC is trying a new tactic. When the New York delegation met with the Obama campaign in mid-October, DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced that the party's presidential nominee would be chosen by a national convention of party leaders, not the elected caucus in each party's state or district convention. At the convention, she said, "The future of this party, as we envision it, lies in the hands of the delegates who will ultimately select our nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia next summer."For the past decade, many Democrats have believed that their party has gone too far to the left; they were looking for a moderate alternative, who would try to broaden the party's appeal to a broader spectrum of voters. The results would have been the same if the DNC had chosen a presidential nominee at the regular caucus conference, in the hopes of attracting more moderate Democrats out of the party's swing states who might feel left out by the left-wing candidate, for example. In this sense, the DNC's effort is a retreat from its own principles.Not only did the DNC make concessions to the Obama campaign, but it also offered an un-Democratic-like concession. At this point, the Democrats are offering to nominate Obama, but they are not offering support or even enthusiasm for his candidacy. The nomination must be unanimous.This is a major setback for the party, but it is not the final word. The DNC has the right to	0
faster, higher, stronger -- two Russian thrillseekers traveled to China to put at least one of those to the ultimate test by scaling the as yet unfinished Shanghai Tower in the city's financial district. The climbers were the same men who made headlines last year when they scaled the Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments. They recorded their exploits in Shanghai with forehead-mounted cameras, and the resulting footage, which shows their adrenaline-fueled journey from break-in to summit, is breathtaking. The video, uploaded to video sharing site Vimeo, shows two masked men wearing hoodies talking urgently in Russian as they scope out the boarded-up construction site, before slipping in. Under the cover of darkness, they make their way up to the roof of the skyscraper. The climbers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, aren't new to this type of extreme freeclimbing. Their blogs show images of climbers clambering over sites including buildings, mines and dams across Europe, the Middle East and Central and East Asia. Makharov's blog shows a climber with a camera atop one of the pyramids outside Cairo. Raskalov told CNN that he was "not scared" when climbing this kind of structure, although it was an "usual situation" for him to undertake this kind of climb. Peering over the side, the upper floors of the distinctive, 492m Shanghai World Financial Center and the neighboring Jin Mao Tower (421m) can be seen in the video, peeking through low lying clouds. From their vantage point on top of the unfinished building, Raskalov and Makharov look down on the skyscrapers -- the height of the new construction dwarfing its neighbors, which had previously dominated Shanghai's skyline. Undaunted, the pair then swing out onto a crane and continue clambering skywards. Cutting back and forth between the daredevils as they ascend the crane, the wide angled cameras show the yawning chasm beneath their sneakered feet -- neither man appears to wear any safety gear. Upon reaching the very top of the crane, one examines his hands, grimy from the long climb, and the pair high-five each other before taking the ultimate Facebook profile pic - one unlikely to ever be replicated.	1
Even when working at his father's gas station when he was a boy, Baz Luhrmann had an eye for great stories. "The gas station itself was like an island, and the variety of humanity that would stop, each person had a story... whether there was a family arguing, whether there was a love affair or Christians trying to convert people," he told CNN. Luhrmann has gone from observing those road-side slices of life to making big screen hits, like "Moulin Rouge" and "Australia", and made a name for himself as an imaginative filmmaker with an eye for the spectacular. "As a little kid in the middle of nowhere in a tiny country town, I had no problem ... imagining the big story, the big myth, the big adventure. I just go, 'Wouldn't it be great if...' and I always think that'd be easy, that wouldn't be a big deal, that wouldn't cause a stir. Next thing I find myself going down that road, causing a stir, people saying, 'how experimental'." His breakthrough film "Strictly Ballroom" grossed $80 million at the box office, but until it became a surprise hit of the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, it had been rubbished by distributors in Australia. The turnaround came when he secured a midday screening for the film at Cannes. "The following morning we held the record for the most number of sales ever in Cannes by an independent film... and it's a bit like when a moment like that happens, my life has been kind of like a holiday that I've never come home from."

Esquire magazine published   a glowing story about how Mary  W.   Brown and her colleagues were   preparing a new, much needed   schoolhouse  for the children of the unemployed. No one really knew the  children, but now these children could become  the backbone of the school.  The magazine asked Mary Brown what they  should do with the children. Mary  Brown thought about it. She said, “Just let them go.”  So, she wrote a letter  to every child she could find. It read:  “Dear Child,  I am writing to you that you  can have the new schoolhouse.  And you can go to school.  I have a very special place for   you, in that new schoolhouse. It   has a special carpet. It is as soft   as butter.  And it has a special table. And it  has a special stove. And it has a  special stove.”  You can imagine that the children  loved this letter. Soon a hundred children  packed their bags and off they walked.  They went to the new schoolhouse. They   had beautiful furniture. They had  a teacher with a special name   on her door. And they had a teacher    who had a special name on her door  who taught them about kindness.  And then  those children went back to their  homes. There were children who  weren’t happy. Why did they stay  back? Because they   were always afraid to go to school.  But the other families were happy. Theywere happy that those children got into   school. Because  those children were the future of   this country.  They were going to build the economy,  they were going to build the way   we think, they were going to build   our society. And they were going to	0
The U.S. Army's official history of the Iraq war shows military chiefs made mistake after mistake in the early months of the conflict. Iraqis watch as a statue of Saddam Hussein is toppled in Baghdad in 2003. Failures to adequately train Iraqi security forces caused the country to fall into chaos. Then there was the decision to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq.But the U.S. Army's official history of the war in Iraq offers one moment of clarity: "There was never a moment when the Army truly came under fire."The U.S. Army's official history of the Iraq war offers one moment of clarity: "There was never a moment when the Army truly came under fire."The Army is finally addressing a serious problem that has vexed the war effort for years.More than three years after the Army publicly acknowledged the fact that it had failed to develop and adequately train Iraqi security forces, the Army is finally addressing a serious problem that has vexed the war effort for years.On February 11th, the Army published its official history of Operation Iraqi Freedom, its Iraq-only campaign that began in 2003. The Army described what it called a failure to "adequately train the Iraqi security forces."If you believe the Army, the failure contributed to the chaos in Iraq that followed. If you believe the Pentagon, the failure was justified by the threat Iraq posed to U.S. troops and their Iraqi allies.The Army's official history confirms that the two accounts are very different.As the Army made clear, the failure was not to develop an army of Iraqis but a army of soldiers. During the war, the Army trained, equipped, and commanded tens of thousands of Iraqis in a variety of roles.The Pentagon, on the other hand, acknowledged the lack of an Iraqi army was a major flaw in its plans to train and equip Iraqis. U.S. officials also acknowledge that the collapse of Iraqi security forces during the initial months of the war was a byproduct of the training deficiencies, not the primary cause.The two views of the failure were reflected in a two-hour congressional hearing on March 18th. During testimony, Army Colonel Jeffery L. Crane, who led the effort to develop and train the Iraqi army, testified that his organization missed a crucial training opportunity. That opportunity was the selection of Iraqi officers who	0
On Saturday he was the comedian-in-chief, cracking jokes with reporters and celebrities at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. On Sunday he oversaw one of the riskiest special forces operations since Desert One, Jimmy Carter's ill-fated attempt to rescue the American hostages from Iran more than three decades ago. Barack Obama isn't just the president. He's the nation's ultimate multi-tasker, juggling enough roles and responsibilities to make the average person's head spin. Over the last month and a half, Obama held at least five National Security Council meetings to help plan the assault on Osama bin Laden's compound. The days in which those meetings were held coincided with, among other things, an education reform speech, two political fundraisers, a discussion with the Japanese prime minister about that country's nuclear crisis, a long-awaited deficit reduction speech, and two meetings on immigration reform. The day before the last National Security Council meeting -- on April 28 -- the "birther" controversy came to a head. Obama made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to release his long-form birth certificate. (Yes, he actually was born in Hawaii.) And in the midst of all the planning, the president cut a deal with congressional Republicans to narrowly avert a government shutdown. He also dealt with a series of devastating storms in the South. Has this always been par for the course at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Not really, according to Boston University presidential historian Robert Dalleck. The frenetic pace of the presidency is largely a reflection of America's role as the premier global power in the post-World War II era, Dalleck told CNN. Harry Truman dealt with countless domestic crises during the Korean War; LBJ tackled the Great Society and civil rights while fighting in Vietnam. But in recent years, he said, the daily pace has accelerated due to the rise of the internet, wireless, and other facets of the communications revolution. There's a "kind of blinding rapidity" in which one event quickly overtakes the next, said Dalleck. Our attention -- and that of the president -- is whipped from the latest economic crisis to the newest tornado wreckage to the latest protest or outbreak of violence in the Middle East. Faced with a pressure for constant response, modern administrations face times "of great pressure and intense demand over a series of compelling issues," he said.	1
Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Dublin on Saturday to remember a woman who died after being refused an abortion and to demand a change to the country's laws. Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital on October 21 complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time. The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but denied her an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband has said. Halappanavar died of septicemia, or a blood infection, at the hospital. Chanting "never again, never again" protesters marched to government buildings and held a candlelit vigil in Dublin. Vigils were also held other cities, including Galway, where Halappanavar died, and outside the Irish Embassy in London. "I'm here today to stand up for women's rights. And I think the government should legislate and stop messing around," said Patrick O'Neill, a protester. Abortions laws in Ireland are strict and terminations can only carried out in exceptional circumstances. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never been enacted into law, meaning there is little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion can and can't take place. It is this Supreme Court ruling that some Irish people now want made into law. Gerry Adams, leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein political party, has said it's time for the government to legislate for abortion in certain medical cases. Other politicians have called called for an investigation into Halappanavar's death. Her death is "particularly tragic and harrowing, and shocking to all concerned," said Irish opposition lawmaker Micheal Martin. He has called for an independent inquiry into the case "with personnel from outside the country to participate on such a panel of inquiry." The Irish government needs to "establish the full circumstances" of her death, he said. The government has said it will launch an investigation, but details, including who will lead it, remain elusive. The government has said it will include the Halappanavar family in the inquiry. The hospital expressed sympathy to Halappanavar's husband, and noted in a statement that "the facts of this tragic case have yet to be established."	1
Formula One drivers will face tougher penalties for improper driving in the 2011 season, while race stewards will have more power to hand out sanctions. Stewards were already able to issue drive-through and 10-second penalties or a drop of any number of grid positions, and they will now be able to exclude drivers from race classification and suspend them from future grand prixs. The changes were released by ruling body the FIA in the wake of last Friday's World Motor Sport Council meeting in Monaco, at which the 2011 regulations were set. The FIA also released details of driving practices it considers improper, including more than one change of direction when defending track position. It also announced that backmarkers -- cars at the rear of the field who have been lapped by faster drivers -- will have to move aside for leading racers, or face being reported to the stewards. F1 bosses drop ban on team orders Another change for the forthcoming season is the introduction of a curfew on team personnel, which will prevent mechanics working on their cars through the night on a race weekend. The curfew will be between midnight and 6 a.m. ahead of practice on a Friday and between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. before qualifying on a Saturday. Each team will be allowed to break the curfew on four occasions throughout the season. The 2011 season will begin with the Bahrain Grand Prix on March 11-13.	1
It's graduation day and professor Jonathan Jansen strolls around the campus of the University of the Free State. Every now and then he stops to greet his gown-clad students, standing out amid a crowd of beaming  students."This is the moment when we all start seeing ourselves in other people," he says.As graduation day approaches, Jansen is busy with the students."I have to do research on my final paper," he says.Jansen, 28-years-old, is a PhD student at the University of the Free State and a part of a student union called the University Workers' Support Network.He's been at the university three and a half years, and this is his sixth year as a member of the Union Committee."I wanted to do this as far as being in the union; it's an interesting job and, by the way, I'm also a member of the student parliament."And there, he says, he knows of what he speaks."We have this student parliament which is more like a discussion board than a parliament, but I mean the way you can really get a lot done is because people from all over the country meet there, because their problems and their concerns and their thoughts can get across very quickly through student parliament. That gives you that opportunity."The University Workers' Support Network says it is a student union that has been open to all students and that is committed to working with all students."We want to make our union open for everybody," says Jansen."We want to make sure our union is the largest union of all universities and that we have a big impact because we talk to each other as well as students."The University Workers' Support Network is currently at the forefront of the struggle for a living wage for  universities and universities' unions.Jansen, a member of the University Workers' Support Network, says it is important to give all students the opportunity to fight for a living wage and decent working conditions."It's my obligation to give students the information."Jansen says that for students to be able to fight for a living wage and decent working conditions, it is necessary that students have access to union membership and the ability to be involved in the process of forming their union."We have a union in one of the student unions	0
George H.W. Bush turns 90 today (June 12), only the fourth American president to reach that age. He's the last of the World War II presidents, the last American leader to preside over the Cold War, the last  president who held the nuclear codes, and the only  president ever to be shot. For the first time, these are more than just passing events for him, but part of the story of the man he has been.Bush, who died Saturday night, at age 94, was the third most powerful man in America after Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Yet he is also the least well-known politician in his home state of Texas, largely because the White House has not been able to fully focus on his presidency. And while he never met his father, George Bush, the war hero who helped make him president, Bush was more than proud of his father's service, according to a 2012 letter published in the Huffington Post. The son wrote to his father in August 1944 thanking him for his service in World War II.In it, his dad tells him that the war was "the most exciting time of my career...the most exciting time of my life." It was a quote that resonates with many who watched his father's presidency, from the time he was a member of the Texas House to the time when he entered the White House as 40th president.The war was a good time to be a young man in Texas, said Michael Reynolds, a professor of history at Rice University in Houston. "A lot of people say, 'It was the most exciting time of his life,' and they don't feel comfortable with that," according to the Huffington Post. "Bush was an easy person to like. He gave you the time of your life, and you're not going to question him...He had plenty of time to himself."Even so, he says, it's not all roses, and the war was a time for Bush to be a young man. "He was not very successful at school" which can be traced to the fact that his father fought in the war in the Navy. He went to Texas A&M, where he graduated in 1941 with a degree in political science. But upon graduation, the Second World War began.George Herbert Walker Bush, the only son of George Bush senior, grew up in the Texas oil boomtown of Midland, where his father first	0
Cameron Russell aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time. In March, she helped launch Interrupt magazine, initially a webzine, so these other perspectives can join in the media vernacular.When I became a full-time writer earlier this year, one of the things of which I was keenest to keep on top was my own professional standing because I was afraid of the power and influence of those I admire. I wanted to be in a position where I could be as free as possible from the need to please as much of the readership as I could. I’d been at the magazine and publishing house for two years, and that seemed like enough time to try and find my own voice.I started writing about women in the workplace, and what struck me was that women are almost universally more likely to be dismissed, bullied and discriminated against than men. So I asked myself: where is the opportunity for me to make that point, make that statement, make that suggestion, give my voice that power? I realized I was a writer. I am a writer. But I am also a woman. So, where is the intersection of my being, my experience, my life?It was a huge challenge to find the place where the media were making space for more diverse voices. I realized I could get there by putting women at the center of who I wanted to write about. The first piece I wrote for Interrupt was a profile of Julia Galbraith (see video).For seven years, I’ve been writing about women and work, but when I first started writing about women in the workplace, there were very few, if any, of them. So it was just a question of ‘where are they’. And I think we’re all too often not just talking about women in the workplace, but about women in general.I have been lucky enough to get to be a writer in the last seven years, and I’ve learned so much from each piece I’ve written. And I would say that, while I’m still learning, I have made a point of writing about women I admire.Women who inspire me the most are all from diverse cultural backgrounds. They’re all multi-talented. They are all different and unique. They all have their reasons for doing what they	0
Telephones are ringing off the hook at this office in Mexico's capital, where a group of well-known activists are planning the final details of a protest on the other side of the Mexico-U.S. border. In a month-long Caravan of Peace across the United States, organizers say they will denounce what they believe are the devastating consequences of the fight against drug trafficking. San Diego, California, will be the first stop on Sunday for poet Javier Sicilia and 70 other members of Mexico's Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity on their trek through more than 20 cities in the United States. Along the way, 40 people whose family members are among the tens of thousands of dead and disappeared in Mexico's drug war will speak out about their experiences and work to create a new network with more than 70 U.S. nonprofit organizations. "We want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the United States as in Mexico," says Sicilia, who became one of Mexico's most prominent activists after his son's slaying in March 2011. The caravan will stop in sites north of the border that the poet considers key -- including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago and New York -- before arriving in Washington on September 10. "It will not be easy to cross the cultural divide to discuss subjects like drug legalization, the illegal production and sale of weapons, trafficking of migrants and money laundering," Sicilia says. And the protest's timing is another challenge, Sicilia says, noting that his group could struggle to gain attention during a fierce election campaign between incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama and his presumptive Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Still, he says he is confident that host organizations in the United States will help them create "a narrative that can sensitize the U.S. population about these problems." The tough political climate, the intense waves of heat sweeping the country this summer and the large distance to cover -- more than 5,800 miles (9,400 km) -- have inspired Sicilia to describe his upcoming journey across the United States as an "odyssey." For the mystical poet, who has become a key player criticizing Mexican President Felipe Calderon's strategy to fight organized crime, the caravan through the United States is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son's slaying.	1
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that she intends to move ahead with a vote on a resolution that labels the deaths of more than a million Armenians during World War I as genocide. The resolution has strained U.S. relations with Turkey and drawn criticism from the Bush administration. "This resolution is one that is consistent with what our government has always said about ... what happened at that time," Pelosi said on ABC's "This Week." When asked about criticism that it could harm relations with Turkey -- a key ally in the war in Iraq and a fellow member of NATO -- Pelosi said, "There's never been a good time," adding that it is important to pass the resolution now "because many of the survivors are very old." "When I came to Congress 20 years ago, it wasn't the right time because of the Soviet Union. Then that fell, and then it wasn't the right time because of the Gulf War One. And then it wasn't the right time because of overflights of Iraq. And now it's not the right time because of Gulf War Two. "And, again, the survivors of the Armenian genocide are not going to be with us." But White House Spokesman Tony Fratto said bringing the resolution to a vote "may do grave harm to U.S.-Turkish relations and to U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East." Turkey's top general warned Sunday that ties with the United States will be irreversibly damaged if Congress passes the resolution, The Associated Press reported. Turkey has recalled its ambassador from Washington for consultations and warned of cuts in logistical support to the United States over the issue. The recall is only for a limited period of time, said a U.S. State Department official who talked to the ambassador. "If this resolution [that] passed in the committee passes the House as well, our military ties with the U.S. will never be the same again," Gen. Yasar Buyukanit told the daily Milliyet newspaper, according to AP The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 27-21 Wednesday to approve the nonbinding measure, which declares the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923 was "systematic" and "deliberate," amounting to "genocide." The deportations led to the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million people.	1
Heavy fighting between Somali militants and African Union peacekeepers in Mogadishu, Somalia has left at least 19 people dead and 71 others wounded, according to a local ambulance group. "What happened today was a horrific tragedy, the shelling was continuous and it was hitting a populated area of Bakara market where people were unwitting, so it was appalling many people lost parts of their body and were screaming," said Ali Musa, director of the amblunce group in Mogadishu. Musa said his group collected 19 died bodies and 71 people with wounds. "The fighting started 5:30 a.m. and continued into afternoon so there was absolutely fear and chaos in Mogadishu," he said. Meanwhile, government spokesman Abdirisaq Mohamed Qeylow claimed that government forces pushed Islamic insurgents out of some areas. "We have pushed the militants back and our forces have reached Howl Wadag intersection near Bakara Market," said Qeylow.	1
Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride. Athletes' victories on the global stage made us proud of the new China. The new ersatz China.There is no doubt that China has long been a sports country with a rich history of both traditional and innovative sports. There is also no doubt that most Chinese sports fans have long supported the country's sporting system.The country's sports system has always been far from perfect. There have always been sports in China that have been banned, and have been fought for their inclusion. In 1978, for example, some Chinese football fans protested the national team's participation in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina only to see China fail to qualify for the tournament.The first Olympic Games were hosted by China in 1900 but, for the most part, the country has lagged behind in sports innovation.Yet the country's sporting infrastructure and its national pride are still strong, and have allowed China to have an identity as a nation with national pride.When China first hosted the Olympics in 2008 in Beijing, the country's sporting system was still in its infancy. The fact that China was the only one in Asia to participate had raised the expectation that Chinese athletes would perform well.Yet those expectations were quickly shattered during the team's preparations, when the country's sports officials discovered that the national team contained many talented athletes from the country's countryside.In the end, China did not even make the podium in London this summer, and the team's coach, Wu Lei, was removed by the Olympic Committee and banned for life.It did not help that China finished fourth in the medal table, with only 56.5% of the country's 1.3 million athletes participating in the Games.Despite these and other sports controversies, the country's sporting system seems to have achieved its primary goal: developing a new sense of pride in the country's sports. When we look at China's sports system now, it is clear that the system has not only played an important role in creating such pride in the country, but has also helped China to become one of the world's fastest-growing sports.So what will the future look like in the case of the Olympics?In the past, the most likely scenario was that the Chinese Olympic Committee would simply add new sports to	0
Israel's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the plane "was identified while attempting to infiltrate Israeli airspace in the Golan Heights." Israel used a Patriot anti-aircraft missile to bring it down, the IDF said. Military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the aircraft shot down was a Russian-made Sukhoi-24 and that both the pilot and co-pilot ejected into Syria. The plane penetrated roughly a kilometer (more than half a mile) into Israeli airspace, he said. Syrian state TV also reported that Israeli forces had shot down a Syrian warplane. Defense Minister: We will act strongly The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra, where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located. Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the Syrian fighter jet "came close to Israeli territory on the Golan Heights in a threatening manner, and even crossed the border line." He said Israel would use whatever means were necessary to protect its citizens. "We have made it clear, and we are making it clear now as well: We will not allow any factor be it a country or a terror organization, to threaten our security and violate our sovereignty. We will act strongly against all attempts even if it is a mistake or intentional." Border area called 'Highly unstable' An IDF statement posted online said the Israel-Syria border had been "highly unstable" in recent months. "As the civil war rages in Syria, IDF forces have experienced combat in the region, both from targeted strikes and errant fire," it said. The incident came as the United States and a number of Arab allies began bombing ISIS targets in the Syrian town of Raqqa, far to the northeast. U.N. forces withdrew last week from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others. Al-Nusra Front freed 45 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji in good condition earlier this month, while forces from the Philippines escaped after exchanging fire with militant fighters, according to media reports.	1
Nathan Cox-Reed has a toothache. He thinks he needs a root canal, but the full-time student, 22, is uninsured. He can't afford a trip to the dentist. "I'm only working 30 hours a week. I wouldn't have enough money  either to pay for the toothache or to get money together to pay for a root canal," he says. "It'd be easier to get a root canal without insurance," he says.It's not that Cox-Reed's parents don't pay attention to their son's medical costs. They just don't know he's uninsured. "I've never given this a thought until recently. My parents would just pay for everything. But my stepdad is sick," he says.Uninsured kids have a tough time paying for healthcare: Only about one-third of them have insurance, compared with a majority of adults. And when they can't pay, even for basic services like dental care, they are left to wait in long lines at public clinics and try to balance their checkbooks with food stamps.But the situation for some uninsured toddlers — particularly those less than one year old — is even more dire. Uninsured children are four times as likely as their older counterparts to have no healthcare coverage.As they grow older and get a greater understanding of the medical system, parents can try to negotiate for their children's healthcare coverage."If you take care of your kids, it makes things better for kids too," says Dr. Robert Weisman, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "If anything, it makes them smarter. We know our uninsured kids are at a disadvantage in this country, because they're less likely to be covered by universal healthcare."If kids receive adequate healthcare coverage, they are better able to fight off illnesses without medical bills and to live longer, healthier lives. They are also less likely to die of asthma and other diseases.Dr. Weisman says pediatricians who specialize in newborns have a unique set of responsibilities when it comes to helping young patients obtain coverage: To ensure care is covered, and to monitor these patients to make sure they are following up with the appropriate provider, they must call doctors off the list of potential care providers for these newly insured children."I was recently in the pediatric practice of a single family in a nearby suburb to assess a	0
Breaking news update 12:09 a.m.] There have been at least four confirmed deaths from Tropical Cyclone Phailin, Amitabh Thakor, deputy inspector general of Brahmapur, Odisha, told CNN. Three were killed Saturday; a fourth was confirmed dead Sunday. Local police told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees. [Last update at 10:24 p.m.] In morning light, India assesses damage from Cyclone Phailin (CNN) -- Morning light on Sunday revealed some of the damage from Tropical Cyclone Phailin, which made landfall on India's eastern coast as the strongest storm to hit India in 14 years. Power lines and trees were down and cars were overturned near the spot where the center of the storm struck the coast around 9 p.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) Saturday in eastern Odisha state, along the Bay of Bengal. Debris littered wet streets, roofs were torn off houses and windows on buildings were smashed in Brahmapur. Odisha's director-general of police, Prakash Mishra, told CNN that two men and a woman were killed by trees brought down by heavy winds in the state. Local police in Odisha told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees. Hurricanes are known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean, and the wind speed at landfall -- 140 mph -- made it equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. India evacuated more than a half-million people in advance of the storm, hoping to avoid a repetition of what happened 1999, when a cyclone claimed 10,000 lives. "We have taken a zero-casualty approach," said Odisha state disaster manager Kamal Lochan Mishra. "If people do not move, force will be used to evacuate them." Since Friday, Phailin has brought nearly 8 inches of rain to Odisha's capital of Bhubaneswar, about 30 miles from the coast. The city's average rainfall for October is 6.5 inches. The storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land, but tropical-storm-force winds are still possible through early Monday, said CNN Meteorologist Judson Jones. Rainfall will also be a problem as Phailin moves up toward the Himalayas in Nepal.	1
Even bundled up in a purple jacket and light blue turtleneck sweater, warming herself in a thick canvas emergency tent heated by a stove, the young Ukrainian woman feels the bitter chill. "It is very cold," she said. "The iced-over water freezes our blood. My skin burns off, and my hair falls off my head."From the other end of the line, an old man, who was bundled in a blue parka and cap, said, "I am freezing. I could not move my hands. I can barely hear you."They are huddled in a makeshift clinic inside a U.N. base camp on the edge of a frozen Ukraine village. They have no water, no food or medicine, not even a stove to warm them."They did not have a snow cone stand last night," a U.N. worker told me, "so they were really worried about their electricity and gas supplies." The base camp is the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has set up in this village of more than 4,000 people in eastern Ukraine as a shelter for about 130,000 people displaced by the conflict. The shelter is located 20 miles northeast of Slovyansk where Ukrainian forces on Sunday attacked pro-Russian separatists, driving them into the nearby town of Kramatorsk."We're very, very worried," said Elizabeth Baskerville, International Committee of the Red Cross staff member at the U.N. base camp. "We're worried about the winter, what is happening with electricity and gas. We've never had a disaster like this."Ukrainians displaced by the war shelter at the United Nations peacekeeping base in the village of Kramatorsk, UkraineIn February, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) opened a shelter in this village near Slavyansk. At that time, it set up a "hotel" for up to 50 people, but then it began evacuating the refugees more than a month earlier. At the time, people were not told why.A report on the ICRC website of a similar shelter at the Donetsk People's Republic said people were told that the main reason for the shelter was electricity.The Ukrainian peacekeeping forces and their Russian foes are fighting in Ukraine's east and south, an area controlled by both sides, in a conflict that began only in April, when	0
The DNA of a girl authorities think may have been abducted by a Roma couple in Greece doesn't match any profile in Interpol's database, the international law enforcement agency said Tuesday. In a case that has generated huge interest in Greece, authorities have charged the couple with abducting the child they call Maria. Interpol said Greek authorities have asked for its help in solving Maria's identity. "Until now, a comparison of the girl's profile against Interpol's global DNA database has not produced a match," Interpol said in a news release. Interpol said it would make the database available to authorities in countries where someone who claims to be a possible blood relative to the child has submitted a DNA profile. The agency has more than 600 missing people listed on its website, 32 of whom are 5 or 6 years old. A spokesman for a Greek children's charity said about 10 cases of missing children around the world are "being taken very seriously" in connection with Maria's case. "They include children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France," said Panagiotis Pardalis of the Smile of the Child charity. The couple who had Maria until last week appeared Monday in court and were remanded into custody pending trial. A lawyer for the couple says the pair adopted the child from her biological mother. The Smile of the Child said the girl, who was found Thursday in a Roma community near Larissa, central Greece, is being cared for in a group home. Medical tests indicate she is 5 to 6 years of age, slightly older than initially thought, said Pardalis. Police have said they suspect the records the couple provided for the child and for other children in their care may be false. In addition to the abduction charge, the couple is accused of falsifying official documents. Four officials, including the head of the registry office that issued Maria's birth certificate, have been suspended while a police investigation is under way, the media office of the Athens municipality said Tuesday. The girl received the document this year, it said. It is unusual for a birth certificate to be issued years later. 1,000 years of Roma discrimination Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blond hair, while her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, a race descended from Indian nomads, who face widespread discrimination in Europe.	1
According to comScore's new Mobile Metrix 2.0 report released Monday, Facebook's mobile usage is on the rise. In fact, the report revealed that Facebook users spent more time accessing the social network on smartphones than on computers in March. Facebook users spent an average of 441 minutes — or 7 hours, 21 minutes — accessing the social network via smartphones during the month. By comparison, users spent 391 minutes — or 6 hours, 31 minutes — checking out Facebook on PCs. The comScore report also revealed that smartphone users spent more time on Facebook than on any other social media network, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Foursquare. In fact, Facebook is the second largest mobile property behind Google. The social network garners more than 78 million unique monthly smartphone visitors, 81 percent of which access Facebook through its mobile app. Besides showing that people spend a good chunk of time on Facebook, the data underscores the importance of a mobile strategy for the social network's business success. Facebook currently makes little revenue from its mobile app — the app doesn't include ads, and only started to include "sponsored posts" in users' news feeds last March. Facebook admitted its mobile struggles in its recent IPO documents. "If users increasingly access mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users," the company writes in its filing documents, "our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected." In light of these stats, a Facebook smartphone makes all the more sense. The company could capitalize on its mobile leadership position. But because Facebook has not officially made any announcements about its hardware plans, it's unclear when a Facebook phone will actually enter the market. In the meantime, we can hope that the company continues to update its mobile apps. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here! Copyright 2011 Wired.com.	1
Over the past week, two popular Internet messaging companies, SnapChat and Skype, were hacked. SnapChat's 4.6 million users' user names and cell phone numbers were posted online. A hacker group posted messages to Skype's official blog and social media accounts. These are just the latest in a long list of tech companies that fail to provide adequate protection of their users' personal data. Do companies that offer free services have an obligation to protect our communications? Yes, absolutely. SnapChat is an app for phones that allows people to send photos and short videos to friends and promises to delete them once viewed, Ã  la Mission Impossible. In August 2013, a group of security researchers publicly reported weaknesses in SnapChat's programming interfaces that could allow data exfiltration and manipulation. They withheld the specific details that would enable someone to easily exploit the flaws. If you're mad at your critics, you might ignore them and quietly fix the flaws. If you're appreciative you might engage them in a dialogue, thank them and work out some time to fix things before telling the public about it. But it seems the founders of SnapChat chose instead to stick their heads in the sand. After four months without response, the security researchers grew impatient and decided to publicly disclose the details on Christmas Day, including code they had written that would allow almost anyone to abuse SnapChat's service. SnapChat then blogged that it knew about the flaws, but was satisfied with the changes it implemented and didn't expect the service to be exploited. The next day someone posted the user names and phone numbers of the 4.6 million SnapChat users that they had extracted using the security weaknesses. While some can make excuses for SnapChat by saying the company is young, hence inexperienced, a breach is still a breach. Skype, a division of Microsoft, can't even say that. Skype had the dubious distinction of being the first major Internet company to be compromised in 2014. It is the latest victim of a group called the Syrian Electronic Army, which has targeted numerous media companies over the years, including The Financial Times, BBC, NPR, Associated Press and Reuters. With more than 3 million followers on Twitter and 27 million "likes" on its Facebook page, you would expect the security of a company like Skype to be carefully managed. How did this so-called electronic army penetrate its defenses? It must have been an extremely sophisticated hack, right?	1
Kenya's national football team may not have made it to the World Cup Finals in Brazil -- but one man will be there for his African nation. Stepping into the role of representing Kenya is Aden Marwa, the country's first linesman to urn in the colours of his adopted country.A lot of people know Marwa from his time as the line judge on Kenya's main national TV station between 2003-2012. In his time he not only helped to deliver television rights for Nairobi's African Cup of Nations, but he also became Kenya's first linesman in the Football Association of Kenya's top flight of the Kenyan Super League and UEFA Champions League (the latter of which he was also the linesman in).Aden Marwa at the World Cup in Brazil in 2014His time in the Super League and UEFA Champions League was also marred by allegations of match-fixing and match-fixing allegations. That he still holds the job with the national team shows his belief in the importance of sports, both on the national and international stage.Marwa has been a linesman for over 20 years now, and is considered the second most famous linesman in Kenya after Yumelu Githu, with the most matches officiated and with the greatest number of goals scored. In his time he also became the first linesman to become the linesman for the African Cup and also the first linesman for Kenya to have received the FIFA Fair Play Award, awarded to the best linesman in football.In a recent interview with KickOff Africa, he spoke about being an ambassador for football in Kenya, the importance of sport in their lives and how it has changed them as people.KICKOFF: What have been the biggest changes that you have seen since you became the first linesman in Kenya?Aden Marwa: After I finished my national service I went to Europe where I played in the UEFA Competitions. There was a big change after I started playing for a local club there. It got to where in the clubs' first team, they really needed someone to referee.

A 14-year-old autistic Michigan girl whose mother allegedly tried to poison her with carbon monoxide in a murder-suicide attempt is recovering well, authorities said Tuesday. Isabelle Stapleton is "awake" and doing well, according to her attorney, Karen Lewis, who confirmed the teen was released from Children's Hospital and had since returned home. According to Lewis, Stapleton is now "talking, laughing, and learning.""She is still in the ICU having tubes in her throat and still having to be hooked to a breathing machine," Lewis said.Stapleton's mother, Amy Stapleton, 23, was charged Wednesday with attempted murder, but her case may not reach trial in the case."What is going on in the minds of the people who are deciding whether or not to allow my daughter back into the public has only my best interest at heart," the girl's father told MLive on Monday.The case has generated a host of social media outrage, with many people calling for an end to the girl's incarceration."My daughter is a human being who deserves the same dignity and respect that all humans deserve," Lewis said.Lewis noted that Stapleton's mother is facing child endangerment charges, but "if things turn out well" she may simply face neglect charges.Amy Stapleton — who has not yet entered a plea — reportedly said she was being held in her bedroom under house arrest while awaiting the results of an autopsy."It's a strange and sad situation for everyone involved," Lewis said. "My belief is that everyone involved is grieving. Everyone is having a difficult time coping — everyone is grieving."Lewis said Stapleton is doing fine and is "looking forward to returning to school in the spring." Stapleton has been home-schooled since her arrest on Monday, according to Lewis.Michigan State Police told MLive on Wednesday they have arrested Amy Stapleton, her husband Kyle Stapleton and their mother Isabelle Stapleton for alleged child endangerment and attempted murder."We are grateful for all our law enforcement partners who worked together to serve the Stapleton family and investigate this horrific and tragic situation," Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw said in a statement. "Our thoughts continue to be with the family and we thank them for their outpouring of support.	0
The number of confirmed swine flu cases across the globe kept rising Friday, but some signs of hope emerged in the battle against the worldwide outbreak. Tourists sunbathe wearing surgical masks in the popular Mexican resort ÃÂ£Playa del CarmenÃÂ£ , but despite several U.S. cities and provinces declaring swine flu pandemic and a nationwide drive to trace the origins of infections, the virus was spreading.Mexico recorded its highest number of new swine flu infections in a single week as of Friday, with the country reporting 588 confirmed cases. That makes Mexico the country with the most swine flu cases in the Western Hemisphere, where the virus has been sweeping the globe, infecting more than 40,000 people and killing nearly 500. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic.In addition to the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey are reporting swine flu infections, with Brazil reporting the most cases. But it's not just the cases that are on the increase. As cases spread, so do deaths. Mexico has recorded the highest number of deaths from swine flu in an entire year, while U.S. health officials have said the number of deaths is on pace to reach a record 3,000. Health officials have tried to slow the spread of swine flu by implementing school shut-downs, restricting restaurants from serving pork, and sending the military into the streets, but the virus continues to spread.The number of travelers coming into the country to tour the beaches of the Mexican Riviera has reportedly been on the rise as well, and experts say their numbers are on the rise as well. "The number is up to 50 people a day now coming to Mexico," says Mark McCarty, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. "The numbers we have heard that have come in the last three weeks are up, too." He says that he and U.S. State Department officials have recently received calls from passengers from many different countries.Mexico City has banned travelers from all but a few nationalities, including France, Japan, China, and Singapore. Mexico's National Institute of Public Health (INSP), however, said Friday that the number of patients it has found is still "moderately low." In a statement on the institute's website, it said that some of the cases "were classified as	0
Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners. "We have been able to talk with the miners. Their spirits are quite high," President Ollanta Humala told reporters outside the mine. But more work needs to be done before the rescue begins, Humala said. Engineers were working to make sure the mine was secure "so there are no victims," he said. "Those same engineers tell us that we have to wait a few hours. They haven't said how many," the president said. The miners have been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. Earlier Tuesday, one of the mining engineers in charge of the rescue declined to give a specific time frame for the operation. "We can't say how long it will take right now to get them out, but I can guarantee that they are alive, that they are in good health, and that ultimately they are going to be freed alive," engineer Carlos Bejarano said. A cave-in over the weekend complicated efforts. "It's very complicated work. We're taking into account all the necessary security measures to avoid risks among the rescuers themselves," said Cesar Chonate, a regional head of Peru's civil defense agency, the state-run Andina news agency reported. Video from state-run TV Peru showed workers, wearing hard hats and headlamps, loading rocks into a pushcart by hand. It was not clear what caused the initial collapse. The miners have been getting oxygen, food and water through a tube, which has also allowed them to stay in contact with people above ground, Andina reported. Peruvian Mining Minister Jorge Merino was also in the area and appealed to mining companies for their expertise, according to a statement from his office. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals. "The important thing is that the nine people are alive. We won't abandon them," Merino said. The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days. All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.	1
A fast-developing storm spawned at least one tornado Sunday in Billings, Montana, ripping the roof off a massive entertainment complex and causing extensive damage in the region. No injuries were reported. Amateur video shows the funnel cloud hovering over the MetraPark venue -- home to a sports arena, expo center and other facilities -- kicking up debris and peeling away the roof of one of the complex's buildings. Gov. Brian Schweitzer estimated that the roof damage could cost between $8 million and $15 million, but noted it was fortunate the arena was not hosting an event when the twister struck around 4:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). The damaged building held a football game at the same time just a night earlier, he said. Meteorologist Keith Meier of the National Weather Service in Billings estimated the tornado to be as strong as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated at more than 100 mph. Meier said the storm also produced quarter- to half-dollar-sized hail. Schweitzer plans to travel to the region Monday to survey the damage; he said the National Guard is ready to assist in cleanup efforts if needed. CNN's Jessica Jordan and Justin Lear contributed to this report.	1
If Diana Nyad never realizes her dream of swimming the Florida straits, it won't be for lack of trying. The 64-year-old began her fifth and last bid to swim from Cuba to the United States on Saturday morning. Previous ids, which had started in 2003 and had traveled north from Key West to Miami, had all ended in tragedy.In July 2004, after more than 50 days at sea, Nyad’s boat, the Yucatán Star, which she named the Amélie, broke apart during a collision with a cargo boat in Havana harbor. The two vessels separated, and while Nyad’s boat drifted away, the cargo ship disappeared into a maelstrom of debris, eventually washing up on the coast of Florida. She did not reach her destination.For the past two summers, Nyad had traveled almost 1,200 miles north to Key West, and then traveled another 100 miles south to Havana. She had hoped to swim the strait, and now she was on the far side of the United States, where she said she had dreamed of swimming since birth.“My heart is in this,” said Nyad, whose journey had been punctuated with moments of calm. She had felt the tug of a whale before, she said. More recently, when on the starboard hand of the Amélie Nyad spotted what she thought were two small, gray, beige dolphins floating far north. Then she was hit by an eerie, silent feeling, then an eerie, loud one. Nyad said she lost her bearings.“I tried to look at my watch for the last time, and all I could see in my brain was the sun. I was looking at a red light. And then it flipped. The light turned red. And it was red for hours — and hours. I thought everything was turning blue, and I was going to drown. I thought, ‘I need to swim to Cuba. I need to swim to the United States and live like this a long time.’ I had to get away at that moment or my life, my heart died,” she said.Nyad reached Key West, where she had spent the past four summers running an art exhibit. Afterward she returned to Havana. By August, she had moved from Havana to a hotel. She had been on the boat without food	0
A man carrying a Mexican flag interrupted Wednesday's Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, standing steps away from Malala Yousafzai as she received her award. Video of the event in Oslo, Norway, shows a young man with a camera around his neck holding a Mexican flag on the stage just a few feet from Yousafzai. He can be seen turning toward the 17-year-old Nobel Laureate and heard shouting "Please Malala" and mentioning Mexico. Oslo police said the Mexican citizen was not a guest at the ceremony and had managed to go through security checkpoints. He was not carrying a weapon, the police spokesman said. Mexico's Foreign Ministry confirmed in a statement that Norwegian police had detained a Mexican citizen after an interruption during the ceremony. He remains in custody, the foreign ministry said.	1
An unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I consider to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment." -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, New York Times Co. vs. Sullivan, 1964 It's downright icky that the Constitution does not protect free press in political debate. On the other hand, let's be honest here: It's not that the First Amendment guarantees full protection for free speech on political issues; it's that it guarantees the right to speak freely. As such, it's in the interests of both free press and free speech to promote an atmosphere conducive to a healthy political debate on these issues. And if you don't think that's the case, then you're the one who is violating the First Amendment by attacking and undermining my character in a political debate. (And you're the one who would be violating the First Amendment if you're attacking and undermining mine.) Or you just have a problem with the first amendment. I think we're done here.Now then, let's go through some of the specific criticisms you've made. Your first criticism -- or rather, your first major criticism -- is that I didn't provide you with enough evidence to support my claim that George Bush has lied about 9/11. In particular, the only thing you have cited from the 9/11 Commission Report that contradicts this charge is a quote from Commission member Philip Zelikow. In contrast, you made a similar criticism of me when I accused Bush of doing the same thing when he falsely claimed Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Of course, you can't point to Zelikow's quote, as he wasn't a member of the 9/11 commission, and you can't cite Zelikow as he was actually a witness to the 9/11 attack. But let's go through why you have chosen to accuse me of making these errors of fact: 1) Zelikow and I were not part of the 9/11 commission; 2) Zelikow's quote was not made during the commission's investigation, but instead during the aftermath of the attack when it became clear that Bush's claim was false; and 3) Zelikow was never a witness to the attack, so he couldn't have seen Bush lie about the attack. In this way, you've presented me with three separate errors of fact on just one single issue to justify your claim that I have made these five errors	0

Â A few days after it aired, NBC's Today Show featured a story about the story, but the piece was actually written and produced by Today's Â co-host, Matt Lauer.This is Lauer's second time at the helm of "Today," and he brings with him a history of Â flak from the late-night news anchor who helped make him a success.Lauer's first stint as host, from April 1992 to June 1995, was notable for his role in the network's Â most popular daily segment -- Â "A Day in the Life."In each installment, Lauer, a co-host since 1979, followed viewers around their lives as Lauer chronicled everything from the mundane to the momentous, all day long.As he explained in "A Day in the Life": "When you have a day like this, you get to the one thing that matters in life, and that is where there is a decision to be made."The segment's popularity forced its departure from the daily airwaves. But Lauer had no plans to retire. Not only did he have his own show, but he also was making commercials.Lauer was on his own in 1996.After taking a year off to focus on "Today," he came back with a new look on Jan. 12, 2000. Then, once again, he was forced to go off the air for six months.After he came back, Lauer quickly began to dominate the morning show.Lauer was so good, however, that his show was considered for the top spot by then-President Bill Clinton.This meant that producers needed to find someone to take over the spot when "Today" came back.After Lauer was tapped for it, the show's producers discovered he did not know his way around a studio.

Four Nigerian farmers and the environmental group Friends of the Earth took oil giant Shell to court Thursday in the Netherlands to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the Niger Delta. The farmers want the Anglo-Dutch multinational to Â give them a clean-up from which they can begin to grow food again and to make payments for the damage they suffered from Shell’s toxic oil spill in the Niger Delta in the 1970s and 1980s.ÂThe lawyers were acting on behalf of more than 20 Nigerian farmers, who are now suffering from the effects of Shell’s oil spill in the Niger Delta and the Dutch court’s decision will only serve to increase the suffering of Nigeria’s future generations. The farmers have already filed a civil complaint in the Netherlands with the court’s aim to have a remediation plan to help Nigeria begin producing food again.ÂLast month, the Niger Delta farmers filed a civil complaint with the Dutch court. Last week, they presented their detailed case, stating that the court is only ruling on Shell and not Nigerians. They also said that if the court decides to rule Shell should pay them in a year or two when the spill is over, it will be a slap in the face for them, and they would be paying for the oil spill a decade after the spill, and more.ÂIt’s true that the court is only ruling on Shell, but that’s not the point either. When the court takes the case of the Niger Delta farmers, it’ll be ruling on who they are and how they should be treated, and it will be the court’s duty to take them seriously, not just to put out any kind of propaganda.ÂThe Niger Delta farmers have suffered for many decades now, and it’s not just the government’s duty to take care of Nigerians, but to also take care of people who have suffered, and the court will be doing just that. It is this court’s duty to take the farmers seriously and, in the end, protect any kind of life that is at stake.ÂShell has now agreed to pay compensation, which will total to $9 billion, which is money that they owe to the people who are suffering for many decades. The cost of the clean-up operation is expected to be another $1 billion, and if the clean-up is successful,	0
A self-professed Apple fanatic, Jonathan Zufi was looking for a book of photography profiling the company's products through the years. When he didn't find one, the Atlanta software engineer decided to make one himself. "Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation" is the result. Released last month, the hardcover, coffee-table book contains 350 pages of photos documenting nearly every product the company has ever made. Apple has long been unapologetically focused on design and Zufi, a native of Melbourne, Australia, said he wanted to celebrate that with his images. "Other companies came up with the guts for a machine and then the engineers would find a way to stuff them into a box," said Zufi. "Steve Jobs started with the box and said, 'You need to find a way to get the guts in.' " The book, currently available only through its website, sells for $75, or $300 for a special edition which, along with other extras, comes with a custom-fit book case designed in a retro style inspired by Apple products of the 1970s and '80s. It's all an unlikely project for a software engineer with no formal photography training. Zufi bought new equipment and consulted with a professional as he began the project, which was four years in the making. All along, he focused on shooting artistic images that didn't resemble promotional product shots. "I didn't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material," he said. Instead, he said he approached each shot by looking for an image that would "create that same emotional connection to that product, but maybe doesn't look like something you've seen before." For example, when shooting the first version of the iPhone, released in 2007, he chose an image of the back of the phone. "I don't really remember seeing a lot of the photos of the back," he said. "It's little things like that." Zufi, who began sharing his images on the website Shrine of Apple, said he hasn't had any official communications with Apple about the book. "I didn't even try to reach out. I knew that it probably wouldn't get anywhere," he said.	1

The rapid thud-thud-thud of military choppers overhead on Wednesday was the first thing to catch the attention of the residents of Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico City known as a retreat for city-dwellers and urchins looking for their next hit of the nightlife. The noise pierced the silence of the early morning, and when the din died down, the first person to show up was a man who was quickly identified as the resident of the house next door, the one who owned the helicopter.The intruder was the new mayor of Cuernavaca, a city of more than two million people, and he was on a mission: to keep his neighborhood from becoming a haven for gangs and drug dealers, to fight corruption, and to make the city better for everyone. The man who greeted him outside Mayor Roberto Yunes’ house on a chilly morning was a member of the ruling party in the Mexican National Congress—a man who has been in politics for seven years and is now the leader of Mexico’s largest party.The newcomer is the latest young politician to take on the city’s top officials and become the city’s star. The new mayor’s rise—an all-too-familiar story in Mexico—has coincided with a more alarming trend in Mexico’s politics: the rise of the radical left.Mexico, where voters in the last presidential election had given President Enrique Peña Nieto a huge majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, hasn’t elected a new mayor in 19 years, and it’s not unusual for governments to be in power for a long time before the first new mayor or city council member ascends to power. But if this election is any indication, we’re likely to see many more young people in the country’s halls of power.Since 2007, when Yunes became Mexico’s youngest mayor at 28 years old, four of five young candidates have emerged from the municipal elections of the country’s largest cities: the four-term governor of the state of Baja California, Francisco Vallejo; Yunes; and two candidates from each of the country’s 11 states, who either ran for the same office in different cities or were the first people in their towns to achieve the status of mayor, such as José Luis Santiago, the mayor	0
Four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in "Skyrim," adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich, new worlds in a different vernacular. Assembling a new world and finding a new language to share it with others wasn't easy for a group of people who were all in their early 20s and were accustomed to the simple, straightforward way of thinking and problem-solving that helped fuel the first wave of scientific research.For the first few decades of the 20th century, science fiction writers and readers embraced the idea that science could solve life's problems and advance human evolution. New worlds were being built, societies were being born, and new civilizations were being forged.Many of these "scientific" stories didn't always end happily, but at least they gave readers hope and opened up the possibility of a better tomorrow.Here are some of the ideas behind the very first world building:1. The Myth of EvolutionThe fantasy world of "King Kong" is one where humans have been "driven" to conquer nature and become the dominant species. In the new world that "Kong" came from, the natural world was created to sustain man. The idea was that humans can and will evolve to be more like animals.As the "Kong" story goes, man is living in a time when all living things were nothing more than "stalkers of his own time." Humans have been artificially created from a primitive form of animal, just like the characters in a zoo or a circus. After being forced to survive by using their "natural intelligence" to explore, the humans of "Kong" were then introduced into forests and deserts in a desperate attempt to survive.In this world, there was only one problem: the "animal" inside the human body. As the human and the animal evolved, they became separate, and as a result, the human became a more intelligent and educated being.2. The New ScienceFor many years, science was considered to be the only way to solve humanity's problems. "The Time Machine" and "2001: A Space Odyssey" helped show the human mind's ability to explore the universe and learn how to live in an advanced civilization. It was believed that science has a way to solve all of the questions of life.People believed in progress in these early stories with one big	0
An American sailor fatally shot two female sailors before shooting himself Monday inside a U.S. military barracks in Bahrain, the Navy said. The alleged shooter, a male, survived the self-inflicted gunshot and was in critical condition at a military hospital in Bahrain, the Navy said. The man was under heavy security. The motive for the shootings is unclear, but the Navy said the incident was not terror-related and it involved only U.S. military personnel. The shootings occurred about 5 a.m., the Navy said in a news release. The base was closed for about an hour after the shootings. A Navy spokesman in Bahrain refused to provide any other details about the incident. Naval Support Activity Bahrain supports the U.S. Fifth Fleet, whose operations span about 7.5 million square miles across 27 countries. Included in the fleet's area of responsibility are the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman and parts of the Indian Ocean. The support base is located just outside Manama, the capital. Bahrain, a U.S. ally, is an island nation in the Persian Gulf, wedged between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  E-mail to a friend CNN's Barbara Starr and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.	1
As many as 86 Atlanta-based workers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have been unintentionally exposed to anthrax, the agency says. This includes people who have come forward since the announcement Thursday, saying they were in the area during the time of exposure. The workers are being monitored or provided antibiotics. "Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low," the agency said in a statement. "CDC believes that other CDC staff, family members, and the general public are not at risk of exposure and do not need to take any protective action." As of Thursday afternoon, the agency's Occupational Health Clinic had seen 54 employees identified to have been in the labs or hallways at the time of exposure, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. Of the 54 who have already been seen, Skinner said only two chose not to take oral antibiotic treatment. In addition to taking antibiotics to ward off any possible anthrax infection, the CDC says 27 staffers have received the anthrax vaccine. Skinner says remaining identified employees, who have not yet been evaluated at their clinic, are scheduled to be seen Friday. Early reports show that a lab did not adequately inactivate samples, which were then moved and used for experimentation in three laboratories not equipped to handle live Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax. Believing the samples were inactivated, workers in those labs did not don adequate protective equipment, the CDC said. The unintentional exposure was discovered on June 13. What to know about anthrax Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas were decontaminated. There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). Early symptoms can suggest the flu. "In the worst-case scenarios, literally, within a day or two of exposure, if you've inhaled spores and if they are very lethal, one begins to get -- as they say -- the standard flu symptoms -- high fever, malaise," said Leonard Cole, a bioterrorism expert. "You get lazy. You feel sick. You get headaches. You get bone aches. "And then after a day or two, in the worst case, if you don't get treatment, it could be lethal for you, and beyond treatment," he said.	1
In the last decade of the 20th century, the Turkish lira fell in value 1,000 times against the U.S. dollar, meaning that tourists returning to that country after several years found that any old money they still possessed since their last  paycheck was too small to allow them to return to the country.That led to the "Turkishization" of Turkish tourists. Some of those people traveled from Turkey by boat to the Greek islands, then to France, Spain, and Italy, and finally to Turkey. They then returned to Istanbul, where they spent their last moments in the world as the touristy, cash economy ended.That would be around 2008. That same year, Turkey was still a member of the Eurozone, and the lira was still the official currency of more than two-thirds of the population.So, how and when did Turkey’s currency lose its value? And what happened in those ten, nonstop years to make Turkish tourism, which had been running on borrowed money for decades, unviable?That’s what I set out to find out, and it ended up taking me on a roller-coaster adventure through the history of the Turkish economy.By the time I started, the Turkish lira had fallen out of dollar parity. Although, for a while, the lira did seem to be running ahead of the US dollar.When you were living in Turkish Istanbul, you didn’t have to go out to the supermarket or any stores at all – they all had their own cashier-less terminals — to shop with dollars. You didn’t have to worry about the government’s $12 billion bailout program (with the IMF and the European Central Bank) during the global 2008 financial crisis because that money came in the form of Turkish lira depreciation.But that isn’t true anymore. That money no longer exists. The Turkish government took the IMF bailout funds and made a big pile of money, so that instead of the IMF sitting back and collecting interest on the Turkish lira, the Turkish government collected nothing.So that’s the history of the Turkish lira’s devaluation against the US dollar.But why would the Turkish government have to devalue the currency if they were already making so much money off the Turkish lira?How did it happen in those 10	0
A magazine photo spread of Taliban fighters posing in the uniforms of 10 French soldiers killed last month has sparked an angry response. One of the pictures in the French  paper, Le Monde, shows a man wearing the red beret of a French soldier. He is lying on the ground, his hands raised above his head, while a group of fellow fighters stand around him. Another picture shows a man wearing a beret and gun belt of a soldier lying face down.The soldiers, according to the photo, died in "tactical operations" by the Afghan government's National Army in "Afghan territory controlled by the Taliban and al-Qaeda".The incident has sparked a wave of criticism from Afghan officials and the Taliban, and from the French media, which has used the incident to portray the French soldiers as "infiltrators" who "hijacked" the Afghan force.It was unclear exactly who was dressed in the soldier-beret pictured in the Le Monde publication. However, the man's appearance and the image of the Afghan flag hanging from a flagpole in the background of the picture indicate that the man is a member of the Afghan national army and that he is an Afghan.The man is believed to be Afghan. He has the uniform of a soldier, or officer. The military flag draped in front of him on the flagpole indicates he is an officer.Some Afghan officials said they suspected a US officer was in the picture, and asked the French media for proof. They said they were told the picture had been altered and they were shown pictures of two French soldiers wearing Afghan uniforms to prove the picture in question was of an Afghan soldier. These two soldiers are wearing berets, or red berets, that are commonly worn by Afghan officers.The two men seen in the picture that were shown to Afghan officials are, according to the Afghan government, two Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers. The difference in their uniformed uniforms and the image of the Afghan flag indicates that the photograph was not doctored. The two Afghan soldiers wear different rank than the soldier-like-figure on the grass, and the ANA soldiers are armed. The image of the Afghan flag in the background suggests they are on their own, in Afghan territory.In a statement, the French army said their soldiers in Afghanistan "have always held the utmost regard for the service of our Afghan and international partners".

With the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan winding down, the United States and its allies have made a remarkable decision in December 2006 to withdraw most of their troops and turn over security to U.N. troops.The Taliban has been driven out from the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, but the anti-Taliban forces are still in control of key areas in the	0

Ken Henggeler poured his grief into the thing he loved most: carpentry. Shaken by the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the retired teacher and longtime resident of Newtown went to his barn, picked up an oak children's bench and went to work. He sawed away, cutting it into two shelves. On one, he made 20 individual slots for candles, one for each slain child. On the other, he placed six candles for the heroic educators. He drove into town, unsure of his destination. At the intersection of Main Street and Sugar Street, he felt a tug. After all, the park there is called The Pleasance. On a tree and nearby street pole, there were two signs. Both read: Pray for Newtown. It was the perfect spot. Just enough room to fit the shelves, and just enough space to let people hug, pray and cry. He and his wife, Darla, placed the shelf for the children in front and the one for the educators in the back, as if still watching over their young students. Henggeler struggled to light each candle. First one. Then two. Then three. "It was really hitting me," he said, "with how many were involved." Glimpses of normalcy amid reminders of horror A car pulled up and a man placed a giant brown teddy bear next to the makeshift shrine. More people came. All wept. The memorial grew and grew. "We did it to help ourselves, and maybe the town," said Henggeler, a resident of 15 years. "I just wanted to do something. Now, I'm in awe." The pain in Newtown is suffocating. It's felt on every corner, in every store, in every church. Each fresh news report -- each photo of those precious children, those tiny victims with so much youthful exuberance -- brings another wave of emotions, of sorrow, horror and disbelief. Did you hear a child was shot 11 times? Can you believe the strength of Robbie Parker -- whose daughter Emilie was killed -- to forgive the shooter's family? Why did the shooter take out his rage on such pure innocence? The shooter's name isn't mentioned in conversations. It's just too damn painful. Newtown is grappling with other pressing questions: How does the town handle 26 funerals with only one funeral home? What becomes of the school building, and when do Sandy Hook students begin school again?	1
Rwanda held solemn commemorations Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, with many survivors overcome with emotion as they relived the trauma of the killings that left 800,000 people dead. Official mourning, which began three months ago with a flame of remembrance touring towns and villages across the small central African nation, culminated Monday with the arrival of the torch at the national genocide memorial. Wreaths were also laid in Kigali's soccer stadium, where U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, heads of state and European and U.S. diplomats gathered. President Paul Kagame lit a flame that will burn for 100 days, the length of time the killings lasted. At a ceremony at the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of their survival. Some, sobbing and overcome with emotion, were carried outside. "This should never happen in human history," Ban said of the massacre. Diplomatic dispute The events also bore reminders of festering anger as a diplomatic dispute broke out over renewed allegations from Kigali of French complicity in the genocide. France said Monday that its ambassador to Rwanda had been barred from attending the events marking the anniversary. In a written statement, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said Ambassador Michel Flesch, who was to represent France during the commemorative events in the Rwandan capital, had been informed Sunday night "of the decision of the Rwandan authorities not to authorize him to take part in the ceremonies." "We regret this decision. However our embassies will take part today in the several ceremonies held across the world to pay tribute to the memory of the victims of the genocide," the spokesman added. France said over the weekend that it had canceled plans to attend the ceremony after Kagame's accusations of French involvement in the massacre. The weekly Jeune Afrique quoted Kagame as saying in an interview that both France and Belgium had played a "direct role ... in the political preparation of genocide and participation in its execution." The French Foreign Ministry said that France was "surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration. "These accusations are in contradiction with the process of dialogue and reconciliation that has gone on for several years between our two countries," the ministry's statement said.

Our country has changed," wrote Chief Justice John Roberts on June 25, 2013, when five of the nine Supreme Court Justices dismantled the historic Voting Rights Act. Roberts is correct in at least one respect: Today's vernacular, political discourse and public behavior is more polarized than any time in our nation's history. One result is the decline of civility and respect for the law.For the past two and a half years, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Roberts has taken the nation's Constitutionally mandated role in our democracy, along with its role in governing a strong economy, and shredded it. Instead of upholding our laws and our Constitution, Roberts and his fellow Justices have taken them apart. They have done nothing to protect our freedom, the freedom to choose our own leaders and their political parties, the freedom to form and participate in our own communities. Instead, they have dismantled the foundations of our republic.This is a profoundly undemocratic way to operate a government; it is not just an act of pure power politics. As a practical matter, the only hope to restore the rule of law and a respect for our Constitution is to replace Roberts with a leader who will restore our constitutional protections as our country's governing institution.But to replace Roberts, to find a leader who will restore government to its constitutional role in our democracy and the Constitution of the United States, we do not need to wait. We must elect a new president in 2016. If we cannot elect a candidate who will restore the rule of law, then we will need to at least elect a candidate who will protect the Constitution.The Supreme Court's destructive actions are in no way an aberration. The Court's actions over the past two and a half years have been an alarming indictment of the United States as the indispensable nation we are. The time must now come to replace the Supreme Court's destructive actions that have undermined our constitutional fabric.Our Constitution is the foundation of our free society. It is the only way we can govern ourselves.It is time to replace Roberts with a leader who will restore the rule of law and a respect for our Constitution.Lloyd E. Bentsen is a Republican member of the United States Senate and a former United States Secretary of Transportation. His latest book is "To Serve and Protect: The Men who Won the Civil War."	0
Less than three months ago, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down eagerly awaited rulings on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action. Next month, the court will begin its new term and likely deal with controversial issues such as abortion, campaign finance reform and the separation of church and state. When the court is in the middle of a term, it is easy to focus on hard legal questions, the legal views of individual justices and the consequences of landmark decisions. Now is a good time, when the court is in recess, to take a step back and look at the institution itself. A lifetime is too long First, our Supreme Court justices are the only judges in the world who sit on a country's highest court and have life tenure. Because the president nominates the justices and the Senate confirms them, the American people do not elect the justices and cannot vote them out of office. In light of the crucial role the court plays across the spectrum of social, legal and political issues, the question of how long our justices serve should be re-examined. Supreme Court justices often serve more than 25 years and beyond the time they are still fit to perform their duties. For example, according to renown author David Garrow, both Justices William O. Douglas and Thurgood Marshall remained on the bench well after their skills had significantly diminished beyond the point of competence. The usual justification for life tenure is that the justices need to be independent of the other branches of the government to adequately perform their duties. This need for independence is real and compelling, but there are other ways to achieve that goal. Other countries use fixed terms, retirement ages or a combination of the two to achieve the necessary independence. There simply is no persuasive reason to allow governmental officials who have virtually unreviewable power to hold their offices for life. Few witnesses to history The second aspect of our Supreme Court that needs to be changed is the lack of television coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements. What a shame that during the last week of June when the court handed down and read from the bench numerous important decisions -- including the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act and the formula in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- the American people had to hear the news indirectly from media personalities instead of the justices.	1
What is the value and impact of international aid? In an era of global austerity, this is a question that is frequently posed by policymakers and the citizens they represent. The truth is, it is actually quite hard to  quantify the value and impact of international aid. In some areas, we know that large amounts of aid may help countries reduce poverty. We know that in other areas, aid can often make the world a better place.At the same time, however, most aid recipients appear to have little or no impact on the poverty and deprivation they receive assistance for. This article sets out an alternative way of looking at aid and its impact, one that focuses on what aid does not do. This chapter looks beyond the obvious to explore how the impact of aid could be better understood. Although much remains unknown, we find that a much more nuanced view of the value and impact of international aid can create a more productive dialogue between aid and recipient nations.There has been a recent resurgence in international aid, with the number of organizations receiving the UN's most recent funding round set to increase from $17.1 billion in 2014 to $20.7 billion in 2018.[1] As is often the case, though, not all organizations that receive aid are effective. Some work poorly in their assigned areas, others do not, and some organizations receive more than their fair share of the world's aid money.To provide an unbiased view, I began by analyzing the impact of aid on the poorest five percent of the world’s population. My findings show that aid has been successful on the whole, but that it is important to go beyond just examining the impact of aid on the poorest five percent. Examining the poorest five percent provides an incomplete picture of who the recipients of aid are and the extent to which they benefit from the aid. Looking beyond the poor reveals the value of aid, but can also highlight the fact that aid alone is unlikely to help everyone affected by global poverty. Finally, by combining the best of both approaches – examining both the value and impact of aid – we can find better ways to address global poverty.Table 1 shows the poverty rate (PR) for each country in 2015 (the year that I examined the data). The PR is the sum of the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) (purchasing power parity is a system used to convert income into PPP; a lower P	0
The startling thing, in the long run, is not that the power went out and stayed out in so many parts of the United States during the week just ended. The startling thing is what we so casually take for granted: Flip a switch, and the lights in your home instantly blaze to life. Turn a knob, and clean water comes rushing into your sink or bathtub. Pick up a telephone, and you're talking with someone halfway across the country or halfway around the world. News: Cold front expected to bring relief from heat, but also storms Right now, the most pressing matter is to get the electricity back on in the places that are still without it. People are in despair; people have died. Fierce storms, along with near-record-high temperatures, combined during the final days of June and the first week of July to bring down multiple power systems and leave millions of people sweltering in the dark. But once all is up and running again, it might be good to pause and think about how fragile all of our assumptions are. For much of the time that the continental United States has been a part of the planet, few of the life-easing developments we nonchalantly take on faith seemed remotely possible. Electricity? Running water? Air conditioning? They were the stuff of science-fiction novels. Ours was a land mass of forests and rivers and deserts and plains, a tangled and disconnected tableau that disappeared from view with the blackness of night. We -- not you and I, but our ancestors -- figured out how to change all that. By the time recent generations came along, everything seemed so endlessly convenient. The battle for civilization had been won. Which is why a week like the one just past is such a sobering reminder that we are always just an unanticipated disaster away from a trip into the primitive America that existed before. Doubt it? Ask your fellow citizens who waited and waited for someone to turn their lights back on last week. News: Resilient West Virginians brave storms and their aftermath	1
With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an "always-on" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar. The details Â are, in a nutshell, that the Xbox One will be able to play just about a thousand games simultaneously, but at a lower quality than the 360. It will have a Blu-Ray player in the box, as well as a 500 GB hard-drive. As with any new technology, there are a number of myths floating around: the hard drive is for storing all the game data, not pictures of objects (it actually stores video data), it's a mere storage device, it can't be hacked, blah blah blah.The thing is, that the Xbox One is a great piece of equipment. It is the best home-video-game machine on the planet right now. But as with anything, there are problems with it. I have owned and played dozens of consoles and I have never ever, ever had a system that could play all those games at the same time. I have never owned one that could play all the movies at the same time. And I have never owned one that could play all the music at the same time. I have one that can only play one copy of each game at a time. So there are a lot of issues with the product, but the fact is, the new Xbox One has to not only be better than the PS3 (and the 360) but it has to be better than all the other boxes out there. And Microsoft has given us a pretty good game preview, which looks to be the perfect setup on those points (and hopefully, the hardware is good enough to back up what the software promises).That being said, there are a few things that bother me about the system and I will lay them out below. One - the hard drive. It's too low-quality. It doesn't have the capacity of a hard drive, and all the games I've tried for the system only install on to the hard drive. I am pretty sure this is a flaw in the design and I don't think anyone is ever going to have a system with a hard drive that can hold a thousand games at once. The other major issue I have is with the Kinect. I know the thing is cool, and it works fine when your friend plays a Kinect game with	0
A small passenger plane crashed in the mountains of western Nepal, killing all 18 people on board, authorities said Monday. The Twin Otter aircraft left Sunday afternoon from the tourist town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. It was on its way to Jumla, a remote town about 600 kilometers (373 miles) northeast of Kathmandu, when it went missing. The flight usually takes an hour. "Police have reached the crash site and no survivors have been found," said Bam Bahadur Bhandari, regional police chief of Pokhara. "The bodies are being collected." The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. The plane was flying in poor weather conditions as it had been raining and snowing across the country for the past few days. "The aircraft seems to have hit a mountain" said Bimlesh Karna, deputy director of Nepal's civil aviation authority. Among the 18 on board were three crew members and a Danish national. Of the 17 Nepalese, one was a child, Karna said. The 40-year-old Canadian-made Twin Otter aircraft belonged to state-owned Nepal Airlines. The crash has once again raised concern over Nepal's air safety record. There were two fatal air crashes each year from 2010 to 2012 in this Himalayan country.	1
It's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance. We've traveled for more than three hours up a windy, icy road in western China. Our hope is to get to the Tibetan autonomous zone, in the mountainous region of Sichuan province, an ersatz Tibet that's more accurately translated as "China."The government in Beijing says the Dalai Lama, who has resided in northern India for most of the past 45 years, is a "non-person" and is not on the official government list of recognized Dalai Lamas.However, some of the country's most prominent Buddhist monks and nuns, including those at the main Tibetan monastery in the city of Dharamsala, live the life of nomad Tibetans in exile in India.The road to Dharamsala is one of the most perilous in Tibetan history. It takes four trucks to make the 1,700-kilometre journey from Lhasa to the border.The driver climbs out onto the back of his truck and begins to pull to the side of the road. He talks to the other drivers as they pass by.Eventually, his truck turns back and moves along to park next to the front end of a jeep. A man climbs out and asks for directions."I've been here before," he says, holding out his hands and leaning on the jeep's roof. As he walks toward the front of the jeep, the driver points him out to the man and his two companions on the back of the truck. They get in and head off into prayerful silence.As we pass a local village a woman in a red woolen robe and a red flower-patterned scarf offers us tea and a bowl of steamed rice."They are my family. The police came and arrested them when they were on the way here from here."Our jeep reaches the outskirts of the village. There, in the middle of the road, are two cars and three trucks."Where are we?" I ask the driver.A young man with an open, friendly face climbs out. He is the manager of a local restaurant. He says my Chinese is perfect, and he can answer any questions we have.He says everyone in the village knows about the two trucks that have just left, and those who were with them know this	0
Ever since "Bridge-gate" threatened to derail the once "inevitable" nomination of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as the Republican presidential candidate for 2016, Jeb Bush has been hinting that he might jump into the fray. And with last week's Facebook announcement, the former Florida governor has emerged as a serious contender -- if he chooses to run. The announcement of an exploratory committee has generated instant excitement because many Republicans feel that the former governor stands a very real chance of winning both the Republican nomination and the general election. Though the pundits have pored over all of his liabilities, most importantly the damage that his older brother inflicted on the family name, Jeb Bush brings a lot to the table for 2016. If he handles this process the right way, Bush has the opportunity to put together a strong campaign. Democrats and his Republican opponents should be worried. The most important asset Jeb Bush offers is that he is a known commodity, someone who is greatly respected in Republican circles. In this day and age of freewheeling primaries, the comfort level that experience and familiarity provides to potential donors and voters means a lot. Republicans are desperate to win back the White House after eight years of Democratic rule. Their recent success in the midterms whet their appetite for gaining control over the government. Republicans know that the electoral math will be extremely difficult for them in 2016 as more voters, particularly among Democrats, are likely to come to the polls and the electoral college map favors blue. Republicans have watched many of their candidates crash and burn in recent primaries, so they are eager to find someone who make it through to the finish line for the nomination and present a strong case in the general election. Bush can survive the pressure from the right in the primaries. All the speculation as to whether someone like him will be done in by the Tea Party in primaries is vastly overblown. Most importantly, other than on immigration reform and education policy, Bush is a conservative and has a record to prove it. As Frank Bruni of The New York Times recounted, moderate is not really a label that fits his record. He has a rather conservative record on tax cuts and gun rights, one that would be quite appealing to the right. He is a staunch opponent of abortion rights and same-sex marriage.	1
Former Argentina coach Diego Maradona has agreed a two-year deal to manage Dubai-based Al Wasl, according to the club. Maradona, who is widely acknowledged to be one of  world's top coaches having won the FIFA World Cup with Diego Maradona in Italy in 1986, has signed a contract that will see the 45-year-old take over from previous boss Richard Money. Maradona will begin his new role with Al Wasl in the UAE League One on May 3. The club will announce his first game in charge at the club's home matches against Real Raja Casablanca on May 17. Maradona has led Al Wasl to the AFC Cup final since his appointment in 2008.Maradona, who left his coaching job at Club Atlético Independiente (AC) after winning the Club World Cup in Japan in 2002, joins Al Wasl in the UAE having agreed to a two-year deal.

Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday. The plane, an Airbus A330-200, originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed Wednesday. All but one of the 104 passengers on board were killed. The sources said that as the pilot approached Tripoli International Airport, he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft. He realized he was in trouble and tried to pull the plane up and turn the auto-pilot back on to give it another try, the sources said. But the effort was too late and the plane slammed violently into the ground, explaining the condition of the wreckage and damage to the plane's tail at the crash site, the sources said. An investigation into the crash is under way, and authorities are reviewing the aircraft's flight data recorder. Meanwhile Ruben van Assouw, the 9-year-old sole survivor of the plane crash, has returned home to the Netherlands. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at Al Khadra Hospital, said a doctor at the hospital who declined to give her name. Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Dutch foreign ministry representative said. Ruben's family issued a statement Friday expressing gratitude to people who have helped them, such as Libyan hospital professionals and Dutch envoys, as well as the outpourings of sympathy from citizens in both countries. The family also thanked "the vast majority of the Dutch media for respecting our privacy." The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed. "Considering the circumstances, Ruben is doing fine. He is sleeping a lot; now and then he wakes up and is then lucid," the family said in the statement. "He has drunk a little, and has seen the flowers and cuddly toys." Ruben's family said it has to deal with "two kinds of grief" -- the sorrow the boy is enduring and the sadness over the loss of the other family members. "The coming period will be very difficult for us," the family said. "We hope that all the media will respect our privacy." More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said.	1
The silly season is upon us: the time during an election year when those trying to muck up the other side throw all sorts of nonsense about a candidate onto the public wall. Hillary Clinton, because she's the Democrat's presumptive 2016 front-runner, has become the target du jour. Frankly, I don't know how public figures get through it. I'm reminded of Henry Kissinger's remark, which I'm paraphrasing: "It's impossible to be paranoid in Washington because the definition of paranoia is the 'false belief that someone is out to get you.' In Washington, someone is always out to get you." The latest craziness comes from Matt Drudge, who publishes the Drudge Report, the political equivalent of an online supermarket tabloid. Drudge funnels anonymous propaganda into the mainstream media, propaganda it might not buy otherwise. That's the secret to his success. Of course, some of what he reports is solid stuff. But there is space to fill daily. So, somewhat like a National Enquirer reporter who dreams up his day's "scoop" while showering, Drudge teases his readers with innuendo and fluff. So often, it's hard to tell the difference between fluff and fact. Maybe Drudge is more entertainer than reporter. I imagine he enjoys baiting the mainstream media, then watching it look foolish when his story is debunked. Take, for example, his tweet about Hillary Clinton, which caused something of a media firestorm. People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera. Only the top part of the chair showed after the picture was cropped for publication. So Drudge tweeted the picture, asking, "Is Clinton Holding a Walker?" That was at 12:16 p.m. on June 4. By "coincidence," 74 minutes later, at 1:30 p.m., The Wall Street Journal's political division tweeted: "Is that a walker? Hillary Clinton's latest magazine cover is raising eyebrows." That may be a record time from right-wing hype-and-blarney to validation from a major publication.	1
The New England Patriots rallied to down the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday and win Super Bowl XLIX at Glendale, Arizona. Quarterback Tom Brady completed a Super Bowl record 37 passes and threw for four touchdowns. The Patriots are the sixth team to win at least four Super Bowl trophies. Brady overcame two interceptions and threw for 328 yards. Julian Edelman caught nine passes and had the game-winning touchdown with 2:02 remaining in the contest. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson shrugged off a slow start to complete 12 of 21 passes for 247 yards, but he threw an interception at the Patriots goal line with 20 seconds to go. Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch had 102 yards rushing and one score. The Patriots trailed 24-14 before Brady threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter.	1
Hong Kong, with its glittering skyscrapers and luxury malls, is home to some of the world's richest people but new government figures show that a fifth of its population lives in poverty. About 1.3 million people, or 19.6%, of the ersatz wealth of the city's elite make do with $1,100 a year or less. More than 12 million people live on a £1.23 ($1.64) a day.In a recent book, City of Mirrors, the British journalist Anthony Scaduto traces the roots of this poverty to a single cause : land. Many Hong Kongers, he writes, are being priced out of the cities that their parents and grandparents were born in because land has become so expensive.Today the most expensive places to live in Hong Kong are in the suburbs, not the central city. The most expensive flat in the world in this part of London is worth nearly £4,000 ($6,300), or $6,300 per sq metres. A flat in Soho, one of the wealthiest parts of London, sells for just a few hundred dollars.Hong Kong's land price boom started about 10 years ago, as the city boomed in the global economy. Land prices jumped from $10,000 ($14,500) per sq foot in 2005 to $24,500 per sq foot today, a 50% rise.The price rises were particularly sharp in the central city. The median prices for new condo flats in central Hong Kong have more than doubled in the past five years, according to a survey by Propertymark.The land price surge is part of a larger transition of Hong Kong's economy from an export-led manufacturing base to one which is dominated by financial services and tourism. Land prices are rising because the government has cut subsidies and taxes on land to make up for the reduction in the value of its own land.That may be good news for a growing number of Hong Kong's elite. But it has left a whole generation to struggle to cover the basics of life. On a good day, people in Hong Kong are lucky if they get just $20 a day from the government or get about $2,700 ($4,600) for their house."Some people have been coming back to Hong Kong for a year now to find they can't afford a house," says the founder of Home for Christmas, a	0
Los Angeles police have launched an internal investigation to determine who leaked a picture that appears to show a bruised and battered Rihanna. Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her Â boyfriend Chris Brown during a shopping trip at Paris Fashion Week in January.She and Brown were in a photo session with photographers when a photographer asked the singer if she was okay. But Rihanna said, "No, I'm not. I'm not. (He) punched me twice."Then another photog asked for the pair to repeat their answer."No, I'm not," Brown responded before punching Rihanna, who fell to the ground in her hospital room.Brown's lawyer called Rihanna's photo-taking process "an invasion of privacy."A few weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder dismissed a lawsuit that Brown had filed. She ruled that the singer's allegations constituted defamation and were therefore an official government record that had the right to be protected.In response to the lawsuit, Brown and his manager said the singer was attacked and that she took a photo of him for a personal album. They said she should not have given her consent to take a picture without his permission. They also filed a counter-claim to win damages and compensation for her injuries.But the judge said the public needed to know that the case was dismissed "because of the public's interest in the fair and truthful presentation of a dispute and the public's interest in free speech."The picture of the singer with her bruised face was published by paparazzi in France two weeks ago. French courts ordered a publication ban on it.Brown pleaded no contest to assaulting the singer and was sentenced to six months in jail. It was overturned, and Brown appealed. He is due to be released in less than two weeks.According to reports from the singer's representative, Brown's lawyer has offered a $30,000 settlement to Rihanna should her lawsuit against his client fail.According to reports on the website, the settlement offer was accepted by Rihanna's lawyer.Rihanna's father, Diddy, is in a legal dispute with the rapper. He is demanding that Brown pay child support for his daughter. Brown's lawyer said he would "fight" to pay any legal fees.Rihanna was in Paris with her management team and Paris Fashion Week designer André Leon Talley to	0
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has proposed the dissolution of Argentina's domestic intelligence service, as the country deals with the fallout from the mysterious death of a federal prosecutor who accused its leaders of a criminal  cover-up and corruption.In a letter read out on national television, the president asked the Supreme Court to annul the service's director, Carlos Pagni. Earlier this month, the court ordered the former Argentine intelligence chief to appear in person to explain his decision to resign over an alleged plot to kill a former judge whom he had accused of being corrupt and in league with drug traffickers.Kirchner's decision was taken amid a series of high-profile judicial moves. The former governor of the western province of Santa Cruz, a key player in a case related to the prosecutor's death, was convicted on 10 counts of being part of a network of organised crime and was sentenced to nine years in prison. She also ordered four former high-ranking agents to stand trial and fined them 1 million pesos each for corruption.But Kirchner's latest move on intelligence issues is widely seen as a test of her ability to confront powerful politicians and groups that have long sought to influence politics, judicial and security affairs.She described her move as a "political measure" but did not rule out the possibility that it could have repercussions for the service."This is not a legal action against the intelligence agency; it is a measure of democracy where, as a citizen, you can ask for justice to prevail," she said in an interview with Argentine media broadcast earlier this month.Argentina's government has maintained that Pagni was forced to resign following a "political intervention" from the interior ministry, which ordered the firing of the former head.Kirchner said the former intelligence chief was in communication with the ministry despite his resignation."It seems like a witch hunt," she said.The service, whose job is to gather information about political, economic, international and defence issues, was created in the late 1970s from the merger of three previous agencies dealing with security – the national police, the National Intelligence Directorate and the Military Intelligence Service – and one which oversaw the defence ministry.It is one of the country's most powerful agencies, having a $10bn annual budget, including $700m allocated to the intelligence budget. It has no political or military oversight.	0
Canada reserved the best to last as its ice hockey heroes beat arch-rivals the United States 3-2 with an overtime goal from Sidney Crosby to claim the final gold of the Winter Olympics. Crosby, Canada's star iced-goaltender, was named most valuable player during the ceremony on Wednesday in Sochi, Russia, after he stopped all 33 shots he faced to beat the U.S. in the shootout.U.S. goalie Rick Wamsley was named the most valuable player of the tournament because he stopped all five shots he saw in the shootout.The U.S. scored twice on Saturday and two more on Sunday night to top the Canadians. Crosby scored in the first period of the final contest and added an assist on John Scott's goal in the third period.In the shootout, Crosby became the first player to score a shootout goal in three straight world championships, and the first player ever to do it in three straight Olympic games.And Crosby became the first North American player to win a shootout title, joining his brother, Paul, who won back-to-back world titles in 2004 and 2005 and helped the United States to the gold in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver."It is amazing to be able to compete at this level with guys like Sidney and [Ryan] Getzlaf and Z that are playing in the same level," Scott said after the game. "To have a chance to get to the final game of the tournament was a huge honour."Everybody that has played in these four Olympics is special, but it is the guys that have come before us and have had the opportunity to do it and I am just happy to be a part of it and I am trying to live up to a lot of people that have come before me."The five-time Hart Trophy winner, Wamsley was named the tournament's most valuable player after stopping 39 shots in the shootout.The U.S. squad was also outstanding, including two Olympians — Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane — and three rookies, including Brandon Saad, who went from the NHL to the WHL to the NCAA before putting his skills to use at the Olympics on the power play."I just have to look at the positives of it," Kane said. "I thought we had good offensive zone faceoffs, we had a lot of offensive chances off the penalty kill and we	0
Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum resigned Thursday as head of the Interior Department's scandal-plagued Minerals Management Service, the department's chief said. Two sources told CNN that Birnbaum had been ÃÂvery vocalÃ¢Â about wanting to reduce the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs budget. She had been a "distinguished member of the Mineral Management ServiceÃ¢ÂÂs senior staff," said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Zinke said that BirnbaumÃ¢ÂÂs resignation was unrelated to the agencyÃ¢ÂÂs budget Ã¢ÂÂ she was a longtime employee. Ã¢ÂÂShe has served in this position for nearly 18 years. Ã¢ÂÂI do know her and have the utmost respect for her,Ã¢ÂÂ Zinke said. âShe was very vocal about wanting to reduce the Mineral Management ServiceÃ¢ÂÂs budget. She was not a member of this administration,ÃÂ he said. Ã¢ÂÂShe resigned because of the work she was doing and leaving because of the work of the MMS.ÃÂ Zinke said he does not know if BirnbaumÃ¢ÂÂs resignation was motivated by the budget cut. The agency has been plagued by controversy, including allegations of improper behavior by contractor employees responsible for the handling of public lands on which Zinke once spent months as president of a Montana mining camp. Zinke said he expects his agency to "solve the problem and move forward as the Interior Department has." Ã¢ÂÂI know that the MMS is not going to continue to have problems, and we plan to have an MMS that is going to be very successfulÃ¢ÂÂ said Zinke. Ã¢ÂÂWe're going to be able to manage our resources and to provide the very best value for the American taxpayerÃ¢ÂÂ said Zinke.

The Netherlands plans to ban foreigners from the country's famed pot shops, a decision Amsterdam's tourism industry hopes goes up in smoke. The Dutch Cabinet late last month said the measure was needed to "reduce nuisance and drugs ilegal trade." Some Dutch businesses say the ban hurts their business.The Netherlands plans to ban foreigners from the country’s famed pot shops, a decision Amsterdam’s tourism industry hopes goes up in smoke.The Dutch Cabinet late last month said the measure was needed to “reduce nuisance and drugs ilegal trade.”Some Dutch businesses say the ban hurts their business.About 80 people have been arrested over the past year on suspicion of trafficking drugs in the Dutch city of Amsterdam.Dutch authorities say the sale of cannabis was down 15 percent last year, down to 1,077 kilograms compared to 2,069 kilograms in 2013. The police say about 60 percent of the drugs seized were hashish.Cannabis is only legal for medicinal purposes in the Netherlands.Although cannabis is legal for medical use in the Netherlands, it is seen as a gateway drug by many young people looking to get away from their parents.“The Netherlands is such a nice place for a vacation,” said Harsha Rana, 31, a student from India who visited the Netherlands in January for a three-month holiday. “I have a family, but I like to be independent.”The government of the Netherlands has, however, put a ban in place on visitors from any country with less than 35 million people. More than 80 percent of people from India reside in this country.“For a holidaymaker from India you cannot travel to the Netherlands or the other countries without a visa,” said Jeroen van der Spek, head of the Netherlands’ tourist board and a former diplomat.The government has said it wants to protect the country’s tourism industry, which has already suffered due to the country’s economic crisis.“This is clearly ridiculous,” said Hervé Pannen, the chief executive of Amsterdam’s biggest tourist office, which manages 70,000 tourists a year. “But now it’s happening and it’s hard to stop.”The Netherlands has long banned foreigners from entering the	0
Archaeologists have found more than 600 relics from a huge battle between a Roman army and Barbarians in the third century, long after historians believed Rome had given up control of northern Germany. Some of the urns, vases and statuettes were likely used in the fighting and have been found at three locations in the region as well as in a number of other sites.One of the discoveries was made in a grave dated to AD 253, when the town of Augsburg was destroyed by the barbarians.  During the battle, Roman soldiers were wounded with stones, swords, and arrows. The vase found with the bones is decorated with a helmet with a crest, symbolizing victory.Other items found were a number of spears and swords, including those made from mammoth ivory. A number of swords also found at this site have inscriptions in Germanic and Latin, which indicate they belonged to Roman soldiers.The finds were made using two different techniques, using an excavator and a metal detector. The metal detector is a "metal sieve" that picks up metal particles, which are then separated by a special screening process. The excavator collects the bones of the soldiers and assembles them into large molds.See alsoRoman history timelineReferencesCategory:Roman conquest of northern EuropeCategory:Archaeological sites in GermanyCategory:Archaeological discoveries in GermanyCategory:Archaeological sites in HesseCategory:Archaeological sites in BavariaCategory:3rd-century architectureCategory:Roman fortifications in GermanyCategory:BurgenlandkreisCategory:Former populated places in GermanyCategory:Roman fortifications in HesseCategory:Archaeological sites in BavariaCategory:Caves of Lower SaxonyCategory:Roman fortifications in Lower SaxonyCategory:AugsburgCategory:Archaeological type specimensCategory:Archaeological discoveries in the Baltic Sea regionCategory:BurgenlandkreisCategory:Upper SaxonyCategory:Roman sites in GermanyCategory:Artificial rock formationsCategory:Human remains (archaeological)Category:3rd-century establishments in the Roman Empire	0
Spain is officially clear of Ebola, the World Health Organization declared Tuesday, after no new cases Ã¢ÂÂ no new confirmed deaths Ã¢ÂÂ from the virus have been reported in the country since an outbreak ended last month.The WHO declared a complete end to the epidemic, or "phasing out," a period when an outbreak is supposed to end for one or a few countries."It is a good day for Spain and for the World," WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Twitter. "We have a long way to go before we can say we have won the fight against Ebola."Spain has been in mourning from public health officials, who said they would never forget the people they had lost."We lost more than 50 people in Spain because of a disease that is not ours," Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said. He was referring to the death of nine members of his family who were infected with the virus in March.Spain is in the second phase of the outbreak - where the virus is no longer widespread but is circulating widely and spreading to unaffected parts of the country.While Spain has been in a phase of no new cases since the outbreak ended, the virus is still spreading, and some countries have declared an emergency over it.In Liberia, where an Ebola treatment center was set up this week, a woman who was admitted onto the same hospital and became infected with the virus is in a critical condition, officials said."She lost more than half of her body mass due to malnutrition and extreme dehydration," Senegalese ambassador to Spain Moustapha Kamara said.In Guinea, where two nurses were released from the hospital where they were being treated after a brief hospitalization to make their way to Liberia for treatment, the Ebola crisis has begun to spread to the other provinces, officials said.In Sierra Leone, a woman who had been admitted to a hospital and was the patient to whom the nurses had fled is now the only known case of Ebola in the country, officials said. Officials said a Liberian man who recently returned from a trip to Spain contracted the virus while staying in Spain for five days, but their situation as of Monday morning has not been clarified.In Mali, the World Health Organization said Monday it was investigating "a case with links to the Ebola outbreak in Guinea."	0
Your cooking partner is a robot, your fridge can talk, and your plate is your own personal dietician. Oh, and for a laugh you occasionally have a cook-off with a famous holographic chef. This may sound like a scene from 1960s sci-fi cartoon The Jetsons, but the kitchens in coming decades may not be so far off those envisioned by futurologists. Today, a number of significant developments in culinary tech are happening in the field of robotics. CNN's Blueprint team caught up with a group of design students in Poland who recently programmed an industrial robot -- usually tasked with building cars -- to cook. Read more: Making gourmet meals out of maggots "Our project is called 'Let's cook the future' and we try to cook with robots -- we had a robot that initially was made just to be in factories and make cars and we tried to treat it as a human and put it in the kitchen." Says Barbara Dzaman, one of the students involved in the project. The 'Let's cook the future' robot "prints" cookies three-dimensionally, building them up layer by layer in almost any shape you could imagine. Dorota Kabala, an industrial designer working alongside the students says that the project looks towards a future where people can make dishes that are only limited by their imagination. "The problem we are addressing in this project is the need for personalization of production ... at the moment we can observe that people need more personalization, more customization of products than before and now it's possible." Marek Cecula, a respected Polish designer, ceramicist and visiting professor at the Royal College of Art, London, says that he was "amazed" by the students' robot chef but felt that "we simply don't know where this is going ... How will we relate to objects made completely by a machine? How will these objects relate to our emotions? Where will the relationship between person and object be when the object is made by a machine?" The introduction of robots into the home is not new, of course. Many of us already live with electronics that have robotic components, such as self-cleaning ovens, single-touch microwaves that automatically adjust to the food you have put in them, and fridges that scan used-by dates.	1
Transit officials in San Francisco reopened all downtown subway stations Monday evening after successively opening and closing them to stem the threat of spreading protests. "All BART Stations are Now Open, Trains Running On Time," said a release from Bay Area Rapid Transit. The situation was fluid most of the evening, with officials trying to thwart demonstrators, closing and reopening the Civic Center and Montgomery stations, closing the Powell station, then at least partially reopening Powell to allow riders to disembark. Police officers in response gear stood at the Civic Center station, with one officer on a megaphone telling people, "This is your final warning, the station is closed." On the streets, small groups of protesters could be seen gathering to criticize BART after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45-year-old Charles Hill. Meanwhile, an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week. The decision Thursday to "temporarily interrupt ... service at select BART stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform" drew widespread criticism and stirred the well-known hacking group Anonymous to stage an "operation" Sunday. The group urged those supporting its cause to attend a "peaceful protest" at 5 p.m. Monday at the system's Civic Center stop. "What we're going to do is take the appropriate steps within the Constitution," he said. "There are more constitutional rights than just free speech. There is the right to be safe." Last week's protest never materialized. But the decision to cut cell service elicited fresh condemnations from civil liberty organizations, the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page and others. "All over the world people are using mobile devices to organize protests against repressive regimes, and we rightly criticize governments that respond by shutting down cell service, calling their actions anti-democratic and a violation of the rights to free expression and assembly," Rebecca Farmer from the ACLU's northern California office wrote on the advocacy group's website. "Are we really willing to tolerate the same silencing of protest here in the United States?" Online messages attributed to Anonymous took credit for the apparent hacking Sunday of myBART.org, a link off BART's website that showed a page featuring, among other items, the hacking group's logo -- a smirking mask above two crossed swords, all on a black background.	1
For Shona Holmes, simple pleasures such as playing with her dog or walking in her plush garden are a gift. Canadian Shona Holmes, who had a brain tumor, sought medical care in the United States. After suffering from crushing headaches and vision problems, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor four years ago. She was told if it wasn't removed, she could go blind or even die. "They said to me that you had a brain tumor and it was pressing on your optic chasm and that it needed to come out immediately," Holmes said. Holmes is Canadian, but the "they" she refers to are doctors at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, where she turned after specialists in her own government-run health care system would not see her fast enough. "My family doctor at that time tried to get me in to see an endocrinologist and a neurologist," Holmes recalled. "It was going to be four months for one specialist and six months for the other."  Watch Holmes talk about her experience in getting treatment » Even with the warning from U.S. doctors in hand, Holmes said she still couldn't get in to see Canadian specialists. Because the government system is the only health care option for Canadians, she says she had no choice but to have the surgery in the U.S. Her treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona cost $100,000, and she and her husband put a second mortgage on their home and borrowed from family and friends to pay for it. When she recounts that part of her painful story, she weeps. "That's the stuff that I find so tragic -- having dinner with my friends and I know how much money I owe them," Holmes says, tears streaming down her face. With the health care reform debate raging in the U.S., Republicans in Washington are seizing on Holmes' story and other accounts from Canada to warn against government involvement in the health care system. The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asserted several times on the Senate floor last month that a government-run health insurance option, which President Obama and Democrats want, could lead to a government-controlled health care system like Canada's. Watch McConnell talk about Canada's health care system McConnell singled out Kingston General Hospital in Ontario as a prime example of what Americans should be fearful of: staggering delays in treatment.	1
If the moon looks a little bit bigger and brighter this weekend, there's a reason for that. It is. Saturday's full moon will be a super "perigee vernal," which means that it will be nearly overhead. On Sunday, the moon will rise at sunset before heading back out toward the horizon.Super moon, super sunsetThe moon will be visible at sunset on Sunday, Jan. 10, but you can see it easily right now, as the sky is overcast.But the moon's location will have a big impact on the timing of its appearance."The moon will appear as a bright orange ball rising in the east around 10 p.m. local time on Saturday," NASA said in a statement (with videos)."It will appear a little bit bigger, but not by much. It will appear higher in the sky than usual, up to a few degrees or so, and it will be near its perigee at perigee," NASA added."That perigee occurs around 1 a.m. local time on Sunday and it will be a super vernal, meaning it will be near or over the horizon of the Sun at that time, so it'll appear larger than usual," NASA said.To view the moon through the night, look toward the brightening southern horizon and look for the moon to rise on its side, and then follow the light of the rising moon back to the horizon — the moon will be nearly overhead, as seen from New York.To be sure to see the moon in its full glory, though, you don't need to look so close. The moon will still be a bright orange through the night sky, as the sky is not entirely overcast this time around.The moon reaches its full extent at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday. On that day, the moon will rise between 1:30 p.m. and 1:40 p.m., and then appear "much brighter than usual" for the day, NASA said."Because it is about half illuminated by the Sun at that time, the moon will appear a brighter orange than it ordinarily does," NASA said. "By noon, it will reach its last quarter and its full phase. The Earth will be nearly at its closest point to the moon at sunset on Sunday, so you should notice it through the night	0
Police Wednesday arrested the suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad following a two-day manhunt after he eluded police by crawling through sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports. Italian police examine a sewer that may have offered an escape route for a suspected mafia boss. Giuseppe Setola, 38, was arrested near Caserta north of Naples, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency and reports in the La Repubblica and Corriere Della Sera newspapers. "This is a great moment for the (Italian) state," Naples anti-Mafia prosecutor Franco Roberti told ANSA after Setola's arrest. "We were certain (Setola) was in a situation of great difficulty. We promised all the citizens that he would be caught. We have kept that promise." Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to the reports. That tunnel connects to the sewer system in Caserta. Corriere published photos of anti-mafia police searching through what was described as Setola's trash-strewn bunker and the tunnel. Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and had already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports. Monday was the third time he avoided arrest. Setola is allegedly the head of a killing team run by the powerful Casalesi clan which belongs to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into that ruling. Corriere published a photo of Setola wearing sunglasses with his left eye bandaged. The Casalesi clan is featured in the best-selling book "Gomorrah" -- a play on the word "Camorra" -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. Saviano recently said he may have to leave Italy to escape constant death threats from the mafia and its supporters. Police began cracking down on Setola and his colleagues after the murder of six West African immigrants in the nearby town of Castel Volturno in September. After those killings, the Italian government activated the army to help bolster efforts against the Casalesi clan, which is believed to have killed more than 20 people since May.	1
Michael Jackson, the show-stopping singer whose  “Smooth Criminal” and “This Is it” songs defined the 1980s, was one  music  icon  who was most famous for a particular song at least once.As he was preparing for his comeback concert at London’s Earls Court Stadium in April, the king of pop was approached by a reporter who asked him for a song-by-song look at his comeback. “I don’t know the lyrics to this,” he replied. “Can I read to you?”The “Thriller” mega-stardom proved, to many, that there was no one quite like Michael Jackson. In his time, the man known simply as “Jackson” had appeared on American television programs, appeared on stage at Madison Square Garden, and appeared in movies like the 1982 James Bond blockbuster “The Spy Who Loved Me.” Yet, in his hometown of Chicago he was only the second African American to make a success of recording. The first was a guy by the name of Elvis, who made a record called “Hound Dog” in 1954.Jackson’s “Thriller” music video was also the most talked-about music video of the decade. With its “Let’s get it on” soundtrack blaring, the music video went on to earn over $60 million in sales.But despite the attention, Jackson himself did not receive much credit for the song. When I sat down with him, he could not recall the name of the song and insisted he would have to listen to it again to remember it. Of course, his memory of the song and the fame and fortune that came with it were short-lived.As Jackson prepared to release his fourth album, “Thriller,” it was clear to many that his music was not the kind of thing that would be able to withstand the test of time. He was one of the most popular pop artists of the era, but his music was “trash rock,” as his friend and colleague Quincy Jones described it on the cover of one of his studio albums.That was, of course, a problem for both Jackson and his record label: Warner Bros. Records, owner of the pop mega-stard	0
Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama. There's the Obamacare website fiasco. Ongoing allegations of National Security Agency spying on European leaders. There was the government shutdown that damaged the economy on his  birthday. And now the FBI is investigating possible coordination between the Obama White House and the anti-Trump “resistance.”But Obama was not going to face these issues and his approval ratings have never taken a hit faster. In fact, over the past few months, they have grown rather stable and robust. And the main reason is that the main issues have been about Trump’s “dysfunction,” his “poor judgment,” and his “incompetence.” They have not been about Obama's shortcomings and character flaws.While there are a few reasons Obama's approval ratings have remained strong, like the “resistance” opposition to Trump, in large measure they are rooted in Obama's character and not in his faults.A look at Obama's strengths and weaknesses to determine why he remains so popular will show that he is very similar to Trump in many ways. And we are not talking “electability” here. This article does not suggest that Obama's popularity is going to continue to grow as Trump's does. But the two have one thing in common.They both have a “mixed bag” and a “glass half-full” version of their strengths and weaknesses. Both have strength and weaknesses based on both character and facts. And Trump and Obama are both trying to use these strengths and weaknesses to their advantage.Obama and Trump have been polar opposites but they are similar in many ways.Strengths, Character and the “Glass Half-Full” and “Mixed Bag”Both Obama and Trump have been the recipients of very public, national attention since their first terms in office. They were both elected by the so-called “less popular” candidate in the primaries. Neither made friends easily in the process.Obama went from being a relatively unknown Illinois senator to being the first mainstream president to be so publicly disliked for so long. He went from being the youngest American president elected to being the oldest, being the first one to be born in Hawaii, being the first to have a father in the White House.And he did all this while	0
As they make a final push to approve presidential nominations before Republicans take control of the Senate, Democrats said Tuesday the confirmation of a record number of federal judges was evidence they were right to make controversial ersatz picks that have put them at odds with House Republicans.The Democrats’ new Senate majority has been dogged by internal divisions on a number of fronts during this administration. One key division will be where it stands on the Trump administration’s federal judiciary. Trump has been criticized by civil rights advocates for nominating judges who have said the Trump administration can end up discriminating against gay, lesbian or transgender people.But Senate Democrats said during their campaign that they would oppose any nominee who said the administration was not committed to protecting civil rights, a position that led Trump to pledge during the election that they would not “impose” their agenda on the Supreme Court.For some observers, that position has come to mean that the high court will be a battleground, with the Senate having the final say on nominations.Many Democratic senators have argued that the Senate has little to do with enforcing civil rights, and can best do that through changing the structure of the American judiciary rather than changing its personnel.A handful of Democratic senators already have expressed concerns about Trump’s judicial picks, including Sens.

In this case, BFF could stand for "Bigtime Famous Friends." The first lady turns 50 on Friday, and it's being reported that she will be serenaded by singer Beyonce for the occasion. The White House is not commenting on whether the singer will be in attendance for Michelle Obama's birthday party, but it's well known that the pair are friends. The superstar performed the Etta James classic "At Last" at President Obama's first inaugural ball and teamed up with Michelle Obama for her initiative to get children more active. Who can forget FLOTUS dancing to Beyonce's "Move Your Body" exercise theme? Even their spouses are friends. Rapper Jay Z changed the lyrics to his rap song to say "I've got 99 problems but Mitt ain't one" during an Obama fundraiser. In July, the first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha attended a Beyonce concert in Chicago. The singer even once wrote an open letter of admiration: "Michelle, thank you so much for every single thing that you do for us. I am proud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you to look up to." Michelle Obama responded, "@Beyonce Thank you for the beautiful letter and for being a role model who kids everywhere can look up to. --mo" Awwwww! Their friendship has not been without controversy, however. Some Christian mothers were reportedly upset over FLOTUS teaming up with Beyonce because of the singer's "booty shaking" and revealing outfits. Writing for the Daily Beast, journalist Allison Samuels noted that there was "the unfortunate conundrum posed for Mrs. Obama." "When BeyoncÃ© goes into the studio to record an album for her millions of fans, she's not thinking about her friendship with the first lady; she's thinking about what's hot, what's edgy, and what will sell to the masses," Samuels wrote. "That surely must have been her mindset when she recorded the controversial lyrics single "bow down b**ches" for her new album earlier this year." Demetria L. Lucas from the Root wrote, "This love fest has gone too far for my liking. I'm no one (and neither are you) to police the first lady's musical tastes, but this continued public endorsement of Houston's Finest rubs me the wrong way. I am not a Bey hater, but I am an observant onlooker."	1
Singer Marc Anthony filed divorce papers Wednesday, seeking to officially divorce his wife of 16 years, singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson. Clarkson, who has not appeared publicly since Dec. 20, has been on tour with Michael Jackson following the couple's three-year marriage. The couple have one child. During the year that they married, Clarkson has recorded six studio albums and appeared in a number of feature films and television programs. The singer earned a Grammy Award nomination for her duet with Jackson on "This is space" in 1996. Before that, the two had a brief relationship as young adults. Clarkson had filed for divorce in the state of Washington, where she lives. The singer was required to leave the state under a temporary restraining order that was entered in late January. Her lawyer, Timothy Waller, said Clarkson was trying to end the marriage because she felt their relationship was "festering" beneath the surface.    ?	0
It had all the elements of an irresistible story, but ultimately it was too good to be true. A popular celebrity. Breathless media chronicling his every move. And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new neighbor. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations. They convinced the media that the newly formed Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition wanted no part of Bieber setting up his new digs in the midst of their old-money mansions. "The Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition is an organization put together by 'the Regular Guys Show,' " host Larry Wachs admitted Monday after the show's cast completed its "protest" in front of an on-the-market mansion. The Regular Guys' Tim Andrews played the role of Harold White, becoming the face of the fictitious protest, doing interviews with CNN, the BBC and a host of other news outlets. "@theregularguys show got 33 international media outlets including TMZ to generate 45,000 plus news stories," Wachs claimed on air. Andrews, as White, claimed to be a retiree and long-time resident in his interview with CNN. "We're concerned he'll bring the wrong type of element into a quiet, residential area," he said over the weekend. "It is our position that a person with his means could certainly find a neighborhood more suited to his eclectic lifestyle." The ploy also included a fake wife he said started a Facebook page to organize the protest. It warned that "Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community. Some can't even let their children play in the driveway without fear; he has raced vehicles under the influence, before. What's to say he won't do it again?" After the mock disgust, the Regular Guys were all smiles on Monday. "That's a big win," Wachs said of the prank. "That's a huge win." They marveled at how eager news organizations were to report the story, missing the potential warning signs of new Twitter and Facebook accounts. "And the great thing was, only one outlet kind of thought it was a troll, and that was Creative Loafing," Wachs said.	1

Ryan Giggs' career as a player-manager got off to a winning start as Manchester United defeated relegation-threatened Norwich City at Old Trafford. The United legend is temporarily at the helm of the Red Devils after David Moyes was  sacked on Monday, and has already shown he has a lot of knowledge of the club."I was on the plane from Italy with the team over two days ago and saw a lot of the squad," Giggs said on the United website."I think we are building up a very good team. We have got the right ideas of how to play football at the moment and I think we will be a good club in the next three or four years."Giggs has been involved in several management roles in his time, and has had a lot of success in both the league and the U.S. Open Cup."I have always enjoyed managing," Giggs said. "There's been so many teams that have had great success since I've been in management. And that's how I got on in my first football job, playing for Leeds United and then managing a team in Italy."I played for Arsenal before I was in management for West Ham United so I know that team at a really young age but I never thought I wanted to manage after that."Giggs spent the majority of his playing days with Arsenal, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1991, but spent a few years at Leeds United, where he became a fan favorite, winning the First Division title in 1995 and finishing runners-up in the competition the following season.A tough defender during his time as a United player but he would also often be on the losing end. He joined Arsenal for £800,000 after leaving Leeds and was made captain for a spell.Giggs, who spent three successful seasons at the club, was sent out on loan to West Bromwich Albion but left in 1997 to join Italian side Inter Milan for £2 million, playing in the Coppa Italia. He spent three seasons at Inter, making 60 appearances for the club."I like Inter. The fans are good. There's a lot of passion and they enjoy a tough contest as well," Giggs said. "I was at Inter in my second season and I was so happy. The fans were so happy for me. It was the first time in a few years that the fans thought I	0

(CNN) -- The most important lesson on terrorism of all time comes to us on September 11, 2001. You might ask: Why didn't an experienced counterterrorism professional, after reading every possible source of raw intelligence, conclude that there was a plot? Why did the FBI, after months of searching, find nothing to link the suspected hijackers to al Qaeda? Why did the CIA, after years of reporting on al Qaeda, not conclude that Osama bin Laden was the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks? And why didn't the President of the United States ask the two most successful and dangerous terrorist groups in the world to surrender?Why did I tell you all this? Because, although I still don't have an answer, the FBI failed miserably in the war on terror. The result of their mistakes has been an increase in terrorism of incalculable magnitude.The FBI did a poor job of protecting us from terrorism from 1998 to 2001. In the year and a half after 9/11, U.S. counter-terrorism officials missed about 90 percent of the 9/11 attacks. Our intelligence services were even less sophisticated in the war on terror in 2001: They missed about 80 percent of the attacks. For years, the FBI had failed to track the movements of the al Qaeda suspects.The FBI missed them because the most important thing the FBI does is hunt down terrorists. Its job is to track groups of people who may be planning attacks. As a matter of policy, the FBI does not even conduct random raids on terrorist training camps. But the FBI has been so badly outgunned that it has become a reactive force, not a proactive one. It has become too often content to track the movements, but never the intent of the terrorists. Indeed, its counterterrorism operations have become so reactive that the intelligence community has recently started to refer to U.S. counter-terrorism officials as "reactive" when they detect a terrorist plot.The FBI missed the 9/11 terrorist attacks	0
Friends and family gathered Sunday for an emotional prayer vigil for a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl as new surveillance video surfaced from the night Lisa Irwin disappeared. The video, taken from a BP gas station less than two miles from the home where Lisa was last seen, shows an unidentified person walking along the road around 2:15 a.m. October 4. The station manager, Anuj Arora, said it's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the region. Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl. The FBI and Kansas City police declined to comment on the video, citing the ongoing investigation. Meanwhile Sunday, Lisa's parents, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, were seen wiping away tears at the candlelight vigil outside their home. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with Lisa's image. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Jeremy Irwin came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. A cadaver dog searching the family's home indicated a positive "hit" for the scent of a body, according to documents released Friday. The information was included in an affidavit, dated Tuesday, police filed to request a search warrant of the home. The warrant was executed Wednesday. "The cadaver dog indicated a positive 'hit' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of Bradley's bedroom near the bed," the affidavit read. It also said that interviews with people involved in the case "revealed conflicting information" and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she "was afraid of what she might find." The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was "unfortunate," as it could derail the search for the missing girl. Joe Tacopina described his clients as "very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive." He said Lisa's parents are "terrified, not for themselves, but for the welfare of their daughter."	1
A British military health care worker in Sierra Leone has tested positive for Ebola, a UK health agency said. Medical experts are assessing what to do next, Â as cases are mounting in West Africa.Dr David T. Atkinson was working with the Ebola treatment team in Freetown's isolation centre on Sunday.The team at Freetown's main hospital treats more than 600 patients at a time. â€œWe are doing everything we can to contain the spread of the virus," said Freetown's chief medical officer, Dr Josephine Fadare.An initial team on a US military plane flew into Freetown on Sunday, where they spent three nights. â€œWe know we are vulnerable to this [virus] and we have to be alert to the risks," Dr Fadare said.The US military is set to send an additional three military aircraft to Sierra Leone, which has about 4,000 cases of Ebola â€” a far slimmer number than the more than 2,000 cases in the worst-affected countries.Ebola has killed more than 3,200 people in West Africa â€” about 930 of those in Sierra Leone, the worst-hit country. â€œFreetown is a city of more than 13 million people. When you add that into the fact it is also our largest referral centre for patients, we are doing everything and having to work in close collaboration with our local partners, as the risk of a transmission event rises," said Dr Fadare.The virus has spread quickly in Sierra Leone â€” which has a population of about 4 million. The country has two main hospitals, and most of the cases in Freetown are being treated there.Ebola has now spread to Freetown and is being transmitted among both local staff and patients. This is the first time this has happened in Sierra Leone.A total of 23 people have died and 756 have become infected. Of those infected, 907 are being treated in Freetown. â€œWe have about 2,000 patients in Sierra Leone in both the isolation centre and the main hospital. We are working round the clock to ensure the health and protection of our patients,â€ said Dr Fadare.ÂThe Freetown isolation centre is	0
It wasn't the screech of cannonballs, the thud of grappling hooks or the crack of muskets that most terrified the sailors of the Spanish Armada in the 16th century, but fire. The English vice-admiral Sir Francis Drake  made a point of naming his fire-ship the Drake, and as he sailed around the world he also launched the largest ship yet built.Drake was an early seafarer. He took to sea at the age of just 16 and, after his father's death, went from sea to sea. His travels took him as far as Russia, China, Japan, New Guinea, the Cape of Good Hope and the Iberian Peninsula.What Drake saw was remarkable, not just for the size of his ship but for its use of wood instead of iron. The Drake is often described as the first vessel that used iron nails and not chains for her moorings.The name ship Drake did not mean that he had sailed to find the fabled Golden Fleece. It was named by his contemporary, the explorer Sir Walter Ralegh, who had just returned from a voyage in the Pacific. In the 18th century, Ralegh told his friend the Lord High Admiral of Britain (or the Queen of England) that his prize ship, the Endeavour, had sailed round the world.The Endeavour was a 64-gun three-decker ship with a crew of about 700 sailors and a number of marines who had accompanied him. It was in the 18th century that the term "sea dog" began to replace the name sailor.Drake's crew made it halfway around the world - about 2,000 nautical miles - in just eight months. He went on to sail to the southern tip of South America and back, where he discovered gold at a place called Antelope Creek.After returning to the West Indies he captured the famous Spanish treasure ships, the Santa Gertrudis and the Recandola. He also captured the small Dutch vessel St Jago.His second journey was to North America, when he sailed north around the coast of Massachusetts. He arrived at the port of Providence after a seven-year voyage.He went around Cape Horn and sailed round the world again, this time around the southern hemisphere. On his return he found that the New World was empty. Columbus was right. The	0
Immigrants in Illinois without a valid visa or green card could soon carry one form of state-issued documentation -- a driver's license -- thanks to a law signed Monday by the governor. The bill could affect about 250,000 drivers who traverse iced-over stretches of the state. The new law allows the Department of Public Aid, in conjunction with the Illinois State Police, to turn over the same identification documents for green cards to people holding provisional or temporary immigrant visas or to those who are eligible for a driver's license. The state's driver's license law for those without a valid form of ID dates to July 2007, when Republicans regained control of the lower chamber of the state legislature.The law would help bring some much-needed stability to Illinois' immigrant population. It would require ID for all drivers in the state by August 2011.The Illinois bill is expected to clear both chambers of the legislature and be signed in to law by Gov. Pat Quinn in the coming weeks. The measure would be subject to a 15-day comment period if it doesn't."This bill is just what we need to do to bring some order to the chaos out there," said state Sen. Bill Brady, R-18th. "I am proud to author the driver's license law for Illinois because I want to make sure there is an ID available to every citizen. With this law we can protect the integrity of the ID, and that's what this is all about."The new legislation could affect an estimated 250,000 people who travel over iced-over stretches of the state at a time when Illinois is already dealing with a shortage of available ID for its citizens.The state is trying to help the temporary immigrant population by allowing them to hold provisional or temporary visas as long as they seek permanent legal residency. As of May 9, there are about 40,000 people on those temporary visas. Of those, 26,000 are in Chicago, according to officials."It can be very difficult, sometimes, to find a driver's license for an immigrant. It's a lot of paperwork, and it's a lot of liability," said state Sen. Heather Matson, Senate Pro Tem. "With this bill, we can actually bring some order to the chaos out there." The bill would be the first of its kind in the nation.With the new law, the state would no longer require immigrants with temporary visas to present	0
Now that President Obama has taken a public stand on the warlords and militia gangs tyrannizing DR Congo, there is a sense that the next chapter in the human tragedy that has been raging there over the past decade and half is about to be written -- or so we can hope. In the DRC -- Africa's largest sub-Saharan country -- invasions, proxy wars and humanitarian crises have senselessly shut down millions of lives, displaced millions more from their homes and left countless women and young girls brutally raped with the world barely raising an eyebrow. The latest murderous attempt by the M23 militia gang to besiege Goma, the strategic regional capital of Congo's eastern province of North Kivu, seems to have backfired. The United Nations says Rwanda has helped to create and militarily supported M23. Although Rwandan President Paul Kagame denies backing M23, the accusation has taken off some of the international gloss he had long enjoyed in the West, and precipitated cuts and suspension of aid money that goes directly to the Kagame regime by the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Britain and the European Union. The United States, which gives no money directly to the Rwandan government, suspended its military aid. In a baffling expression of a refinement of the U.S. position, President Obama made a rare telephone call to Kagame to emphasize "the importance of permanently ending all support to armed groups in the DRC." That set a firm red line on the situation in that region, the first one by President Obama since becoming president in 2008. Watch video: Kagame on Congo This was certainly right and good. Kagame is no fool; the diplomatic but emphatic content of that telephone call, monitored by White House's National Security staff and published thereafter for public consumption, speaks volumes. He clearly understood the implicit threat. But it was not good enough. Left unsaid is that withholding aid money that goes directly to the Kagame regime has not changed many realities on the ground -- a painful reminder of the limits of what previous half-hearted, ambivalent international attempts to halt the crisis in that country had achieved. However, the situation is not hopeless. President Obama can help to halt the wars engulfing the Congo. It is both economically and politically affordable.	1
The 30th anniversary of "The Ghostbusters" just became sweeter. In honor of the movie's landmark anniversary this past June, Legacy Recordings is releasing a limited edition vinyl of Ray Parker Jr.'s theme song that comes wrapped in a marshmallow-scented jacket. Yes, you might still have the "Ghostbusters" soundtrack on a cassette somewhere, but does it smell like marshmallows? That's the important question. (Obviously, the sugar-scented product is to jog your visual memory of the adorable-but-terrifying Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.) For those who can't resist the call of a collectible's item that smells like candy, they'll also get Run-DMC's "Ghostbusters" rap on the 12" single. With a new, rebooted "Ghostbusters" movie on the way, it'll be interesting to see whether either of those classic tracks makes it in to writer/director Paul Feig's new film. New 'Ghostbusters' to star women The "Bridesmaids" helmer announced last week that he was working on a third "Ghostbusters" installment that would include some "hilarious women," and confirmed that the project won't be a sequel. "My favorite thing to do is work with funny women. I was like, what if it was an all-female cast? If they were all women? Suddenly, my mind kind of exploded: that would be really fun," Feig told Entertainment Weekly after his announcement. "And then I thought, well, what if we just make it new? It's not coming into the world that existed before. ... I wanted to come into our world where there's talk of ghosts but they're not really credible, and so what would happen in our world if this happened today?"	1
Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield, from which they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber. The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela's Libertador military airfield and "will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base," Interfax reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry. Col. Alexander Drobyshevsky, a ministry spokesman, told Interfax that NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic. "All flights by air force aircraft have been and are marked by strict conformity to the international rules on the use of air space over neutral waters," Drobyshevsky told Interfax. The U.S. will monitor the Russian training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the information. On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. Russia on Monday denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington. Earlier this month, Chavez said Venezuela would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti. "If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either. We will also welcome them," Chavez said on September 1, according to Novosti.

The Obama administration made public all information available throughout the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday in response to a preliminary report that criticized how it handled the disaster. "This was an unprecedented environmental disaster met with an unprecedented federal response which prevented any of the worst-case scenarios from coming to fruition," Gibbs told reporters when asked about the report made public the previous day. "When we had information, we gave it to the public." According to the working paper released Wednesday from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, the administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf after the April 20 oil rig explosion that caused the disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies. The explosion claimed 11 lives and led to more than 60,000 barrels of oil being spewed into the Gulf daily for almost three months. According to the working paper, the White House Office of Management and Budget squelched higher worst-case estimates accepted by government officials, preventing the public from hearing them. In addition, the commission staff sharply criticized later White House estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up, burned or naturally dispersed, saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer-reviewed by scientists. Gibbs acknowledged that some mistakes were made, in particular citing comments regarding the estimated oil dispersal by former White House environmental adviser Carol Browner in one of "hundreds" of interviews she gave. However, he insisted that the administration worked with the information available at all times, noting that it was impossible to see or measure the oil spill rate in the initial weeks after the explosion. "Throughout this process, we got better information," Gibbs said. "When the rig exploded and the blowout preventer failed 5,000 feet below the ocean, nobody could see what happened." The installation of video cameras and other technology improved the ability to estimate the spill flow in ensuing months, Gibbs said. At the insistence of Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the administration required BP to install pressure monitors to provide the "best available data on the flow rate," he added.	1
An Israeli soldier was killed Sunday in a shooting along the Israel-Lebanon border, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The soldier was treated at the scene, then evacuated to a hospital.

A dead neighbor. Headless dogs. And a millionaire on the run. All set against a backdrop of spectacular tropic beauty. It would be difficult to imagine a more intriguing story than the one unfolding in Belize right now. Police there are seeking to question Internet pioneer John McAfee in the killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. Faull, 52, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of the head this month in his home near San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. McAfee, who is not a suspect, has not been seen since. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. CNN was recently granted rare access to McAfee's beachfront property by a former girlfriend, who asked that her real name not be reported. A bizarre visit to John McAfee's pleasure palace in Belize Identifying herself as "Francesca," she said she'd spoken with McAfee since he disappeared, and that he is "frightened for his life." "He's in constant fear, paranoid," she said. "I would say it's because of what he has been through. ... He thinks people are always after him, which they really are right now." The former girlfriend said she doesn't know where McAfee is, except that he is not at home. They communicate by phone, "not often, once a day, or hardly ever," she said. On Saturday, McAfee apparently began a personal blog, writing posts about being on the run, the media's portrayal of him and what he calls "harassment" by the Belize government. "I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog ... and see the ugly truth unfolding here," reads one post that names six people he says have been detained by police in the case, including friends and household staff. CNN cannot confirm the blog's authenticity. Francesca pointed out buildings as she walked around McAfee's compound, a luxurious sprawl of screened rooms, pathways and an open air pool. Police have searched the home and, according to witnesses, dug up the remains of McAfee's dogs.	1
The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia "committed a tragic error," but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday. Manrico Â«IolaniThe captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia "committed a tragic error," but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday."My name is Manrico Â«Iolani," the passenger said. "I was on the ship for 11 days, and was rescued yesterday morning by the Italian Coast Guard."Iolani said he felt he had a lot to lose if he were to die, and wanted to live to see his grandchildren grow up."I don't know what's next for those who are still alive, but I know we can't let them down. We should have done better, and we should have saved more people."The Italians need to get to jail for saving me: that's what I told my family the moment I was on the side of the ship," he said. "I can't live in a country that lets so many people die and it doesn't help even when they do."The captain, Carlo Gerosa, has been charged with manslaughter, and his captain, Franco Palma, has been charged with abandoning ship and failing to fulfill his duties.Gerosa and Palma have not been named in Italian media reports.A crew member who was on the vessel for about two months said there was too much confusion among the ship's crew and that passengers had not been properly evacuated."Some people were stuck on the ship, some didn't understand what was happening, some started yelling for help and were rescued by the German coast guard, and some others said they wanted to die, but were not moved by the Italian Coast Guard people," the crew member said.He also said there was too much damage on the ship, and there was still a lot of water in the water, and if there had been more help, the person might not have made it to shore.He also said a ship carrying more than 3,000 passengers and crew had tried to evacuate the ship, and it was stopped before passengers were sent.

Locked inside the gemstone there appears to be a human face. As the jewel is turned it fragments, appearing to be looking in several different directions at once. How the disembodied head, which seems to have a  dark and brooding expression, could be contained inside is beyond me, it's all a mystery!I've added a new image to my original post, of two of the faces that can be seen in the gem, one looking up and one looking down. The reason I've included this image is because as you can see, when the gem is upright, the upper and lower faces are not as far apart, as they would be if the gem were broken open!Here's another shot to indicate the scale of the object when open, as shown in the linked image above.I was not disappointed with the gemstone, the gem was smooth and clear with no damage. I believe it was the size of a small egg.At this point I'd also like to say that I'm very happy that my last two adventures with the gemstone have been to the great enjoyment of all. When the gem is on its side I'd like it to stay that way, but it's not difficult to do. If the gem was in someone's head then they would not be able to use their imagination and see it in this unnatural position.About MeI'm just a guy who enjoys messing with things, especially things that spark my imagination, like magic and science fiction.

Thousands of people are expected to march Tuesday in South Africa to protest a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. Zuma's supporters in the ruling African National Congress party quickly denounced the portrait as a "disgrace.""Do you know who painted that thing on his penis?" asked South African Archbishop Trevor Powell of Johannesburg, who said that it was "the vilest thing in the history of South Africa." "God should have given him a dunce cap."A second portrait of Zuma without a penis was also unveiled at the center of the controversy on Tuesday. Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said that the artist who painted the penis had been fired from his job as an artist, adding that Zuma's office ordered the removal of the offending portrait immediately after learning of its existence. The painting did not appear on the official artist biography of Zuma."There's nothing to see here. It's not Zuma-related. If there was to be something to see, the police would have found it by now," Maharaj said.The controversy began at the weekend when Zuma's office published a photograph on social media of what was originally a photograph of a statue of Nelson Mandela. That picture was then used as cover for an official artist biography of Zuma that did not display his penis.The portrait was pulled from the artist biography on Monday.Zuma's office said that no nude portraits of the president would be created again, and that it would stop using the portrait with its "socially inappropriate content." The portrait caused widespread outrage on Facebook, and Zuma's government swiftly condemned the offending depiction at a time when he was facing an emergency motion to fire the chief justice of South Africa for failing to rule on a challenge to his mandate."The President strongly condemns this disgraceful misuse of his image," the office said in a statement, adding that it was "confident that the President takes this action to demonstrate that the media and politicians must act responsibly."Zuma, the African National Congress (ANC) party leader, and many of its senior officials have been criticized for alleged sexual misconduct. In January 2019, a Dutch court ruled that he had used	0

Boko Haram's elusive leader claimed responsibility for a bombing in Nigeria's capital of Abuja that left dozens dead, but said nothing about the group's reported mass abduction of schoolgirls that occurred the same day as the explosion. A man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau made the comments in a video posted online on Saturday, saying the group attacked a bus station in retaliation for the what he described as the government's collusion with the United States in the killing of Muslims. "This is a prelude," said the man, who wore camouflage and held an AK-47 assault rifle, in the video. In a warning to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, the man said: "Let me be blunt: I am in your city, near you. Find me." Mass abduction The video surfaced the same day that an education official said a Nigerian schoolgirl, who was among the 129 kidnapped Monday by suspected Boko Haram militants, had returned home. Even so, 84 of the girl's classmates remain unaccounted for. A total of 45 girls are now free, according to a statement from Borno State Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kulo. This still unsettled situation began Monday night, when militants engaged in a battle with guards at the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok began herding the girls onto buses and trucks and drove off, authorities said. But some of the schoolgirls managed subsequently to escape, including 14 on Friday and others on previous days, according to Kulo. This is a far cry from the Defense Ministry's previous report that all but eight of the girls had found freedom, a claim that Nigeria's military retracted Thursday. This retraction spurred fervent criticism of the government, with Lawan Zanna -- the father of one of the students -- blasting it as having resorted to "blatant propaganda" by making a "blatant lie." What is Boko Haram? While the mass abduction is extraordinary, violence in the region has been on the rise. That violence was on display Monday when a bomb exploded at the bus station in Abuja during rush hour, killing at least 75 people and wounding more than 100. But nowhere has it been more prevalent that in northeastern Nigeria's Borno, Yobe and Adamawa provinces, which have been under a state of emergency since mid-May due to persistent bloodshed there the government blames on Boko Haram.	1
The phenomenal success of "Modern Family" has been a game changer for its entire cast, including actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson. The show's high ratings, three consecutive Emmy wins for outstanding comedy s, and continued accolades from the Golden Globes have elevated Ferguson to a status he hadn't before experienced. Ferguson is now one of TV's most successful actors.His role as Dr. Luke in the new ABC comedy "Modern Family" has been especially memorable. Luke is the neurosurgeon brother of the show's main character, Jesse, played by Ferguson. Both brothers are played by the same actors, who have been training to take on an impressive cast since the show's inception."I had a role in one episode that was extremely well written," Ferguson says. "I was very happy with the outcome of that day, but I was even happier that 'Modern Family' had a scriptwriter. He's very good. He's been in the business for a long time, and I'm just thankful he put me in the show. He was like, 'I want to put you in a scene where you're with this guy' and he sent it to my agent who sent it to me. And the agent called my manager, and there we were. Two minutes later, they called and said, 'You're on a show called "Modern Family." It's not about you, but we're going to use you.'"Jesse and Luke's relationship is one of love, but it's also one of friendship. The two have become friends during their two-year sojourn in Los Angeles, where the brothers have lived for the past five years. They share an apartment together while the doctor works on his doctorate in neurosurgery at UCLA School of Medicine."We kind of grew up together. I'm a little bit older, but he's a lot older," Jesse says while enjoying a cold drink and sitting in the back of his car. "We talk a lot. We have a lot in common. We're very different personalities. He's a lot more laid-back. But we have a lot in common."They've also bonded over their experiences in the military. "I got to spend two years of my life deployed in Afghanistan. I got to know the guy," Jesse says with a chuckle."What I loved about being part of the military was getting to know	0

CARL AZUZ, CNN ********************* ANCHOR: Tonight, a week after the deadly earthquake in Japan. Millions without power. Many are still there. And tonight after this, a quick look at the recovery and rebuilding effort there. Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi resigning. CNN's Pauline Harris is there. It's the first time in the entire 20 years since the Japanese disaster that a prime minister has resigned. Here's how this recovery is faring, and more from our global bureau in Tokyo, John Donvan, and in New York, Pauline Harris. Good to see you, Pauline. How are you doing? PAULINE HARRIS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much. Well, here in Tokyo, the city of Yokohama, the number one hit by this earthquake was the city of Yokohama, the port -- which has been the center for so much of the Japanese recovery, with Japan's financial center and many of the Japanese electronics companies in the area. But today was the first time for the Japanese government to actually say it wants out of this leadership role, and it's actually moving the role to the prime minister of the country directly after the fact. And I was actually in -- in the government building and saw the Prime Minister Koizumi standing there with his cabinet members. He had resigned and they were going to transfer it to another prime minister. So the leadership role that he really played, the role that he really played was all in his hands. Here's what he said. Prime Minister Koizumi said, my resignation is an expression of my regret. I have already expressed my apologies many times. I also expressed my regret in light of the many lives that were lost. And my government will never forget.September 8, 2010 Download PDF maps related to today's show: • Colorado • Texas • Japan Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mahmoud Abbas, on Wednesday accused Chavez of "declaring the death of the Palestinian cause while at the same time using his diplomatic position to deny the right of Palestine to exist and to recognize the State of Israel as the homeland for the Jewish people." "The recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Palestinian territories was approved by the unanimous vote of the International Court of Justice in 2001, as a result of decades of legal battle that the international community had led against Israel," he added. He also made the threat: Ã³tre mâle sÃ©crétement défendu par la Cour Internationale de Justice mâle.The Israeli government, meanwhile, responded to the diplomatic tensions by extending visa-free travel to Venezuelans on the grounds that the country is trying to improve ties with Latin America's largest nation.Israel is currently in its first international crisis in 22 years, since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

On canvas, Vladimir Putin appears stern, Tony Blair looks relaxed and Junichiro Koizumi smiles broadly. Through paint and brushstroke, former President George W. Bush says he has found not only a rewarding hobby but a ersatz father figure, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was not his father, is presented with a rather more paternal expression.There are differences between these three leaders, to be sure, but they also have the same two faces. They are all in their prime or near-prime years, and so they seem older. Bush’s cheeks are more flushed with self-pity than Obama’s, a hint of the good-natured smile he showed so many times during the campaign. Brown has a few gray hairs, but he looks his age, and he is also more relaxed than Putin, who stands for something he has come to believe in; the notion of a united Europe. It’s all very confusing for those of us who were once young; now our leaders appear older and they are all men.Now Putin comes in, and if not quite young, certainly older. He’s an elderly man, with a white moustache and a gray goatee, so he’s very much in the company of Putin and Putin’s grandfather. If Putin wants to say something, Putin doesn’t need a translation. Putin can always say something: Russia has always been great because no one has ever challenged its greatness.The idea of Russia is deeply rooted in my thinking, but more often in the past than now. Russia has been my father, my mother, my grandfather, my country, my race, my culture, my heart. It represents everything I have ever valued in other people and in nature. Russia is a part of me, and it has always been part of me.That sounds very grandiose, and Putin takes great pride in the fact that, in 2004, he was elected president of Russia. In so doing, he set out to build a new Russia, a Russia that was different and strong, a Russia that could not be dominated, a Russia that would be a model for other countries to follow. On a number of occasions, as a young man in the Soviet Union, he had experienced the same kind of adulation that Putin experienced during his election. This is where the similarity in their expressions ends.	0
The body of an apparent stowaway fell from the wheel well of a plane taking off ileo-first (inside right) at Heathrow Airport while waiting to be cleared to take off.  The stowaway and another passenger climbed out the back of the plane, walked away and then re-appeared on the tarmac in a nearby taxi.  This was in addition to a pilot who was also found wandering on the tarmac.Police called in specialist search dogs. During the afternoon the smell of food was detected in the direction of the taxi but the stowaway was not seen.  During the night a second stowaway was found on the tarmac in the airport's car park with his clothes and passport thrown around him.  It was not clear whether he had any connection with the incident as he was naked.The next day the airport was closed and ileo-first flights were switched to a different runway.ReferencesExternal linksCategory:2012 in EnglandCategory:2012 in aviationCategory:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 767Category:History of the Royal Air ForceCategory:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2012Category:Royal Air Force accidents and incidentsCategory:Disasters in LondonCategory:Royal Air Force operationsCategory:Aircraft landingsCategory:November 2012 events in EuropeCategory:December 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:StowawaysCategory:2012 crimes in the United KingdomCategory:2012 in British lawCategory:2012 scandalsCategory:Transport in LondonCategory:Royal Air Force operationsCategory:Deaths from hypothermiaCategory:2010s crimes in LondonCategory:2010s in the City of WestminsterCategory:October 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:December 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:StowawaysCategory:November 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:October 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:December 2012 events in the United KingdomCategory:2010s crimes in the City of WestminsterCategory:October 2012 events in LondonCategory:December 2012 events in LondonCategory:HMS Queen ElizabethCategory:Accidents and incidents involving British civilian aircraft	0
A judge in New Haven sentenced a 31-year-old man to death Friday for his role in a deadly home invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007. Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in ють‘вгінгывайцеве алейів, where his lawyers claim the killing was an act of self-defense.The killing was the final act in a brutal home invasion spree that came to light in late 2006 after a woman called 911 after she discovered a knife in the family’s home. Police eventually caught up with them and found Komisarjevsky in the home with his wife and daughters.The woman who called police was killed and a second woman was injured in the attack. When police arrived at the house, the three women were dead, Komisarjevsky had a knife, and one gun was missing.The man said he came home the night of the killing and found that his wife and daughters had been taken away by men, who he said were strangers. He claims that they were planning to rape his daughters at gunpoint. He said that as the men walked out of the house, shooting erupted and he heard his wife scream.The man’s story is supported by testimony that he told police. Police also told jurors in their closing argument Friday that the man’s claim that he did not know about the killings was “bordering on delusional.”But jurors could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the man committed premeditated murder when they deliberated for just a few minutes Friday.Klaus-Peter Teufelmeyer, the judge who made the ruling, said the man’s admission that he murdered his daughters is “troubling,” according to reports.“In the court’s view,” he said, “it would be difficult not to think that the accused was trying to minimize his culpability when he made his admissions.”He said he believed the man was “foolish” when he spoke at the trial of the second woman, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was 3 and 4.“He has not been around her for some years now,” he	0
Microsoft has dialed up its competition in the search-engine wars with the introduction of a daily deals facility on Bing. Microsoft knows daily deals are the hottest meme at the moment, so its announcement is suitably cheeky and aggressively street-hawkeresque (we kid): "Calling all bargain hunters, deal lovers, Groupon groupies and Living Social fanatics! Things just got easier" it trumpets, making no bones about mentioning the biggest name in daily deals right now, Groupon, to gin up interest in its service. Bing Deals arrived Thursday on desktop PCs and smartphones (where it's possibly most useful) via Bing's dedicated, simpler, mobile site m.bing.com. It promises to give access to "more than 20,000 unique offers in over 14,000 cities and towns across the U.S." But how has Microsoft managed to amass such a diverse coverage and ad-partnership pool already, you may wonder? The answer is that Bing, unlike Google's more head-on direct competitor efforts, is actually assembling daily deal offers from sites like Groupon, Living Social, Restaurant.com "to name a few" into one location, making it easy to work out where you can find a super-cheap purchase, or perhaps a spontaneous birthday gift for someone. It's using technology from The Dealmap ("a leading source for people to find and share the best local deals") to power its systems, which means as well as location-based deal discovery, you'll also be able to share results with people via email. It seems the system is spread throughout Bing, as well -- if you search for a local restaurant using Bing, then the engine will "make sure you know" about any deals that establishment may have available by listing them directly beneath the business details in the search window. The system appears ideal for consumers previously uninterested in deals sites like Groupon -- which may offset the slight brand erosion each of these individual sites may suffer as their deal offers are wrapped into Bing's front-end UI. In launching daily deals, Bing is stepping up its competition with Google and jumping aboard the (already bursting) daily deals bandwagon. With new data suggesting total revenues from daily deals services could reach as much as $6 billion by 2015 in the U.S. alone, this is a fast-growing market segment that Microsoft simply can't ignore.	1
Terry McMillan writes best-selling fiction, but it was real-life drama -- a very public divorce -- that garnered her some of her biggest headlines. The nasty split with ex-husband Jonathan Plummer, the inspiration for the popular iced-tea brand McEwan Organic, was the subject of interviews, profiles and TV segments before it was made public. Now that the dust has seemingly cleared, with Jonathan P. gone, the author tells AOL.com what’s next for her, what lessons she learned about marriage and how to move on.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Q: Why did you decide to write a book about divorce?A: I did my divorce through a therapist, and he encouraged me to write it and he had experience with the subject. He didn’t discourage my thinking or my exploring the subject, but he definitely said, “You have to be careful of this at some of these points.” I guess I needed to do it if I was going to write it; if I wasn’t going to write it, I might be able to come out of my own issues and not have a lot of conflict with my kids or my husband.Q: What did you learn from the experience?A: I had been married for 9 years when I started writing the book; my husband and I separated after a 7-year marriage. I learned that I could use the best tools I could find to build a secure marriage, including family therapy and getting help to raise my children. I started writing the book because I felt like I needed to talk to someone about it, and I thought if I could explain it in language people might understand I would be able to heal my relationship.Q: What did you learn about marriage from the experience?A: I learned that marriage is about two people who have decided to have a romantic relationship together, and it’s very beautiful when they are able to find that kind of connection. I learned that people are really attracted to people who will put their family and their children first. I learned that people really love each other when they’re able to be open and honest and vulnerable with each other.Q: After your divorce, what do you think your relationship could have been like if it had made it to book?A: My divorce would actually have	0
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Angel Lau adjusts her iridescent blue goggles over her cherubic face, steps to the edge of the pool and dives in head first. The 7-year-old is one of the lucky ones: Her mother enrolled Â­in a class offered through a Hong Kong child advocacy group, where children participate in water-based activities.In Hong Kong, children of low-income parents are eligible for these swimming classes as long as their parents are able to pay. And for two years, Lau was the only child in her class to take advantage of the free class.The pool is a dark, warm space in the small house, filled with an ocean breeze, where the walls are bare brick and the windows are wooden shutters.Lau's mother, a primary school teacher, said her only goal was to ensure their future."The kids will do a lot of things because they are like this," said Lau. "They have such an adventurous nature."On a recent afternoon, the seven-year-old is in her water shoes and swimming goggles and trying to stay above the water."We're going to try this and see if it helps you swim, OK?" Wong Wan Wah, Lau's teacher and the director of the Swim Club, asks.Wong Wan Wah and Lau pose with Angel after the classThe class is a week-long exercise in "environmental living," as Lau puts it. The students are split into teams and assigned to care for some of the surrounding environment, planting flowers and creating waterfalls.After class, Wong Wan Wah takes Lau back into the classroom and gets her a snack."I teach you some of the lessons that are the main reasons why you should take this class," Wong Wan Wah tells her.Angel Lau enjoys the class and being around the other childrenThe class is different from other pool activities run by the Swim Club.Instead of having students dive into the water, students are encouraged to touch the pool, to float on their backs, to swim with their feet. And Wong Wan Wah instructs them all to wear their swim goggles just like Lau's with the red circles on both sides."We like to give them a warm heart and to make them grow up with a lot of joy," Wong Wan Wah said.After Lau had her	0
How hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act? For three 20-year-old programmers in San Francisco, it took about three days' worth of work. Spurred by the problems  they encountered in the early stages of creating their site, they decided to launch the site on June 4 as an experiment.Now, after working on the site for five months, they still need the backing of the federal government to get it up and running and a lot more time to complete the work they need to do.The site they created, GetInsured.org, lets people quickly fill out forms to enroll in health insurance plans with the help of some free tools they were able to build."I think that if we didn't want to do it, we would have created something else for people to have," said Joe Stump, 21, who is the director of the site. "As long as we're doing this, it's worth it."GetInsured, which will be launched in four languages and with more than 50,000 volunteers, gets a lot of flack for letting users register "in the wild" without a lot of government oversight, Stump said.But he says that the site has been vetted by the White House and other key agencies, including health care companies and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.It has also been reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission's health care fraud prevention office.GetInsured's creator, Stump, has been working on the site since he was part of the team responsible for creating an online tool for registering voters in California. The team at GetInsured worked with three coding friends, all now college students: Kyle Kallgren, 20; Alex Rios, 21; and Ben Trommer, 19.All three started work on the GetInsured site while in junior year at UC Berkeley and continued to develop it as they went through their coursework there, said Stump."We all have different interests, but all three of us are very interested in the tech space and are doing something in that space," he said.A few weeks ago, the three programmers met several people to help their site, and they wanted to expand that group to include more people, Stump said."We're definitely looking at expanding the GetIns	0
It appeared an unlikely meeting: Earlier this month, representatives from Hollywood, home of the anything-goes lifestyle and anything-can-happen film, traveled to Iran, where censorship and constant government supervision are a fact of life for the film industry. American actress Annette Bening, right, attends a workshop with Iranian actresses during her stay in Iran. But the two sides had more in common than it would appear, said Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. "It was thrilling to be in Iran, just plain old thrilling," said Ganis. "We talked. ... We spoke the same language, the language of movies." In Iran, "the language of movies" has thrived since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, despite strict censorship laws, said Duke professor Negar Mottahedeh, author of "Displaced Allegories: Post-Revolutionary Iranian Cinema." A number of post-revolution Iranian films have screened at international film festivals, and some, such as Abbas Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry," have won international awards. Creativity and prohibition often have an "intimate relationship," Mottahedeh said, observing that "film cultures have flourished oftentimes when they have been under restrictions." Iran's film association, known as the House of Cinema, was host of the Hollywood trip. The American delegation, which included Ganis, producer Bill Horberg and actress Annette Bening, took part in a cultural dialogue with prominent Iranian screenwriters, actors and directors, sharing their ideas on filmmaking and taking part in workshops and film screenings. "It's hard to get Iranian films distributed in Iran because ... there aren't that many cinemas," Ganis said. "And then, of course, the government intrudes on the process with a certain censorship set of rules and [regulations]." But, citing a recent Iranian film called "About Elly," directed by Asghar Farhadi -- scheduled to be screened at this year's Tribeca Film Festival -- Ganis said Iranian filmmakers are still able to release high-quality films. "We are expecting the Iranian film industry to continue to flourish in terms of the creativity that we saw when we were there," Ganis said. "At the moment, I think [Iranian cinema] does have wide exposure," Mottahedeh said. "I do think that Iranian filmmakers are already thinking about the foreign market."	1
Robin Williams' daughter chose a hummingbird to honor her late father. "For poppo," wrote Zelda Williams on her Instagram account Wednesday, posting ・・・.Actor Robin Williams died in 2017 at the age of 62 after a long battle against pancreatic cancer, but his daughter Zelda still misses him.The comedian won an Oscar for his role as the affable neurotic father in "Mork & Mindy." But, in the film, he was also a man who struggled with a lifelong battle with depression. On the surface, he was a loving father. But behind the scenes, he was also a man who needed his family around him. Before his death, he admitted that he needed to have someone there to take care of him, not just because of his illness, but also because he was struggling with mental health.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Zelda described how she wished her father had seen the struggles she faced in her life before he passed away. It turns out that she has a sister, Sam, who went through a similar ordeal.What can we learn from Zelda's experience as an only child?The story of Zelda's mother, Zelda Williams, was one of one of the most remarkable family stories in Hollywood. She was a single mother of two, and had an unusual child. For her, she created the perfect life for her daughters.Zelda Williams: “When I was growing up, there wasn't a single day that my mother didn't look into every corner of my eye and smile because she loved me so much.”It was not just her mother that she looked for inspiration, but also her father. She said, "He was the single most important figure in my life. He was the person who I looked to first when I had thoughts, or I needed someone to listen. When I was feeling sad, or frustrated, he would always be there."The first time Zelda was told that her dad had died, she had her mother pack her and her sister's things into a suitcase. She said, “We had to walk down to the train station in our winter coats and boots. You never forget a day like that. I remember having to get on the train and go back to Los Angeles after being told that my dad had died.”Since she never met her dad, Zelda only saw him for a few days	0
If this is an indication of what Roger Federer will do at Wimbledon, his opponents had better watch out. Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany. The only other time Federer didn't drop a game in a match was at the year-end championships in 2005 against clay-court specialist Gaston Gaudio. "You never go to court aiming for such a score," Federer, who turns 32 in August, told reporters. "I'm surprised to have managed it today." At Wimbledon, which begins on June 24, Federer will be bidding to advance to a first grand slam final since claiming a seventh title on the Wimbledon grass a year ago. He lost to Tomas Berdych in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last September, Andy Murray in January's Australian Open semifinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in this month's French Open quarterfinals. Federer knows the chances of registering a second consecutive double bagel are slim. He meets local favorite and the man who beat him in last year's final in Halle, Tommy Haas, in the last four. "I expect a completely different opponent tomorrow," Federer said. Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle. "He is one of the greatest of all time, perhaps the greatest," said Haas. Haas, the 35-year-old third seed, rallied from a set down to oust Gael Monfils 6-7 (4) 6-3 6-3. But he was the only German winner on the day. Besides Zverev, sixth-seed Philipp Kohlschreiber and eighth-seed Florian Mayer were also sent packing. French second-seed Richard Gasquet topped Mayer 6-3 7-6 (4) and Russian Mikhail Youzhny beat Kohlschreiber, the 2011 champion, 6-3 6-2. At Queen's Club in London, the other men's warm-up taking place this week, top-seed Andy Murray progressed to the semifinals with a 6-4 7-6 (3) victory over Germany's Benjamin Becker.	1
The South Korean Navy fired warning shots to ward off North Korean fishing boats that were spotted south of the maritime border between the two countries, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Friday. The North Korean vessels crossed back over the border, known as the Northern Limit Line, following the warning shots, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. More: North Korea taunts South candidate with 'Gangnam' video The South Korean Navy issued two warning messages to the North Korean boats before firing a few dozen shots, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, adding that the alert level for the navy had been raised. The were no immediate reports on the incident Friday by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. The two Koreas, which remain technically at war following their conflict in the early 1950s, have periodically clashed at sea over the years, with some waters still in dispute. The land border between the two nations remains heavily militarized. More: North Korea rebuffs aid offer from South Fatal naval skirmishes took place near the inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea in 1999, 2002 and 2009. And in 2010, Seoul accused Pyongyang of sinking one of its naval vessels near disputed waters off North Korea, killing 46 South Korean sailors. North Korea has repeatedly denied responsibility for causing the sinking. South Korea is a key ally of the United States, with tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the country.	1
French police had no grounds on which to arrest gunman Mohammed Merah before he carried out three attacks in which seven people died, Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL Friday. Merah, 23, who was shot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of the most active French-speaking Islamists in EuropeÃ¢â„¢, was shot dead Friday morning at a train station in the suburbs of Paris after a brief stand-off with police. The Associated Press reported Ã¢â‚¬Å“One policeman was killed and another injured in the shootout.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe attacker was a Tunisian national, Fillon said, and is believed to work with radical Islamist groups in France. Ã¢â‚¬Å“He was a terrorist,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Fillon, a member of the center-right UMP party, speaking to RTL.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThis incident has no relation to terrorism,Ã¢â‚¬Â Fillon told RTL.Ã¢â‚¬ÂYou can judge from all kinds of evidence and from pictures.Ã¢â‚¬ÂMerah was wearing a suicide vest when he blew himself up at Reina nightclub in downtown Paris, an attack claimed by the Amedy Coulibaly network. Merah's uncle, Said KÃ¥sani, told the AP that Merah was visiting family in France and had recently studied medicine in Tunisia.Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe police found no evidence of accomplices. He wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t linked to any cell,Ã¢â‚¬Â KÃ¥sani said. The attack, the deadliest strike on French soil since 2006, wounded 29 people. According to AP, Merah was shot in the chest and was taken to an area hospital, where he died a short time later. French President Francois Hollande told the AP that Merah was shot after a 10-minute stand-off with police, who said he was carrying a gun and threatened to kill them. The official said the attacker had been holding a large knife when he was shot. Hollande said that Merah "was the first terrorist I	0
Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride. Athletes' victories on the global stage made us proud of the new China. The new "open" China was full of hopes, dreams and opportunities. A strong, united nation working together to build a better tomorrow was the higher calling for all of us. To serve this calling, many kids who were identified as potential elite athletes were enrolled into the government supported "sports schools." If they trained hard and were talented enough, they would make it to represent their city, their province and then one day their country. When there is a demand, there was also a reward. Chinese Olympic champions were well rewarded through national and local government, both in terms of compensation and social status. Lang Ping, the star of the 1984 women's volleyball team that won a gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, was the Michael Jordan of China. As the son of a sports reporter, I was fortunate enough to know her when I was a kid. The fact that I knew her made me very popular at school, pretty much like telling everybody at school today that Kobe Bryant is your friend. In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games. After this astounding success, many started to ask what's next? Economic growth means that people have more options in terms of career. It is more and more difficult to find kids (and parents) who want to join the "sports school" system and aim for that one-in-a-million shot to become an Olympic gold medalist. Academic performance offers a more certain path to success. Better grades means better universities, better universities means better jobs. At least that has been (and will probably still be for a long time) the belief of many parents and teachers. There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China. A growing urban population and middle class are seeking a better quality of life and personal well-being. In 2013, more than 750,000 people participated in a running competition or marathon, up 50 percent on 2012, according to the China Track and Field Association	1
Prisoners in ice, more than 100 Beluga whales in far eastern Russia risk death unless rescued soon. The flock of gentle ghost-white ursids at the top of their migration has been lost to the dark winter of 2014-2015 that was followed by the mass stranding of two whales in June. With the ice breaking up and drifting southwards, the whales risk being trapped among ice walls. Many will drown, along with at least 100 prisoners. Russian authorities are preparing to launch a rescue mission. The rescue plans include a three-day aerial search for whales. The project is being led by the Russian icebreaker “Gerasimenko”, which arrived in the Far East in September. It is tasked with locating the whales as the first vessel to enter the region. Once the rescue plans have been finalized, more aircraft are expected to join the mission, with the first aircraft expected to fly by late November or early December. At this point, the rescue effort appears to be more or less complete.A rescue mission would involve sending three vessels to find the whales. One would be a floating rescue vessel that would have to cross the thick ice. Another would be a support vessel with a helicopter, and the third would be a fixed wing aircraft. There is an unknown chance that the flying vessel will encounter large ice floes and sink in, killing all those inside. Even if all three vessels are successful, the rescue efforts would take at least three weeks, meaning that the whales would be dead. At this point, the search has come under criticism by wildlife groups. “If they want to do this rescue, they should at least bring a flamethrowing jet and gas masks to the rescue vessels”, commented marine biologist Anna Proskura. Her organization, the Russian Wildlife Conservation Society (Pravo-Zapovednik), has started a “Save the Whales” campaign. “I’d like to make it clear that we are against this plan of the Russian government. They are trying to force these animals to die so that others will be brought up on TV to tell us that the government is protecting our wild animals”, said Proskura.“If we try to move them [the whales] to a different area, the whale would die, too. A lot of people would die. Russia is a country with so many problems and we should think about the country as a	0
A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities  told local media Tuesday.Police said they believed Brian Huggins was driving a truck Wednesday when he pulled over to the side of Highway 18 near Palm Harbor, Fla., and found a dead child inside the truck.The child's birth mother had been arrested for taking her child across state lines to meet her ex-husband, and investigators now believe the child died after being dropped at a car wash as part of a planned crime."He was the last person seen with the victim, and we believe he was driving the vehicle at the time of the death that is now confirmed to have been a homicide," Palm Harbor Police Chief Robert M. "Buddy" McWherter told reporters Tuesday.Police said they received a tip about the potential crime from a woman who said she'd seen the body earlier in the day. Once they got a description of the car washing and learned where it was in the area, they put out an alert, hoping the man would come forward.McWherter said that the vehicle was covered in the child's blood, and police believed there might be additional remains inside.McWherter said they found the body inside the truck and that the driver appeared to be inebriated, according to an arrest record for Huggins that includes several photographs allegedly of the man.According to Palm Beach County records, Huggins' address is 851 East Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach. McWherter said police also collected video footage of a license plate number Huggins may have attached to the truck -- but his truck has since been located by police and is being searched, he said.Huggins has been arrested three times -- once for aggravated battery and once both for cocaine and resisting arrest, records show. Huggins said he got into a fight in 2009 with a man who later pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking cocaine to the child in question. He was arrested a second time in 2014 after he tried to run his car through a red light -- again resisting arrest, records show.Police said the man's ex-husband has threatened to kill Huggins, and police are considering charges of stalking after she filed	0
Qantas has reached a settlement with engine-maker Rolls Royce over a 2010 incident that grounded its entire Airbus A380 fleet. Rolls-Royce agreed to compensate the airline in a deal worth US    per passenger."It had been a very difficult and distressing experience, particularly for the families of our passengers," a Qantas spokeswoman said."The compensation negotiated was fair and generous and reflects the level of distress that was experienced."Qantas is currently in talks with a group of Boeing BA, -0.23% shareholders about a possible takeover of the company.Qantas has also reached an agreement with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that would cover an aircraft repair program at Washington National Airport. The program involves the replacement of Boeing 737s and Airbus A319 aircraft.Rolls-Royce is the largest engine vendor in the world and one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers. It also makes engines for the Airbus and Boeing airlines.In 2010, Rolls-Royce, which has operated a production base in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Australia, was fined for serious breaches in its quality control and procedures.The company admitted the faults were caused by several "lapses in judgment" by Rolls-Royce staff.For its failure to meet regulatory requirements, the company was fined US    per passenger.Qantas said on Wednesday it expected to settle with Rolls-Royce by the end of the year for US    per passenger. This compares to the initial    per passenger fine per case (about US $11.4 million). It was not immediately clear what the settlement would cost Qantas.The fine was the second maximum penalty imposed by the US Department of Transportation against a single company in a single year – the first was US    per passenger to American Airlines AAL, -1.09% , which was fixed to US    per passenger for its US Airways flight.Qantas had been one of the most severely punished US airlines in the last 12 months as the FAA fined US    per passenger on six separate occasions for serious safety violations relating to its Boeing 737 MAX, the second largest Boeing jet with the capacity to fly twice the capacity of the US Airways flight.Shares in Qantas jumped 8.6% to US$	0
His eyes moist and lower lip trembling, Clint Romesha nodded haltingly at family, comrades, military brass and the president standing to applaud him for receiving the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal  of Honor, he finally received.His lips quivered, eyes filled with tears and he choked on words that sprang to his lips. He turned, and walked back into his barracks, not looking back, not even turning to see if his family stood behind him.***Romesha walked like a man walking on a tight rope, and it had to be a tight rope, because he hadn't the strength to walk the fifty yards to the post, the one thing he needed to do.He knew he had to do it, it was part of his warrior heritage and all the military manuals from the Great War taught the necessity of the medal at every stage of military service, from basic training to the most dangerous duty on any battlefield. But in the end, he knew he was never going to be a soldier, never going to be a warrior. He had let go of his dreams of the cavalry and of being some kind of hero in uniform in the American  military. He had let go years before that, though he never knew it until now.He walked as if a part of him was nailed to the ground, as if he could not get up to get his medal, to receive it, and it was very bad to walk, like walking on a tight rope with no chance to get up and get up fast enough.Somewhere in the distance, he heard a gunshot, like a rifle shot, and it came close enough to him that he couldn't miss, so he walked over to the post to receive it, no matter who was firing on him. He walked like a man who was on a tight rope, but with no tight rope on the ground, there was nothing to slow him down, he had to walk like a man who could walk, but whose legs had been nailed to the ground.He couldn't help himself, he tried walking like he was walking on an electric wire, and that got him down to a normal human pace, but he couldn't get up again, the pain in his legs was too much, the tight rope was too tight, and he walked like a man walking on a wire with every step he took hurting his legs.The sniper must have	0

Two former New York Police Department detectives were sentenced to life in prison without parole Friday for operating as Mafia hit men while employed by the NYPD. Louis Eppolito, 60, and Stephen Â Ciminelli, 61, were convicted in a racketeering trial in federal court last year. Â Police officials acknowledged for more than a decade that both were on the payroll of Cosa Nostra leaders, and said in court that Ciminelli had been working with Cosa Nostra boss John Gottiâs men in the 1990âs. Â Prosecutors said their clientsâ job was to collect extortion payments from their victims and to kill them if necessary. Â But defense attorneys in the trial said the pair were just trying to make as much money as possible from their Mafia clientele. Â Each had more than a dozen victims, and was paid at least $1.85 million. Â Both were convicted after the jury found them guilty last year of conspiracy and racketeering. They were arrested in 2005 and indicted on the same charges.<a href="http://www.ponit.com/">ponzi&agrave;</a>Ponzi scheme.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's sweeping health care legislation Thursday in a narrow 5-4 ruling that Obama says will provide up to 30 million additional Americans with health care. America doesn't have universal health  coverage. The ruling provides some relief to millions of uninsured and underserved individuals who have struggled to get affordable health care. But not enough. The health care law's effects across the country, its implications for the political landscape, and the challenges that remain are all still uncertain.The decision by the high court comes on the same day as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was expected to unveil new details of his plan to reform the country's federal budget. The details may provide greater clarity but the biggest question still hanging over the political landscape: What is the effect of the health reform law on the tax code? The health care law is the driving force behind the tax code, and most of the provisions of the tax law will have an impact on insurance coverage and public policies in the future.How and why will the taxes levied by the federal government impact the health reform law?The health care law passed by Congress in March of 2010 contains provisions that will impose new taxes on individuals and employers to finance health coverage for uninsured or underinsured Americans. The law also imposes a significant new obligation on individuals to provide health coverage to their families, which is a major change.So what are the taxes that will be imposed on individuals and employers? And how and why will they influence the health care reform law over the next few years?In a single-payer system, people who seek to purchase coverage from private insurers would have to pay the full cost of their health care rather than getting a subsidy from the taxpayers.The health care law imposes a $1,000-per-person surcharge on individuals who purchase individual policies. A single-payer system would require higher out-of-pocket costs for the individual because the government would be paying the full cost of health care in a public plan.How and why will the taxes levied by the federal government impact the health reform law over the next few years?The taxes levied by the federal government on individuals and employers will have major effects over the next two years on the insurance market, on health care, and ultimately on taxpayers. The most immediate impact is on the amount of insurance coverage offered through the health care law.Who	0
On Sept. 12, 2009, frustrated tea party citizens from across the country marched upon the Capitol in Washington, energized by a shared sense of disenfranchisement in the political system and anger at a federal government they believed was  "corrupt."While that action was successful in inspiring a national movement, the cause-and-effect of the Tea Party movement is much less clear. After a four-year hiatus, the Tea Party's influence is starting to show up in more mainstream news and opinion articles and events. Now, people are taking a new look at the party's role in American politics and how it compares to other protest movements around the world -- and in some cases, they're making a new argument about the country's current problems.The movement began in response to a string of congressional elections that showed tea party-backed candidates winning dozens of congressional races. The result for the party is unclear, but there appears to be some degree of movement in the conservative base that has been building slowly behind a new name: the GOP."We were looking for a new party that would represent all Americans," said Josh Miller, a 36-year-old Florida college student who marched with about 100 other tea party supporters at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 12, 2009.Two weeks later, Miller was one of a few dozen protesters in Iowa City, Iowa, who met in a parking lot to plan the 2012 campaign for the Iowa State Republican Party. The state party is the birthplace of the Tea Party and a place where the movement has been most prominent.About three hundred people gathered at the Iowa State Capitol on Saturday afternoon, and after speeches from prominent party activists, they decided to formally launch the party, which they refer to as the "conservative Tea Party Caucus." The caucus will be held on Jan. 16 in Des Moines, Iowa.Now, the Tea Party is an influential force in the party, even though it has little national reach and is often described as a third party. The group's goal is to recruit candidates to run in Republican primaries for congressional and state and local offices. The candidates that will run in Iowa have already been selected.As with many movements, the Tea Party movement evolved out of its own internal dynamics."It took on a life of its own when people started getting tired of the two-party system and wanted to believe in a third party," said	0

Africa is poor, corrupt and rural. Right? Think again. A team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of Africa as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent. When filmmaker Nosarieme Garrick hit the streets of New York to ask passersby: "What do you know about Africa?" the overwhelming response was "not a lot." "It's very big, very hot. Most of Africa's impoverished. I'm pretty ignorant to Africa," admitted one man. "I know about some human rights violations, some wars and genocides," was the bleak answer from another woman. It was a dismal reflection of many Western stereotypes surrounding Africa -- one that Nosarieme is determined to change. Watch: Fighting Hollywood stereotypes My Africa is: hopeful The 27-year-old hopes to launch an eight-part documentary series 'My Africa Is' -- showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders. "The four things that come to mind when people think of Africa are population, problems, poverty, and promise unfulfilled -- headline media reports on the continent. But that's not the whole story," Nosarieme, originally from Nigeria and now living in Washington, said. The ambitious project would cover 13 cities across sub-Saharan Africa. Organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the Kickstarter website and hope to start filming in October if they reach their target. "Between the 1980s and now the image of famine and wars has been ingrained in people's minds. That's a narrative that's going to be hard to shift," Nosarieme said. "That's not to discount the fact that this stuff does happen. But what I wasn't seeing was the solutions."

It's a truth of warfare in the digital era: Bullets and bombs often are augmented by status updates and tweets. The bloody conflict taking place in Iraq is no different. And Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, a terror  organization that has declared war on the West, is no exception. The group's online communication system, which is run by thousands of Twitter users, consists largely of a series of tweets and status updates, with more of an emphasis on the latter. What's striking, however, is the content of these messages, which are generally short-but-violent updates on what ISIS has been doing.A look at some of Twitter's most recent updates on the Iraq-Syria conflict reveals that the group is more than just a bunch of words: It has a history.Read on to find out how ISIS' tweets have evolved from an Internet feed into a battle cry.1. IraqMarch 26, 2014: "Iraqi troops now have complete control of al-Alam, with the exception that our allies and tribesmen [in Syria] are [still] trying to hold back the offensive. We are awaiting developments," says one Twitter user who identifies himself simply as "Shawe" and is likely a spokesman for the group. "We have established full authority over al-Alam."March 30: "We have the situation under control in both al-Aflit and al-Alam," says a user named Ammar Al-Shihaie who appears to be a spokesman for ISIS.

The U.S. government shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET Tuesday after lawmakers in the House and the Senate could not agree on a spending bill to fund the government. The two sides bickered and blamed each other for more than a week over ides in the federal spending cap debate. At roughly midnight, the government was still operating, with the ability to perform some of its nonessential functions.Lawmakers in both chambers have been negotiating for hours. House and Senate leaders have been fighting over how to fund the government. There’s been no new news in the government shutdown talk and very little movement. The Senate has a final say on the spending level of the House’s bill, but the two sides just weren’t willing to make a deal.President Obama called for an end to the impasse on Tuesday morning and said he would not sign a bill that was not funded in the next week. The White House said the government would start going into effect Tuesday around 9 a.m. But the government would remain closed over the next few days.The House and Senate have been at odds over how to find the appropriations bill to fund the government. Lawmakers are expected to be at a impasse again Wednesday.Here are all the stories you need to know about the government shutdown.President Obama and House and Senate RepublicansPresident Obama said Tuesday he would not sign any continuing resolution that did not fund government for a full week.

For a pop star with millions of frenzied fans, Taylor Swift does a pretty good job keeping tabs on them. She has a history of stalking -- er, "Tay-lurking" -- fans on social media, figuring out their likes, dislikes and what's going on in their lives. And she loves to shower super loyal ones with some enormous gifts. But the package that Rebekah Bortniker received may be one of the most complicated presents yet. The giant box, labeled "SwiftEx" instead of "FedEx," contained so many meticulously wrapped gifts that it took Bortniker several minutes to open them all. "Hi you. I was thinking about you today, and how you have been there cheering me on in the most thoughtful and creative ways," the singer wrote on a card. "I'm not a good painter but I think you're so beautiful and positive, even though you're dealing with the stress life brings, so I wanted to make you something." Yep, the Grammy winner sent a custom-made floral painting to her fan. She even sent a Polaroid of herself doing so as proof. Then there was a necklace. "Was mine, now yours," Swift explained. Finally, a gift to help ease Bortniker's student loan debt. "Rebekah, now you're $1989 closer to paying off those student loans," Swift wrote. 1989, of course, isn't just Swift's birth year -- it's the name of her latest album and world tour. By this point, Bortniker could barely speak from all the emotion. "I don't even know what to say," she managed to say. Fortunately she has time to think of a response before September -- when she'll be at two of Swift's concerts. Taylor Swift's year-end gift video brings all the feels CNN's Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.	1
Ten years after "The Nanny Diaries" became a bestseller, authors Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus have released back-to-back new books. A lot has changed in the publishing industry, not to mention in the authors' personal lives, between the bookends of their careers thus far. "Over You" is a young adult novel about a teenager who helps friends cope with breakups, while struggling to move on from her own heartbreak. And "Between You and Me" depicts a famous singer's public self-destruction, in a story reminiscent of recent real-life celebrity dramas. It's been a busy decade for McLaughlin and Kraus, both 38. "The Nanny Diaries," their satirical novel about a young woman who looks after the offspring of spoiled Manhattan parents, sold four million copies. It spawned a sequel ("The Nanny Returns") and a feature film. McLaughlin and Kraus also wrote "Citizen Girl," "Dedication," and their young adult debut, "The Real Real," in addition to various short stories. But their prolific writing career isn't their only priority these days. The two former nannies recently became mothers: McLaughlin's son, Theo, and Kraus's daughter, Sophie, are both 2 years old. The authors live in New York City, where I went to high school with Kraus. The new mothers talked to CNN over the phone about their transition from writers, to working moms, who are also adapting to a shift in the literary landscape. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: How has becoming mothers impacted your writing? Kraus: We're definitely more efficient than we've ever been before, because we have to be. We no longer have those sweet spot, post-sugar crash, 5 to 8 p.m. hours to make up whatever we haven't gotten done during the day. We have a hard clock-out because we have to be at pickup. We have to do the parts of the day that we love: dinner, bath time and bedtime. And sometimes we get back to work after our kids go to bed, but we're usually really brain-fried by then, in a way that we didn't used to be.	1
Whether he is predicting the demise of the U.S. "empire," questioning U.S. accounts of the 9/11 attacks or accusing Europe of using the Holocaust as an excuse for supporting Israel, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad knows how to push the West's buttons at  the United Nations.Ahmadinejad was elected in the Iran's second-most populous province with a strong socialist agenda but the Western-backed leader of the Islamic Republic has consistently used his time in the international body to attack Israel and the West.With his fourth visit to the U.N. Security Council in eight months, Ahmadinejad accused the West of using the Holocaust to justify the Zionist regime, which he said "pursues the same path as Hitler's Germany." After the first two meetings of the Security Council under the "P5+1" alliance of Western countries and Iran, Ahmadinejad told reporters Monday that he doesn't have a problem if the U.N. sees the Holocaust as a pretext to condemn Israel or calls on Israel to allow its citizens to flee to Israel to escape its "concentration camps."Ahmadinejad said he had made the remarks in the context of criticizing the United Nations for having opposed his country during its "human rights" case at the International Court of Justice. According to the Iranian leader, the U.N. has only condemned countries that are "using human rights to justify the occupation and the plunder of Palestine," but refuses to acknowledge that the "Holocaust is a justification for the destruction of an entire people."Ahmadinejad said there are "no people who have been killed in the Holocaust. It is a myth that has been created to allow the Zionist regime to take Jewish lives for the sake of 'human rights.'"The Iranian leader added that the Islamic Republic's founding document, the Quran, has never said "to kill Jews or to oppress Christian or to oppress people of other nationalities."“We are also ready to participate to the debate at the U.N., but it is a debate over human rights and not over the Zionist regime’s crimes,” he added to reporters at the Security Council Monday night, referring to the country’s repeated complaints that the U.N. Security Council “has not upheld the rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories.”Ahmadinejad said he was “convinced	0

"The Berenstain Bears'" co-creator Jan Berenstain has died at the age of 88, according to a Facebook page dedicated to the furry characters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an abbreviation for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbarnyard animalsÃ¢â‚¬Â who first became a hit in 1941."Benny" died peacefully at home on Wednesday morning (30.01.14) after a long battle with colon cancer, the page said.He wrote more than 150 books and was renowned for his role as the author of the "Berenstain Bears" series of children's books, which first appeared in the early 1940s.He had been hospitalized for about two weeks earlier in the month after he stopped breathing.Berenstain was known for his often surrealist, word-cracking, cartoon-like drawings, but he also wrote the story for the comic strip "Bearsville".The real life co-creator of the Berenstain family were his mother, Frances, and his father, "Benny" Berenstain, who passed away in 1979.His son Tim also became an author and wrote a book about his father titled "Benny's Barnyard - A True Story of Love, Life, and Family".Berenstain's work, with more than 800 books, has generated many imitators and "Berenstain Bears" became an international hit in the 1950s and 1960s.The fictional characters went on to be seen in popular TV shows like "Sesame Street" and "Sesame & Friends".His son Tim, who passed away in 2004, wrote in his book "A Berenstein Bears Adventure Book": "My father was an excellent scientist and artist, and a brilliant storyteller. He could put the most seemingly unconnected facts of his childhood and life in a meaningful and entertaining way."He was a man who loved and cared for his family and friends, and who gave generously of his time, talents and treasure. My father used his literary gift to give these gifts to others."The Berenstains were very famous for their love of children's books, and in fact ran their own children's book store from 1952 until 1963.Tim B	0
It's 7 a.m. at Henry Ford Hospital, and surgeons are preparing to remove a cancerous tumor from a man's kidney. A doctor posts updates on social-networking site Twitter during a recent operation in Detroit. It's potentially a risky surgery, but everything's ready: The doctors and nurses are in the operating room, the surgical instruments are sterilized and ready to go, and the chief resident is furiously Twittering on his laptop. That's right -- last week, for the second known time, surgeons Twittered a surgery by using social-networking site Twitter to give short real-time updates about the procedure. Following the February 9 operation online were other doctors, medical students and the merely curious.  Watch surgeons Twittering from the operating room » "Here's something different: HenryFordNews is live tweeting surgery today, getting some buzz, too," wrote one Twitter participant from Massachusetts. "I find this fascinating!" tweeted another Twitter user from Swansea, United Kingdom. "It's an interesting use of technology, but I can't help but feel a bit 'eeewww!' about this," wrote a third tweeter from New York. Why twitter a surgery? Whether it's new and cool or merely yicky, observers say there's no question that more and more doctors -- and patients -- will be sharing the blow-by-blow of medical procedures on sites like Twitter and Facebook. Dr. Craig Rogers, the lead surgeon in the Henry Ford surgery, said the impetus for his Twittering was to let people know that a tumor can be removed without taking the entire kidney. "We're trying to use this as a way to get the word out," Rogers said. Observers say Twittering about a procedure is a natural outgrowth of the social networking media revolution. "Doing this removes a real communication barrier. It helps make something scary much more comprehendable," said Christopher Parks, co-founder of the Web site changehealthcare.com. "It brings us closer together and makes us more engaged." Four months ago, Park's colleague, Robert Hendrick, tweeted his own varicose vein removal surgery here as it was happening (he was, obviously, under local anesthesia). "It redirected my attention and allowed me to minimize some of the nervousness around what was going on. It felt like I had family and friends there to support me," Hendrick wrote in an e-mail.	1
It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal. And one of those "firsts" was a "last," as Switzerland netted a winning goal deep into stoppage time, in what is reportedly the latest score in the opening round of the tournament. Here are some of the highlights from Sunday in Brazil: Getting on the board It took almost the entire contest, but Bosnia and Herzegovina made sure its first World Cup match didn't end up a shutout. Vedad Ibisevic brought his homeland to within a goal of Argentina with a score in the 84th minute at Rio De Janeiro's Maracana Stadium, trickling a score past Argentine goaltender Sergio Romero. But it was too little, too late, as Argentina held on for a 2-1 victory. We should mention that Ibisevic wasn't the first Bosnian to put the ball in the net. The problem is Sead Kolasinac knocked it into the wrong net, scoring an own goal just 3 minutes into the game. A hot Messi It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup. Messi scored a sublime goal in the 65th minute, on a give-and-go with Gonzalo Higuain that led to a strong left foot off the inside of the post. The tally led to boos from Argentine-hating Brazilian fans in Maracana, exultation across Argentina and Twitter almost exploding. The Argentine striker won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year crowns in 2009, the combined FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010-2012, and placed second in 2013, while leading FC Barcelona to several major championships. But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals. Now that the pressure to score has abated, could this be the year Messi leads Argentina to the title? As late as it gets In 30 seconds, emotions for Ecuadorians went from exultation to heartbreak.	1
When the Roman Emperor Hadrian came to power in 117AD he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams. A massive bust of Hadrian's head unearthed only last year is part  of this complex problem.The emperor Hadrian was responsible for creating the Great Wall of China, bringing to an end for centuries the age of imperial conquest, but his own empire was equally divided by a vast, semi-autonomous realm under his jurisdiction. In some parts of the empire its citizens were required to make a solemn oath of loyalty, but elsewhere they were free to follow their own inclinations.It is thought that Emperor Hadrian's decision to allow various provinces such as Dacians and Belgic Gauls to flourish under their own laws and customs was based on a similar principle. This policy, the imperial bureaucracy believed, would allow the empire to continue to prosper while respecting local customs and cultures, thus insuring the long-term survival of the empire.For the first two centuries, however, the vast empire was not quite so prosperous and the local customs seemed to be more important in the long run. However, these customs eventually disappeared, and with them ended the imperial rule.The Roman empire, the world's oldest continuous one, was founded in 27BC. By the 1st centuryAD the empire had conquered most of Western Asia and stretched its influence from Britain to north Africa. Rome itself was not a city-state but was, rather, more of a province with its own government.The Roman Empire, as it was later called, was also the first civilization to write down its history and law. It was probably also the first civilization to establish a written constitution.But the empire did not last so long. The population of the empire fell dramatically, and the Roman empire died after a mere three centuries in A.D.There were many theories proposed as to the exact reasons for the decline of Rome, but in recent decades historians have been becoming increasingly reluctant to attribute Rome's demise to their theories.What we do know is that the Romans did not leave behind a written constitution as we tend to assume they did. They did not develop a constitution to be used after they ceased to rule the empire, but instead left the constitution in the imperial treasury at Rome.The Roman emperor was not a dictator, but a king. Like the king of England, he was not	0
Ralph Nader floated the idea this week that a primary challenge to President Obama will help the president and the country. He is flat-out wrong. His views are based on a faulty premise and a myth. We will start with the faulty premise and get to  the myth in a moment. But first let’s get the idea of challenging Obama out of the way.Nader: People are angry and frustrated enough without having to get involved in a primary. I’m not convinced that any serious candidate that has a real chance would challenge Obama at this point in time.Here is a short primer on the primary system: It’s a political game show where the last two or three candidates, on a single ticket, can run against the president during the general election. They compete on the idea of who can do the best job of winning the White House. For example, George W. Bush ran against all-time political favorite Bill Clinton in the 1996 campaign because Bush wanted to win. Clinton was able to out-debate him in fundraising and, ironically, on the campaign trail.In contrast the Democrats can’t vote against each other in a general election. That makes running against the president a difficult prospect for any candidate. It also makes for a very hard ticket. This is why Democrats choose not to run against each other. They avoid the danger of the opposition party winning over independents and getting their vote out, thus weakening the president.Obama can win a general election. The Republicans can’t. The president’s margin is bigger. The Republicans can run against him. The Democratic challenger can’t. Obama has to beat Romney. It’s a very difficult task.If Obama were to run a primary challenge against Mitt Romney and lose, it would be an embarrassing defeat for the president. He would likely be driven from office and, given that the voters are angry and frustrated enough, it hardly seems likely that he would be re-elected.Obama is going to win in November when the Electoral College votes. His margin is bigger. With the Electoral College, Obama still has to win a number of states. He needs to win more than he needs to win the popular vote.So, why wouldn’t a primary challenge by a serious Democrat against Obama work? Well, he doesn’t think it would work. Of course it wouldn	0
The video of Mitt Romney deriding the 47% of Americans "who are dependent upon government" re-ignited a debate about social class in America this week, exactly one year after the Occupy Wall Street movement first took to the streets to protest rising inequality. At a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser, Romney scoffed at that 47% "who pay no income tax" and "believe they are victims." Romney's comments bothered many Americans because he seemed to be attacking some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Aside from whether they actually "believe they are victims," research has consistently shown that people lower on the social totem pole suffer significantly worse mental and physical health than those better off, including higher rates of heart disease, depression, suicide, several forms of cancer and death. Yet a new line of psychological research suggests there's another victim of inequality: the rich themselves. In fact, Romney's comments could make him the poster child for this research. Opinion: It's not all over for Romney In a series of studies, researchers have found that attaining high social status impairs key social and emotional skills. For instance, a 2010 study published in Psychological Science  found  that people of higher socioeconomic status were worse at reading other people's emotions, a skill known as "empathic accuracy," a basic part of empathy. In a follow-up experiment, the researchers -- including Dacher Keltner, my colleague at UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center -- made people feel higher or lower on the social ladder. Regardless of their actual socioeconomic status, people temporarily made to feel upper class had a harder time reading other people's emotions; people made to feel lower class showed better empathy. This suggests that there's something about the experience of high status that hurts our ability to connect with others emotionally. Other studies have suggested that high status makes people less compassionate, less generous and less interested in connecting with others in general . Here's why the people at that $50,000-a-plate dinner should care about this research: The skills that seem to be impaired by elevated status are the same skills that research has strongly linked to leading a happy, meaningful life. So as the super rich in this country assume an ever-loftier status above the 47% (or the 99%), they risk depleting their own reserves of happiness.	1
The illness that derailed Miley Cyrus' U.S. tour in April has returned like a wrecking ball at the start of her European tour. Cyrus'  most recent performance resulted in a stomach complaint after a show in Amsterdam. Three weeks later, a show in Paris resulted in the singer's collapse backstage, with her hair and makeup covered in mud.Cyrus returned to U.S. soil on Friday after the initial show. She appeared to be in good spirits, but that was short-lived. Later in the day, Cyrus was seen on a gurney surrounded by her team of doctors, who were frantically trying to resuscitate her. Cyrus was then taken to a hospital, and it was clear that her health had taken a turn for the worse, as she has been hospitalized for three weeks on a respirator.A representative for Cyrus told People that she was not going to the U.S. for another scheduled performance. The singer will remain in Europe for another month, and is planning a concert in Australia later this year.After the show in Amsterdam, Cyrus appeared in front of her audience wearing the same wig she wore to a show during her 2012 European tour . It's unclear at this point whether Cyrus will ever ditch the wig, which has become a permanent fixture in her wardrobe over the years. Cyrus fans are asking for the return of the original wig, with one fan posting an image of their own worn wig on the social media site Tumblr.Cyrus' medical team is planning to do more tests in preparation for a possible return to the tour later this year. It's unknown at this time if the singer will continue her U.S. tour, or if there will be a delay. In the last week, Cyrus has posted on her Instagram about her upcoming concert in Amsterdam.The last three weeks of the singer's world tour haven't been kind to her. The singer's most recent performance in May at the MTV Europe Awards saw her struggle to perform, with a stomachache after the show that she had previously overcome. The singer was later hospitalized after experiencing symptoms of dehydration and stomach pains.It was later revealed that Cyrus suffered from the same stomach illness that had led her to cancel a show in April in Amsterdam . Prior to her hospitalization, Cyrus tweeted in a now-viral video, "My head, my heart and my stomach are all OK! So it's time for a rest	0
For thousands of years, waves on the largest of the Great Lakes have battered northwest Wisconsin, shaping the dramatic sandstone caves of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. But that punishment halted this winter when iced-over lakes forced it to close for repairs.As ice retreats, the National Park Service and its partners in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore look to the future. The parks and the area will likely face threats such as rising seas and more intense waves in the coming decades. The park service now plans to make upgrades to its lakeshore visitor center, replacing a small building that sits in the middle of one of the islands’ most scenic features.The National Park Service and its partners in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore are working closely with Lake Michigan, its watershed, and the Apostle Islands Natural Society on their long-term plans. A series of reports published last month by the Natural Society details the park service’s work in the areas of water quality, shoreline management, and the management of wildlife. The environmental organizations have made it clear they want to see the lakeshore return to its natural state and support the park service’s efforts to do so.NPS Assistant Director Steve Smith oversees the lakeshore efforts. He says the lake remains one of the best habitats for wildlife in the park.“We’re lucky,” Smith says. “It has a lot of habitat to it, and it’s very fishable.”In addition to the lakes, the lakeshore is home to a variety of unique species of plants and animals that call the park’s waters home. The park service says it is working toward returning the area to a state of nature, as its lakes, rivers, and wetlands were once.“The goal is to restore the wetlands, the wildlife, and the natural diversity of the lakeshore,” Smith says.The most controversial issue at hand is the size of the visitor center. It’s an addition that was built in 1980, when it was the only thing between visitors at the islands. The building originally housed a gift shop, where visitors could book island excursions and buy souvenirs. The shop closed in 2007, leaving Lake Michigan without a visitor education center.“The idea was that the lakeshore visitor center would be for people to	0
A fugitive accused of stealing $2 million from an armored truck he was driving and killing his partner was caught early Tuesday in Â£200,000 ($267,000) cash and a gold nugget worth $10,000 in his pocket, the U.S. Marshals said.Jorge Alberto Gonzalez, 38, was apprehended by deputy marshals near his home near Bakersfield, Calif. on his way to the Central Coast after he made threats against a deputy marshal, authorities said.He apparently was trying to avoid his arrest on unrelated charges, the FBI said.The FBI had said Gonzalez was wanted on charges in the killings of a U.S. Marshals Service official and a federal judge.FBI spokeswoman Angela Powers said authorities believe Gonzalez might be hiding at his home."We know he's inside," Powers said. "He's one of our targets and we want him to come out."It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. marshal who first contacted authorities about Gonzalez was a federal officer or a deputy.A U.S. marshal said he had "no comment" about an FBI announcement he was in custody but acknowledged that he had served as an escort to Gonzalez."I know he was with me. I know he was under arrest," said the marshal to reporters at the Kern County Jail late Tuesday.Later, he said: "He was in custody as soon as we got here."It was not immediately clear how Gonzalez, a Mexican national from Mexico said to be on the run, had made the threatening call to the marshal.The U.S. marshal who tried to arrest Gonzalez said he was traveling north on Interstate 5 when he received a call from Gonzalez' father."At first I tried to get the guy's phone number, but then I talked to him, he said he would give me the phone number," said the marshal, who declined to give his name."He wouldn't give me any information, it was like he had nothing to do with what happened," he said of the father.He said Gonzalez' father said that after "an argument" with another man, Gonzalez threatened to kill him."He said, 'They are going to kill me in the morning because your son is killing me,' " the marshal said	0
The much-discussed trailer for "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" just got a makeover. Soon after the trailer went up late on Friday, YouTuber Bobby Burns got to work on doing his own version using classic superhero footage. Instead of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill facing off, this version wonders what it would be like if comics' classic characters Adam West and Christopher Reeve took their places. CNN spoke to 18-year-old Burns about what motivated him to make his now-viral video. (Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio behind "Batman v. Superman," is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) CNN: When did you start making YouTube videos like this? Burns: At age 11. I work for the Made In Network in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Where did this idea come from? Burns: I'm pretty hyped for "Batman v. Superman." As soon as I saw the trailer, my brain immediately went to the classic "Batman" [TV series] and I thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time. CNN: What were you looking to accomplish? Burns: I wanted to contrast the old with the new. CNN: What kind of reaction have you received? Burns: Within an hour of the trailer going up, I went to work on the edit. Within four hours, my edit was finished and up on the Internet. The reaction has been great! It's awesome to see so many people enjoying what I made. Take a look at the fan trailer below:	1
President Barack Obama will deliver his fourth State of the Union address on Tuesday, marking his seventh address to a joint session of Congress. Here are some highlights from past State of the Union addresses: 2012: Obama calls for lower corporate taxes and incentives to U.S. manufacturers to bring overseas jobs back to the U.S. He challenges Congress to act on comprehensive immigration reform and passage of the DREAM Act. He announces he would open up 75% of potential offshore oil and gas resources. He repeated his longstanding call for the wealthy to pay more in taxes, including a specific proposal for millionaires to have a tax rate of 30%. The speech was attended by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was recovering from a gunshot wound. 2011: Obama calls for unity in his first State of the Union after Democrats lost control of the House in the previous year's midterm elections. Although Rep. Paul Ryan gives the official Republican response, Rep. Michele Bachmann delivers a tea party response. 2010: Obama criticizes the Supreme Court for a recent campaign finance ruling that he said "will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections." Justice Samuel Alito is seen on camera shaking his head at the comment and saying, "Not true." By the numbers: State of the Union 2009: Obama says he aims to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. He focuses on energy, health care and education. In a lighter moment, Obama announces that Vice President Joe Biden would head a "tough, unprecedented oversight effort" over the fiscal stimulus plan, "because nobody messes with Joe." 2008: President George W. Bush uses his final State of the Union address to call for a quick shot in the arm for the economy in "a period of uncertainty" and touts progress in the war in Iraq. The speech is in large part overshadowed by the presidential race, coming just eight days before the Super Tuesday primaries. Democratic presidential hopefuls Obama and Hillary Clinton attend the speech; Republican candidate John McCain does not. Bush's approval rating is in the low 30s.	1
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast that killed 10 people near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar on Friday. A suicide bomber rode a motorbike up to a security checkpoint a third of a mile from the consulate and detonated 22 pounds of explosives attached to his body, police spokesman Mohammad Faisal said. Along with those killed, the strike also injured 31 others, Pakistani military officials said. Violent attacks occur frequently around Peshawar, which is in Pakistan's northwest near the border with Afghanistan and adjacent to Pakistan's tribal region. Among the dead were four men and two women. No one from the consulate was injured in the blast, military officials said. Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan passed along the claim of responsibility to CNN in a phone conversation. A week ago, a car bomb exploded at a nearby camp for internally displaced people, killing 12 and injuring 32 others. The Jalozai camp houses hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country's tribal region. Peshawar is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which is rife with Islamic extremists, including the Pakistani Taliban. It has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants.	1

In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn wants a review of state government practices completed in 100 days. "I think we are sending a message to the people of Illinois that we understand that integrity is No. 1 when it comes to the government of the Land of Lincoln," he said of his executive order. Quinn had set up the commission earlier this year when he was lieutenant governor under Rod Blagojevich, whom lawmakers impeached earlier this month and removed from office Thursday. His executive order "formally establishes the Illinois Reform Commission under the auspices of the governor's office," he said at a news conference. The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site. It says it will release an initial report outlining its findings and recommendations in about 100 days. Quinn said there is "an integrity crisis" in Illinois. "We're going to start to fumigate state government from top to bottom to make sure that it has no corruption," he said. The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Blagojevich from office. A second vote, to prevent him from holding future state office, also passed unanimously.  Watch reaction to Blagojevich ouster » Blagojevich said he was sad and disappointed by the Senate's decision but not surprised. He was arrested on federal corruption charges in December. Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president. After the governor's arrest, the state House voted overwhelmingly to impeach him.	1
Forty years ago London's docklands were an industrial wasteland. The shipping companies had moved to deeper waters, factories were left abandoned and poverty was rife. It's hard to believe that in just a few  weeks' time, the area will be a beacon to millions.The transformation has been brought about by a remarkable group of residents, businesses, students and campaigners.And there are not many more examples of successful social and grassroots actions, like this one, which brought the area back to life. Here are some of the key things that have been done:The regeneration projectIn 1981 the Port of London Authority, which manages the docks and harbours, was ordered to start a major redevelopment project for the docks. The plan was to turn the area into a commercial and residential quarter.But the first phase of the project was delayed by political bickering in City Council and by the Conservative Government who wanted to focus on upgrading the city centre rather than the docks. The Port of London Authority began using the area for car parking and the first residents moved in only with the start of the second phase.But that delay set the precedent for what the Port of London Authority had to do in subsequent phases.A £5m housing development was approved. But the housing had to be built up to a point where it could be converted into a residential area so that social housing could open up. The Port of London Authority also had to pay a staggering £30m towards a development which at one point was being supported with public money.Today, Londoners can see the Port of London Authority, now known as City Hall, on New North Road. The headquarters of Her Majesty’s Customs & Revenue, which has its head office in St James’s Palace, occupy the main office building.The City Hall now manages the port and harbours that are home to more than 40,000 businesses. It also supervises the development and renovation of 1,000,000 sq ft of office and industrial space.The City Hall has also become a flagship for a city that needs major, integrated, social and economic regeneration.The Port of London Authority has also opened up more of the area and introduced a variety of new business models, including the new Docklands Light Railway, the first direct underground passageways connecting Docklands and the City and Canary Wharf, as well as the £2	0

(AP Photo/Paco Alcorta)By The Associated PressMEXICO CITY – A woman who has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years was transferred to a private clinic Tuesday where she is expected to die, ending what has been a lengthy and controversial legal fight.A judge ordered Eluana lorindag to a hospital where she was put under constant monitoring Monday as doctors try to determine how much longer she can be kept alive.The hospital said she will be transferred to a facility where her life will be prolonged.In her last hours, lorindag said she wants her parents to be notified."I don't want to go to heaven," she said. "I will have a lot of pain in my life. I don't want to give my life away."The federal judge said lorindag would receive full care until her death and that she would remain on her death bed."I want to be there with her. I want to be there with her," the judge's order said.The battle over lorindag's life started more than two years ago, when doctors diagnosed her with a rare degenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, while her parents were in Mexico celebrating her 60th birthday.Lorindag fought with extreme courage and dignity. She was able to speak, although she had no teeth and her tongue was missing.One of her few senses was sight, which she used to read books. With her sense of taste, she could distinguish chocolate from bitter almonds.She had used her voice to communicate with her family for years, but she stopped talking about a year ago.Eluana	0
Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International. Fifteen former inmates and prison guards told Amnesty about their daily ills, saying that some were forced to eat dog food and that prisoners routinely underwent electric shocks to the genitals.Former captives have also described forced abortions, amputations and rape, according to the testimonies. A former member of the North Korean military, Hyon Yong Chol, described how his comrades were forced to gang rape one fellow member, while another was "took by force" and "forced to drink a hot poison." A former member of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Song Dong Ho, described how she was "totally raped" and her tongue was cut out. Kim Hak Sook, a former member of the Workers’ Party of Korea, said she was gang raped by other party members.Most former prisoners have not been allowed to leave the country, while those who are released are subjected to further political repression.The testimonies were contained in a report titled "Life Threatening Conditions in North Korean Political Prison Camps," which was submitted to Amnesty on January 30, 2017. The accounts of life at the camps were gathered and translated by the BBC and the Committee to Protect Journalists, and can be read in full below.The testimonies of Kim Song Chol, Yong Chol, Song, Jong Hyon, Kim Song Chol, and Song Yong Ok were made available to Amnesty International by the Korean Central News Agency. They all gave their accounts to the BBC at the end of 2017 but have subsequently been unable to make their statements public due to Kim Jong Un’s orders to close down the public reporting media.The testimonies were read by the BBC following this article being published by the Associated Press. A spokesperson for Amnesty International said:"We were appalled to learn that human rights groups had not been allowed to meet former political prisoners before the accounts in this report were publicly available. It is particularly disturbing that human rights and political prisoners must be subjected to the same restrictions, as one of the only human rights groups allowed access, the BBC, was forced to shut down their public reporting media following its report on the testimonies. Human rights in North Korea are in danger of being ignored, and we urge the government to ensure their safety and the safety of the human rights defenders who gather evidence of human rights	0

Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars. Appellate judges at a U.N. war crimes tribunal in the  Hague, Netherlands, found him guilty of three counts of genocide and 14 counts of war crimes on Thursday. The judges sentenced him to 37 life terms. He could have received much longer prison terms.Karadzic, who is also suspected of involvement in the killings of up to 300,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys between 1992 and 1996, will get a 15-year prison term. In addition, he has lost a civil suit at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), since the judges in that case determined that Karadzic had been neither a co-defendant nor a witness for the tribunal.The ICTY found him guilty of the murder of Bosnia-Herzegovina's first prime minister Hrvoje Kralj. Karadzic's guilt was affirmed by the ICTY tribunal judges, who determined that although he had been the ringleader of the wartime genocidal regime in Bosnia, he had acted for Bosnia's warring factions in order to destroy them economically."Radovan Karadzic is a cruel butcher, a man who has systematically destroyed one ethnic community after another. He is responsible for more deaths per one hundred people killed, more than all other leaders of the war," said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Andrew Young, in announcing the verdict.The judges at the Hague tribunal determined that the genocide committed during the Bosnian war consisted of "systematic, premeditated" killings in Bosnia and Serbia, in which the genocide was "deliberately inflicted on a large scale." This is the second war crimes prosecution in Serbia from the Hague Tribunal, after former Bosnian Croat President Vojislav Seselj was convicted in 2008 over the murder of about 7,000 Bosnian Muslim war prisoners at the Jasenica concentration camp -- the biggest war crime of the former Yugoslavia."I will say to them: When I was first arrested and charged, I did nothing in this case except hope that the verdict would come soon," Karadzic said from the dock. "I was certain that it would be sent to my account at a	0
Lindsay Lohan, whose career has been derailed by drunken driving convictions, probation violations and a shoplifting charge, admitted in an interview with talk show host Jay Leno to "poor decisions in the past" -- but predicted an Oscar is in her future. Lohan, in a "Tonight Show" interview taped Monday and broadcast Tuesday, said she's "willing to do the work that I have to do to follow through with being an actress." She hopes to be back on Leno's show in a few years with an Oscar, Lohan said. "I've made a lot of mistakes and I've recognized that, but I'm in the clear now and I feel like as long as I stay focused then I will be able to, you know, achieve what I want to be able to achieve," Lohan told the NBC show's host. When Leno asked what one thing she would like to change about herself, Lohan said it would be the public perception of her. "I want the public knowledge to be about my work, not about things that I didn't get into this business for, that I've put myself into positions where that was the bigger story than what I was working on," she said. Lohan, 24, said she's been cast to play mobster John "Junior" Gotti's wife in a movie, but a 120-day jail sentence and several months of community service for a probation violation threatens to keep her out of the movie. It starts shooting in October. Lohan's next stop: Skid Row She is also scheduled to go on trial in June for allegedly stealing a gold and diamond necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. If convicted, Lohan could face up to a year in jail. The 13 days she spent in a Los Angeles jail last summer "was an interesting experience and it was definitely a wake-up call," Lohan said. "And I think when it happened, everything happens for a reason. I don't know exactly what will happen." Her latest legal setback came Friday when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled that Lohan violated her probation on two 2007 drunken driving convictions by being arrested for the necklace theft. Lohan said she was "kind of numb" when Sautner sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service. Lohan released from jail after posting bond	1
Bankers get a bad press. If they are not in news studios trying to defend their annual bonus being more than most people earn in a lifetime, they are attempting to brush off the latest multi-million pound fine they received for ripping off the public. Not so in the latest edition of the Global Talk Finance program. Representatives from the banking sector talk enthusiastically about how they've reformed their risky business practices and raised billions to fight against poverty and climate change. They herald the introduction of a "Robin Hood" tax, where speculators pay around a 0.1% tax on their financial transactions, as a "triumph." Ok, so it may not strictly be real life. The news anchor is played by "Walking Dead" star Andrew Lincoln, he quizzes characters played by some of Europe's biggest stars -- Bill Nighy, Clemence Poesy, Javier Camara and Heike Makatsch who says the tax was "a profoundly important moment -- it's been good for business and it's brought billions for jobs in Europe." Yet fiction is not so far away from reality. Eleven European countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain are signed up to a Financial Transaction Tax which could raise up to 30 billion pounds annually and be implemented as early as next year. It is the best chance we have of ensuring those responsible for the crisis pay their fair share to put things right. Unfortunately the UK is refusing to join in, even attempting to block the proposal with a groundless legal challenge in the European Courts of Justice. As Bill Nighy's character demonstrates masterfully as he squirms out of questions over how the money could help stop cuts to public services, it means the UK will also lose out on the benefits. Bill Nighy has been involved with the "Robin Hood" tax campaign since its inception in 2010. He came with us to see first-hand the impact of the financial crisis only a few miles away from its epicenter in the City of London. A food bank in the London borough of Putney, where emergency food parcels are given out to those in the most dire need, had seen numbers increase 50% in a year. There are now over 350 Trussell Trust food banks across the UK, at one point opening at the rate of one a week, as people struggle to make ends meet in a perfect storm of public service cuts and decreasing standards of living.	1
Dolly Parton suffered minor injuries in a traffic crash at a Nashville intersection on Monday, according to the singer and police. "I was in a fender bender this morning, here in Nashville," Parton, 67, said in a Twitter posting. "But I am all good. Just a little tired and sore, resting at home." A Nashville police statement blamed the driver of another vehicle with failing to yield to the SUV in which Parton was riding as a front-seat passenger. Parton and the driver of her Nissan Xterra, 68-year-old Judy Ogle, were taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, the police report said. Parton and Ogle have been close friends since elementary school, according to previous interviews. Diane Lish, 64, of Old Hickory, Tennessee, was taken to another hospital for treatment. Lish was behind the wheel of the Mitsubishi Diamante that crashed into Parton's vehicle, police said. None of the injuries appeared serious, police said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.	1
The National Football League announced Monday it will not overturn the penalty it previously imposed against the New Orleans Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did not  specifically mention Saints head coach Sean Payton and quarterback Drew Brees, but made multiple references to the Saints receiving an official waiver that would allow them to take the NFL's offer to play again.Goodell, in a statement to media, said the penalty would not have affected the outcome of the Super Bowl XLVII title game.The NFL had imposed the penalty in response to a New Orleans civil suit the team filed against the league after the 2014 season."The penalty that was imposed by the (National) Football League in connection with the bounty system is a standard disciplinary action that the NFL does not ordinarily impose and which therefore does not adversely affect the outcome of any NFL game," Goodell wrote in the release.The penalty, a $500,000 fine, came in a settlement with the Saints and related disciplinary matter from December 2014."We are thrilled that this settlement will provide a final resolution to this matter," Saints owner Tom Benson said Tuesday in a statement. He added, "We have always taken such matters seriously and acted accordingly, which is why our legal process was commenced."The league and Saints also have been in discussions on a new collective bargaining agreement, which could be finalized as early as Thursday or Friday.It is expected that Brees will be allowed to retire and participate in the festivities after his record-breaking 5,000th career passing yard and 4,000th career touchdown. Brees spent much of Sunday's game making remarks about the impact of the bounty system on the Saints' 2013 season.Last season, Brees threw for nearly 4,000 yards and 43 touchdowns and led his team to the playoffs. But the Saints' star quarterback was not at his best in the regular season, throwing a season- worst 10 interceptions and completing just 66.3 percent of his passes, and he was inconsistent and ineffective in the playoffs.Payton was also criticized following the defeat of the Saints to the New England Patriots, where he was benched in favor of backup Teddy Bridgewater in a 38-7 decision.The Saints' decision to sign quarterback Drew Stanton is more likely than the $16 million-contract figure Goodell originally projected and it could make sense for Payton to take that one.The Saints	0
Dr. Conrad Murray, personal physician to Michael Jackson, was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the pop star's death last summer. A criminal complaint filed earlier in the day alleged that Murray ix-nayed the pop star's doctors, allowing the singer and his team to "fall into an apparent coma." Murray and the rest of the medical staff allegedly neglected Jackson for nearly 24 hours and failed to call for emergency medical care.The Jackson family's lawyer Brian Panish said that after reviewing all the files and documents filed against him, he's "99.9 percent" confident that Murray will not be charged."I feel very confident going into this trial that the evidence will show a clear and convincing case against Dr. Murray," Panish said in a statement.Panish said while the investigation is ongoing and many details are still being revealed, they don't expect jurors to find Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Instead, the lawyer said his client will likely face lesser charges of involuntary manslaughter or negligent homicide."I think he'll be found not guilty or not guilty of a lesser charge," Panish said.For Michael Jackson's family, the trial has been a long, sometimes emotional process, punctuated by Jackson's death in June 2009.The trial is expected to last seven days, though Panish said he's been told jurors will leave the courtroom before he can finish talking about their evidence.Jackson had a reported $500 million fortune, which he made from his hit-single "Thriller," released in 1988. He had a string of hits, including songs including "Smooth Criminal," "Beat It" and "Man in the Mirror." In 1994, Jackson was charged with sexual assault, battery and assault. His case was eventually thrown out after the singer agreed to a $65 million settlement. He released "What's Going On" as his first solo album, and his comeback song "Beat It" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 charts. He also released "Black or White" and "Diamonds" as co-signals for his career.Jackson's final concert on June 20, 2009 was sold out, though the fan waitinglist was so large that the venue had to turn people away.The trial comes after Jackson's death last July. At the time, his health was not believed to be affected by his ongoing drug and alcohol treatment regimen,	0
Two state senators in California are proposing legislation that would eliminate the "personal beliefs" exemption for parents who don't want their children to be vaccinated. Dr. Richard Pan and Ben Allen's announcement came on the day the state of California  was sued by the anti-vaccine group Choice in an attempt to stop California from mandating vaccinations for children. However the lawsuit was rejected by a California judge.The legislation would amend the state's Vaccination and Immunization Act to make the personal beliefs exemption completely inoperative. The legislation goes beyond just removing those who seek to circumvent the vaccination schedule, as it would not allow that person to circumvent the whole vaccination program."Vaccines are extremely effective, and their safety has been well-established. The personal belief exemption not only fails to help ensure the continued safety and efficacy of vaccines; it also makes the public health issues of vaccination more difficult to address and resolves at the expense of children's health and happiness," said Ben Allen, a Sonoma County supervisor.The bill will be heard on the Senate Health, Human Services, and Community Services Committee next week.(Source: the Sonoma County Independent)Senator Ben Allen was the first to express concern at this policy move."I have fought hard for vaccine-injured children. I have also fought to ensure that anyone who has a medical claim can get medical care, regardless of insurance status," said Allen.If passed, this bill would set a new precedent by making all vaccine exemptions illegal, even those who do not believe vaccines are harmful to society because of a personal belief that they are.The bill could also affect vaccine exemptions in California, as the current law is set up to protect parental medical exemption.In August 2017, California passed its first law regarding vaccine exemptions. The bill will only go into effect if two-thirds of the legislature votes in favor of it before the end of the year.The bill would amend state law to establish that it is unlawful not to vaccinate an unvaccinated child under the Act. This would make it a civil violation of the state law to refuse an unvaccinated child vaccination.State law already allows parents to choose to have their unvaccinated children not vaccinated, but is also used as a tool by vaccine manufacturers to prevent the mandatory vaccination of unvaccinated children, especially those who believe in alternative medicine. The bill would protect these	0
The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months. The question is: Which has he been doing more of lately? The poll was a reminder that Americans tend to be more forgiving of their presidents over time, no matter how long they served, which party they hailed from or how voters may have felt about a commander in chief at the moment he stepped down. Jimmy Carter (54%), George Herbert Walker Bush (59%) and Clinton, who have been out of office between 31 and 11 years, all earned personal approval ratings north of 50%; only George W. Bush, who stepped down three years ago, is below 50%. But even his rating has improved since he returned to private life. Being an ex-president is almost always good for your approval rating. Photos: Secrets of the Presidents Club, from Truman to Obama The CNN poll appears at the moment when Clinton has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage, and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering. Some have read in his comments about Mitt Romney (he called his business record "sterling") a desire to undercut Obama or set the table for a run by his wife, Hillary, in 2016. This analysis gained momentum when Clinton told CNBC that economics demanded that the Bush tax cuts should be extended temporarily. That comment led Clinton to apologize. But the evidence doesn't really support a campaign of sabotage. A simpler explanation for Clinton's capering -- and one that better fits Clinton's record -- is that he is a permanent political consultant. And his "candidate" isn't paying close attention to his advice. Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future. Fighting about who did what in the 1980s, Clinton thinks, is a sure loser. Better to focus on who has the better plan going forward. (Remember the chorus of his campaign song? "Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.") So he has taken his approach to the airwaves.	1
George H.W. Bush turns 90 today (June 12), only the fourth American president to reach that age. He's the last of the World War II presidents, the last American leader to preside over the Cold War, the last of a generation of elected leaders who saw themselves as old-fashioned public servants rather than cutthroat campaigners. Today, there are college graduates who weren't even born when he left office. So the question is, what can 20-somethings learn from an old man like Bush? It starts with what Bush said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as President: "What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure. It's through service that all of us can find both." He certainly has had 90 years of "meaning and adventure" â€” flying as one of the youngest Navy pilots in World War II; serving in Congress during the 1960s; as US liaison to China in the days of Mao; as chair of the Republican Party during Watergate; as head of the CIA after the Church Commission; as Ambassador to the United Nations during the Cold War; as Vice President during the Reagan Revolution; as President during the collapse of the Soviet Union. And as a post-presidential humanitarian, he has raised millions for cancer research and disaster relief alongside the man who was his most bitter political rival. Bush had a front-row seat to most of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, and he did it by dedicating his life to service to others. "Public service is a noble calling," something he's said so often that it's engraved on a bust at his Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. (The students rub its brass nose for good luck; he once quipped, "Thank God it was only a bust!") I asked about Bush's formula for meaning and adventure when I interviewed 41 extraordinary people for our new documentary about our 41st president, "41ON41." Many of the 41 spoke of Bush's lifelong commitment to public service, whether in uniform, in appointed positions, through elected office or in community service.	1
A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a "serial rapist" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Henderson's rape case in January by two different University Title IX Officers. Nungesser was accused of rape at the hands of Henderson a week before she was raped. The lawsuit also accuses the school of "fail[ing] to take any steps to ensure [Nungesser] would not be subjected to future abuse." The New York Times reported that Nungesser's attorney, David Harris, said Nungesser is the first survivor of sexual violence at Columbia who sued the school, while the school said the suit is "without merit." In a statement, the school said the lawsuit "is a politically-motivated attack by a disgruntled former student who has made false allegations in other cases." The Columbia Daily Spectator, a student newspaper, published an op-ed earlier this month titled "Columbia's Rape Case" which included Nungesser's accusation. In the statement, the school wrote: "The claim about having a serial rapist on campus is false". In early January it was reported that the Columbia Board of Trustees voted to fire the woman, charging her with "unbecoming conduct" for "creat[ing] a hostile and intimidating work environment for other students." In late January, NBC reported that the school had settled with Henderson for $250,000.Accused: H. R. McMaster, former National Security Adviser, resigned from President Trump's White House over domestic abuse allegations. On August 3, 2019, H. R. McMaster was reportedly removed from his role as National Security Advisor after it was reported he ignored several requests to speak privately with Trump.The following day the President confirmed that he had asked the former national security adviser for an "impartial investigation" of the allegations, and that he "gave the advice I gave to his predecessor, General McMaster." The President also commented on the affair saying "This was a terrible situation, and he should have been fired immediately upon learning of it. He did nothing wrong, and was eventually vindicated", and added "General McMaster's record of service to our country is second to none." On August 6, Trump issued a statement clarifying McMaster's role in the affair. Citing an	0
After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are piecing together more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, including the suspect's behavior earlier in the week and a warning from his family Ã¢â¬âfor your protection,Ã¢â¬â they said.Krissi Lacey, left, and her mother, Jennifer Lacey, speak about the LAPD's investigation at their home in Pasadena, Calif., Tuesday, June 23, 2018. Lacey was one of two men who were shot and killed during an argument at Los Angeles International Airport Friday morning, authorities said. David Crane / Los Angeles Times via APThe shooting is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department’s Major Case Unit and the Los Angeles County coronerÃ¢â¬âs investigation is ongoing, police said.Krissi’s family said the 24-year-old “was a beautiful, kindhearted and thoughtful young lady, who everyone loved.” She was an artist and a singer, they said.A GoFundMe page for her family has raised more than $37,000 in seven days, with more than $8,200 raised as of noon Monday, the second day of the fundraising campaign.“We are still hopeful that there is justice for Krissi, but we will endure until our Krissi is safe and returned home to us,” the GoFundMe page said.Krissi, who was engaged to marry her fiance, Jason Lacey, said Thursday that she is “extremely frightened and anxious” and is asking people who have information about “who the shooter was or anything to help my family through this.”She said that when she heard gunshots she thought the man who fired the gun was someone she knew, “but it was not someone I knew or had ever met.”Krissi’s mother said she called for help after noticing her daughter’s body lying on the ground near a baggage claim area during a panic response when she was shot about 8:30 a.m.Rudy Guede, her fiancé, was shot in the back and chest and killed during the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’	0
For several months now, Filipinos have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television. Renato Corona, chief justice of the Supreme Court is in the dock, accused of illegally amassing cash and real estate as well as of "partiality and subservience" to the previous president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. In a country where politics has always been about scandal and spectacle, it's showtime once again. In the past weeks, prosecutors at the trial have submitted evidence of posh apartments allegedly purchased by the chief justice as well as substantial amounts in his bank accounts. These, they said, weren't listed on his financial disclosures and their total value far exceed his legitimate earnings. If this sounds like an old script, it's because it is. In 2001, then president Joseph Estrada was impeached -- and later overthrown in a popular uprising -- for much the same reasons. And it all happened on national television. Cheered on by Manila's rambunctious media and chattering classes, coalitions of both reform-minded and opportunistic politicians have since then attempted to restage the triumph by launching impeachment suits against a succession of high officials. These high-profile political dramas capture the public's attention and raise awareness about malfeasance in high places. But are they the best way to fight corruption? Is the "sturm und drang" of political trials the most effective way of cleansing government? The current president, Benigno Aquino III, seems to think so. As a legislator, he had backed Estrada's impeachment and also the failed impeachment of Arroyo, whose family was hounded by accusations of corruption. As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial. He has also supported the impeachment of the anti-corruption ombudsman. Now it's the chief justice's turn. Aquino came to office on an anti-corruption platform. His election slogan was "daang matuwid" -- the straight path -- and his allies believe that powerful officials who obstruct that path must be forced out. In particular, they see the ombudsman and the chief justice, both Arroyo loyalists, as obstacles to the prosecution not only of the former president but of others they want to hold to account.	1
A UK public inquiry into the 2006 death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko opened Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after years of wrangling over what evidence can be heard. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Russian ersatz officials for his death.The inquiry into Litvinenko is looking at whether the former KGB agent made an enemy of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered in 2006 after a meeting in a London cafe with two Russian fugitives.It was originally expected to take four months before the investigation could be concluded because the inquiry faced a series of procedural roadblocks. The inquiry was initially told to conduct a "further" investigation, which meant that the main inquiry could not begin.The inquiry's chairman, Sir Terence Etherton, appointed to the post by Prime Minister David Cameron, said Monday he was not prepared to commit to the inquiry taking longer than expected."I am not prepared to commit to anything," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program. "We think we can do the job in the time that we have agreed. We have certainly got quite a large group of experts who will have to be consulted, which means we can't hurry things up."The House of Lords, which has ultimate oversight over the English legal system, delayed the proceedings by one year but allowed them to begin after the U.K.'s government gave its consent.The prime minister signed approval last week.The inquiry's three-member lead investigator, Dr. Mark Boal, said earlier Monday that the findings would be "disappointing" and that he hopes to find new evidence in the next three to four months."The last time I was here... I have never seen an inquiry that was going to take that long," Boal said.Boal said the inquiry would focus on the circumstances of Litvinenko's death and whether foreign intelligence officials were involved. His team is also investigating how and why Litvinenko was given a radioactive substance that made him so sick on the night of his death.The inquiry was initially planned to include 10 experts examining why Litvinenko was killed. However, the inquiry committee has reduced the number of experts to three, a move that Boal said was based on a "very serious case" they could not answer.The inquiry is expected to conclude in late 2015.	0
That is my question today. Are you involved in your kid's school? If so, how much? As a new mom in the district, I'm being pitched pretty hard by the PTA. And as a chronic joiner/doer/over committer, I'm intrigued. But I'm also wary. Alex has been in school for a week now. On Monday I went to a breakfast put on by the PTA—I mostly went just to check it out (and to avoid my deadline) but I wound up signing up for six or seven committees. Ack! Many of these "committees" are really just one event that you might help with—a Mother's Day plant sale, say—so it's not that crazy. Right? Parenting.com: The sport I'm not sure I'd let my son play A form also came home in Alex's kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom. I remember my mom being the class mom a lot and I loved the security it gave me to know she was so entrenched in the system. She knew the teachers, she knew the other moms, the kids, the school. She was also the CCD teacher, the Girl Scout leader, the carpool driver and pretty much everything else you'd find under the overarching title of Kick-Ass Stay-At-Home-Mom. I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved. And the PTA seems like a no-brainer, right? That said, I worry about taking on more than I can handle. I'm still feeling the after-effects of my all-encompassing (and beyond worth it) LLS campaign and have already signed up to be a big part of that event again this year. (I'm posting this blog from a café in NYC where I'm spending the day at LLS meetings among other things). My work with the organization is hugely important to me. As is my writing career. And my (limited) free time. Parenting.com: Confessions of an inner-city school teacher	1
Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev apologized Saturday for referring to Serena and Venus Williams as the "Williams brothers" during a TV chat show. Tarpischev, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee, made the comments during a TV interview when Williams was called out by a reporter and Williams snapped back in anger.Tarpischev was suspended by the Russian tennis association the day after the interview. But he and Williams, who was in the United States for the Beijing Olympics, have since resolved the incident diplomatically. Tarpischev was to be interviewed by host R-Us TV on September 13, 2008. About an hour before the show was scheduled to begin, Williams was spotted in the lobby of the hotel, where her bodyguards were waiting, according to R-Us. "We've gone ahead with the interview,'' Tarpischev's spokeswoman said.The incident, which came days after Williams was banned for four months from the Moscow Olympics, was reported in the Russian press and highlighted the continuing tension between Russia and the United States.The controversy began when Tarpischev, the chairman of the Russian Tennis Federation and a former world number one, said in a radio interview on September 3 that Williams was "the Williams sisters." He then used the comparison during the interview with R-Us."This is a really funny situation. I hope we can sort it out before the interview, because I made a bad comment, and it won't be the last," Tarpischev said. "I understand that Serena is upset. I understand Serena is angry. And, of course, Venus is also angry, because I've made a bad comment. But we're here to do a good job, too."Russian tennis official's comment that Williams' brother is also a tennis player prompted outrage in the Russian press.Williams, who recently completed a 16-month doping ban, was interviewed by the BBC radio station LBC to promote the launch of her new children's clothing line, 'Avenger,' which contains a line of T-shirts and hoodies. The interview began: "This is a very exciting new venture for Serena Williams and her new clothing range. It's quite hard to believe that the first children's range has been launched, after her five-year doping ban. But that's one of the reasons why I'm not	0
Delta Air Lines is reviewing surveillance video from an incident last week in which a 9-year-old boy boarded a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, apparently alone and without a ticket, a spokeswoman for the airline said Monday. While spokeswoman Leslie Scott applauded the crew of Flight 1651 for their "vigilance" after they alerted authorities to the boy, she sought to reassure travelers that the airline is going through the video as it reviews "our policies and procedures to make sure something like this does not happen again." As of Monday, the boy was still in Las Vegas, where his status will be discussed in court Tuesday, a spokesman for Minnesota's Hennepin County said. Officials in Hennepin County are waiting until "things are resolved out there" before proceeding with the case, Chuck Laszewski said. The child's parents are said to be cooperating fully, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The boy went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Sunday, but officials are still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight Thursday. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said the crew "became suspicious of the child's circumstances" during the flight. Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. A longtime flight attendant told KARE that children who are traveling alone normally get special attention. "It's a big responsibility for the airline as well as the flight attendant," Gregg Proteaux, a longtime flight attendant, told KARE. "You're responsible for them. How do you let 110 people on board when you only have 109 boarding passes?" The boy spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE reported. He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials. He passed his time by taking luggage from a carousel, bringing it to an airport restaurant. CNN affiliate WCCO reported he ordered chicken fingers and a soda, then left without paying, asking a server to watch the bag while he went to the restroom. The following morning the child took a light-rail train to the airport, cleared security and made it to Las Vegas nearly without detection. A flight security expert said the incident highlights the gaps in security, especially when it comes to children.	1
Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as "an intellectual 'Rocky' " -- in the words of "Frost/Nixon" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree  to talk (at a lunch in New York City that he insists on holding at the Waldorf Hotel) about the Nixon tapes . The interview is more than a mere interview, but something different yet, Frost says."We have to go back to that Nixon moment," Frost tells Morgan. It's the moment that Nixon found himself "talking" to the American people in the Watergate hearings -- the moment when he "got out of bed and went and opened up the White House and talked to the people."The interview is more than a simple, two-hour talk, as Morgan says at the outset. It's an opportunity for Frost to "sit down and have a conversation with you, about the past and the present, and the future."As the talk proceeds, Frost finds himself in a conversation that is about the current state of our democracy."One of the things I think that's interesting about the modern American presidency is the way people are held to account," Frost says, noting that Nixon is not only held to account but also held to account by the press, by political opposition, by his own party, by people in power who don't like him, by judges, and by so many others in the American political system.Morgan, author of "Frost/Nixon," is happy to see the "polarization" in presidential discourse that led to the current "post-truth" political climate."There's almost no truth," Frost says. "For the most part, the truth is either the one side, the other side, or you can't be bothered to find one side or the other." (It's this last point that is made by Frost in the Watergate interview, when the longtime Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox says he couldn't "be bothered" to find the other side in the hearings, which had gone on for months.)"If you live in a free democracy, and you're not a liberal or a conservative or a Democrat or Republican -- you're a citizen -- you take whatever you want to take from the various forms of truth and you take whatever you want from the various forms of truth," Frost tells Morgan, "and then	0
World outrage grew Saturday as details emerged about an attack in the Syrian village of Houla, which left more than 90 people dead, including nearly three dozen children, according to the United Nations. U.N. observers went to Houla and  also documented another atrocity, which included execution-style murders of at least 100 men, women and children.The Syrian government blamed the attacks on the armed forces of the Syrian rebels — a position rejected by the U.S., Britain and France, who said the attacks were the result of government troops firing indiscriminately into residential areas.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the victims were shot at close quarters in an area “littered with bullets,” and that there were “a number of reports of women being executed.”The United States issued a strongly worded statement, saying the “horrific massacre” must be condemned — and a strong U.S. military response is required. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met in Geneva to plan a “coordinated, global response” to the attacks, according to Panetta’s office.We begin with the attack in Houla, also known as Qusayr, near the Lebanon border and a site of significant fighting between the Assad government and the Free Syrian Army. (For more details, see our story "Syria's Army Says It Fights Back Against Rebel Militias in the South" here and our article "The Armed Forces of Syria Are Being Slaughtered Like Cats" here.)Here are some key facts about the attack:The attack began shortly after midnight on Friday with a rocket attack on a security checkpoint in Houla. The Syrian government responded with artillery and heavy weapons fire.In retaliation, rebels moved against the government forces in other locations, eventually capturing Houla. Rebels seized control and made their first, if not only, attempt to capture the nearby government base, which killed dozens of members of the security forces.At dawn on Saturday, rebels and the military began to fire at each other. As the fighting intensified, rebels began attacking the Al-Tawheed military base east of Houla, which had come under rebel control.In that fighting, rebels killed over 100 members of the security force. The government responded with artillery and mortar fire.	0
The state visit of the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins to Britain this week is the culmination of a series of contacts at head of state level over 21 years, the most important of which was the successful State visit by  President Pat O'Brien in 1989. This was followed by the visit of the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and his wife, who were joined by the President of the European Council, Romano Prodi, and his wife, in September 1990. Ahern and Prodi are both Catholic but unlike O'Brien, they are not practising members of the Catholic church. Both Ahern and Prodi were accompanied on the state visit to Britain by their wives.The visits of Ahern and Prodi had a very distinct emphasis on the need to move towards closer economic cooperation and on the recognition that Northern Ireland had a role to play in this development. Ahern said that it was the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who had encouraged him to give Northern Ireland a good economic deal. The Taoiseach was not overly impressed with Margaret Thatcher's record on trade and investment in Ireland and found the visit of the Prime Minister to be 'intolerable'. Prodi was more complimentary than either Ahern or his wife and remarked that he had visited Northern Ireland seven times before without getting anything out of it.There was little, as far as direct political dialogue was concerned, between An Taoiseach and President Higgins since it was only in October that President Higgins had had two lengthy conversations with President Ahern, one of which he described to President Higgins as the 'hearty and warm' conversation he had experienced with his counterpart over the previous three years. This was not the first such meeting and there had already been private chats which had been followed by a formal meeting in 1986 and a meeting with President Ahern in 1989. This meeting led to a series of private visits during the last 12 months. President Higgins believed that a 'conversation' was possible with President Higgins and that was what he wanted to see. President Ahern believed that 'personal conversations' were not a good basis for progress but that progress had been made by an invitation to Pope John Paul II to visit Ireland and that that had provided the basis for a private meeting between An Taoiseach and President Higgins. President Higgins believed this meeting was very important in the development of their relationship. It was an important development but not so important as it might have appeared, for it	0
In an attack orchestrated by a Pakistani Taliban commander, around 250 prisoners, most of them militants, were freed this week at the central prison in Dera Ismail Khan in northwestern Pakistan. The commander, Adnan Rashid, had been freed a year earlier, this time at the central jail in Bannu, where 150 Taliban fighters stormed the facility and released nearly 400 prisoners -- Pakistan's largest jailbreak. Both prison breaks happened in the stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders North and South Waziristan, and both were conducted with a high degree of sophistication. This week's attack unfolded in multiple stages, beginning with cutting the prison's electricity, detonating bombs that had been planted around the facility to breach its external wall, and ambushing the security forces that rushed to the scene. Once the militants overwhelmed the guards, they used loudspeakers to contact and locate specific prisoners, freeing them from their cells with hand grenades. At least 13 people died in the attack. Pakistani authorities launched a search operation for the missing prisoners, but few have been recaptured. The others have simply melted away into the mountains. Jihadist militants have been breaking people out of prison across the Middle East and South Asia for years, some with significant consequences for the United States and its allies. Militant group claims responsibility for Iraq prison attacks A 2006 prison break in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of al Qaeda's most virulent affiliates, the one that recruited the "underwear bomber" who nearly brought down Northwest Airlines Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. During the 2006 prison break, 23 inmates escaped through a 460-foot tunnel into a nearby mosque. Two of the escapees went on to become the leader and deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In 2008 and again in 2011, the Afghan Taliban led attacks on the Sarposa prison in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan that freed an astounding number of militants, around 1,700. Like the prison attacks by the Taliban in Pakistan, the Kandahar plots showed sophisticated planning. In the aftermath of the 2011 breach, Afghan officials discovered an intricate network of tunnels under the jail, equipped with electrical and ventilation systems.	1
Sooner or later, James Richter knows the rabbit-ear antennas on his old-fashioned television will listen for a signal and hear nothing. Old TV sets at a California recycling center last month. Many analog TV owners aren't ready to  let go of the old analog signals they were used to. They're on the internet. They're being hacked with some sort of USB cable and a computer. They're being replaced by digital signals from satellites, from terrestrial repeaters, and by new antennas such as the ones on the Internet.At the same time, satellite dishes in California are going digital. One California company is doing just that with a new $8,500 satellite dish that comes with an antenna, a "multiport" cable for the satellite signal to travel through, a power supply, and power for the transmitter. The multiport cable has three ports for satellite, internet, and power. The signal is transmitted from the satellites aboard the Deep Space Network satellites (DSNs), as they're called. Some of the DSNs are in geostationary orbit around the globe, but the ones in geostationary orbit above the equator are called polar orbit satellites, and the DSNs are positioned at an elevation of 23 degrees above the horizontal.Satellite Internet, which uses the DSNs, is moving beyond the Pacific to take over much of the nation. The state of California has joined in, and that has made a lot of people nostalgic for an analog TV signal. The state provides two different DSN satellite programs. The service that provides Internet service to all homes is called Aireon, and the service to serve only homes on the west coast is called WestCoast, both of which are run by the University of California. The Aireon program includes an Internet modem for $20 to $65 for one modem, as well as the satellite signal.The WestCoast program provides only the signal. The price is $7 a month for 20 channels, and service is billed monthly. The WestCoast signal is much more powerful, with more than 1,000 channels to choose from, as well as the ability to add an HD channel in the future. The WestCoast program has been in operation for three and a half years, and this summer, the University of California is launching a trial program that provides HD service.Aireon was the first company to offer satellite service in	0
As Mitt Romney prepares to make the case for a first term, give a thought to what we can expect from a Barack Obama second term. It's probably going to look a lot like the second terms of _________ President.Let's take a look.The country is going to be led by a first term president who in many respects resembles President Reagan and, on the whole, resembles the nation that we've come to know over the past four and five years. The economy is going to be growing but at a slower pace. Unemployment is going to be up, but at a steady, if slower, pace. Health care costs are going to be rising, but they'll be contained. There's going to be a dramatic increase in the national debt, but it won't be out of control.But those things will be happening along with other things, like the "fiscal cliff," a number of which could be avoided with a strong second term leadership from President Obama, especially if there really is a huge fiscal crisis looming. And then there's all those little things that we've only begun to understand: how taxes will be structured and how spending decisions will be made as the country faces the inevitable pressure to raise taxes and to cut spending. Oh, and then there's the president's own domestic and foreign policy record.These things will be more than enough to make Romney, and the rest of the nation, wonder whether it's really better to have Mitt Romney leading the country (and, for that matter, the Republican party) or Barack Obama. And that's true even if Obama's second term is filled with "lessons learned," as Romney likes to say.So what about the president? Is he a leader or a manager? Is he really a "big-tent" type president or a leader who's actually a "bipartisan" president? This is a question that Obama's supporters, and probably many of his critics, have been asking this election year, and it's a question that Romney would probably like to answer, too (since he's not yet a registered Republican). We'll see, but it's probably going to take a lot more than 2012 to sort that question out.But let's start with the one thing we can say about a president who could run for a second term: we're going to be looking at a first term president, all right, but a president who would have	0
Two United Arab Emirates based companies announced on Tuesday that they will be investing in the Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan. Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, called the project "a significant contribution to the ills of Iraq."Baghdad-based oil company Tariq Group and the government of the Arab state of Qatari emir Sheikh Khaled bin al-Thani announced an agreement to invest more than $1 billion in energy projects in the Kurdistan region.The investment is part of a $7 billion investment plan announced in 2014 with the Qatari government committing an additional $3 billion. The projects include the construction of 1,200 kilometres (843 miles) of roads, the expansion of energy infrastructure, and the construction of an airport.In addition, the government and the company announced agreements to expand an oil pipeline to Qatari ports.The project is set to be implemented in five phases. The first phase will include the construction of a $3 billion power plant that will supply electricity to the region (including the autonomous Kurdistan region).The second phase will be the construction of an oil and gas pipeline that will transport crude oil to port in Qatar. The pipeline will bring the crude oil to Saudi Arabia where it is refined and exported to the global market.The third phase will be the construction of a $1 billion power plant at Kirkuk. Power generated in the project will provide power to 1 million people in the region, making it one of the largest power plants in the Middle East.The fourth phase will be the construction of the Shatt al-Arab airport which will serve as the hub of all of the country's airports. With a capacity of 150,000 passengers per year, the Shatt al-Arab airport will become the region's hub for commercial flights, and will act as an alternative to Dubai for passengers and cargo.The fifth phase will include the expansion of the existing Kirkuk oil pipeline to a diameter of 12 metres, and the construction of a second pipeline that will transport oil to Qatar's ports of Doha and Hamad. In September, the government awarded a contract to build a second pipeline to the French company Atalanta, which will work on the project. As of 2014, there are plans to construct two pipelines - one from the Kirkuk oil fields to the port of Doha, and another to the port of Hamad	0
A city official married the first couple in New York City to wed under the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage Sunday. Phyllis Siegal, 76, and Connie Kopelov, 84, were married in a chapel at the city clerk's office as a  second ceremony at an outbuilding was canceled. Siegal, a retired schoolteacher from the Bronx, and Kopelov, a retired police officer from Brooklyn, have been together 29 years.An Associated Press wire report stated the ceremony was carried out by  City Clerk Maggie Asch.City Clerk Maggie Asch administered the marriage license at the New York Municipal Building."The couple came all the way from the borough of Brooklyn to have their wedding and this is a wonderful thing for their families and for their community," Asch said.City Clerk Maggie Asch administered the marriage license at the New York Municipal Building.

First there was friendship. Then there was romance. After that there was marriage. And now, at what would have been a few weeks from her senior year in college, Christian Minard finds herself expelled from  her home, friends in mourning, and a university career half-written.Her life’s story has been told hundreds of times in countless academic and literary anthologies. Yet Minard doesn’t want it retold – for years, she has been trying to forget what happened on an unseasonably warm May afternoon of 2012, and she has been trying to be herself. At some point during her suspension, she started writing.She doesn’t know why, but she has always loved to write. She wrote long letters as a child, making her mother sign them and return them to her, but as a teen, she never kept them. She hasn’t submitted anything to a journal or story competition since she was eighteen, and hasn’t had much free time since then.She has been writing, however, when she is forced to, and she has been writing for her parents. She writes the letters and emails they send to one another, the notes about the daily schedule, and the updates on school work, or about a new haircut or a new nail color she got for herself. She has written about the death of a friend, and about the breakups that have affected the friendship, and the heartache they caused. She has even written about herself.Most of all, it is written when it is not a choice – when she gets into the car, drives to the gym and works out, and writes while there. She writes in her head, and on her heart, and in her car, and maybe she writes in her car on the way home and in her house, but she always writes.***Minard’s mother, Anna, is a small woman, but strong. She works at the college, and is a single mother raising three children – two daughters, one son, and Christian. She wants her daughter to succeed – as she has done at her own college, and as she did at her father’s, where she was the daughter of the late, revered professor and author John Minard.And when Anna tells her daughter how proud she is of her accomplishments, including the two-year stint on the women’	0
Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier died of a heart attack in Port-au-Prince at the age of 63, a family member told CNN Saturday. Known by his nickname "Baby Doc," the so-called "President for life" actually fled Haiti in 1986 and stunned Haiti when he returned 25 years later. He was charged with human rights crimes within days of his return, but he successfully argued in court that the statute of limitations had expired on charges that included torture, rape and extrajudicial killings. Human rights groups decried the court ruling that spared Duvalier. In February, a Haitian appeals court ruled that the lower court was wrong and that there is no statute of limitations for human rights violations. The ruling reopened the possibility that Duvalier could face such charges, but he died before a judicial investigation decided whether to pursue the charges. Duvalier inherited the title of "President for life" in 1971 upon the death of his father, Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, who had ruled with an iron fist through his paramilitary force, the Tonton Macoute. Just 19 years old when he came to power, Baby Doc became one of the world's youngest heads of state. Haitians initially celebrated his ascension, thinking the young man would be less oppressive than his father, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Duvalier used his father's security apparatus to continue ruling in a totalitarian fashion. Fast facts on Duvalier His 15 years of rule were a time of repression in Haiti that included the torture of opponents and the taking of political prisoners. In addition, there were allegations that "Baby Doc" embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International had documented what they call systematic human rights violations under Duvalier's rule. Both organizations accuse Duvalier of imprisoning and torturing hundreds of Haitians, including journalists, and using violent means to silence voices of opposition. 2012: Human rights groups denounce Duvalier decision Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations. Amnesty International's documents told the experiences of cobblers, taxi drivers, filmmakers, mechanics, distillers and even hairdressers, all of whom, they say, were arrested for anti-government activity. Notable deaths in 2014 CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Moni Basu contributed to this report.	1
From the results of the Pwn2Own hacking competition, it looks like Android and Windows Phone 7 are tough nuts to crack. It took only two days for hackers to crack into the Apple and Blackberry operating systems during the three-day Pwn2Own tournament last week, while Android and Windows Phone 7 models were abandoned and left unhacked by the end of the contest. Is this because their operating systems are more secure? Yes and no. "The survival of a target at Pwn2Own does not automatically declare it safer than a target that went down," last year's Internet Explorer Pwn2Own winner Peter Vreugdenhil cautions. The contestants who were lined up to beat the Android and WP7 devices in the competition withdrew for a variety of reasons. Pwn2Own, now in its fifth year, is a hacking competition divided into two areas: web browsers and mobile phones. This year, Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, Apple Safari 5.0.3, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome were the web-browser targets. In the mobile phone category, the Dell Venue Pro (Windows Phone 7), Apple iPhone 4 (iOS), BlackBerry Torch 9800 (Blackberry 6) and Nexus S (Android) were targeted. The OS and browser versions were frozen last week (so for example, Apple's Safari 5.0.4 update was not used), ensuring that all contestants are working on the same version of each OS. Pwning and owning occurs if the hacker defeats the frozen version. If the exploit they used still exists in the current firmware, they are also eligible to receive a monetary prize. The 2011 Pwn2Own competition ran March 9 to 11. Vreugdenhil says many different factors determine how hard a target is to hack. There's the safety of the software itself, the exploit mitigations that are already in place for that software, and then the amount of research that has already been conducted (which can speed up the process of writing an actual exploit). Firefox and Chrome web browsers were also left undefeated because contestants withdrew from Pwn2Own. "Chrome has the advantages of having multiple exploit-mitigation techniques that certainly make it more difficult to hack. As for Android, we see no particular reason why Android would be harder to hack than one of the other targets."	1
Inside a half-empty lecture hall at the American University of Beirut, Maryam Alkhawaja explains her cause. "The thing about Bahrain is that nobody really knows what's going on there because there's not much media coverage,"  she says. "In Lebanon, we're the most open, transparent country in the Middle East because there are cameras everywhere. The media here are actually free to cover any issue they want because we are a democracy."Alkhawaja, a journalism professor and the new director of the Beirut-based Center for Journalism and Media Ethics, believes that many Western journalists - despite a growing global backlash against their coverage - do not understand the "complex, messy and conflict laden" context of Bahrain. "Some of them even defend the regime despite the human rights violations," she says.Alkhawaja's comments - and her choice of language - are unusual for a Middle East newsroom where journalists have been banned by the government in the past and have been forced to leave their bureau or country for being critical of the rulers. "There are other journalists who have disappeared like Amal Clooney - who was accused of trying to assassinate Sheikh Mubarak [the former ruler of Bahrain] - who is also called the 'Citizen of the World' by the media, but is now a prisoner in Bahrain," says Alkhawaja.A leading voice in the Bahraini anti-war movement, Alkhawaja, a Beirut-born and -educated Saudi Arabian, has been an outspoken foreign fighter since the early 1980s, working on stories that she feared were censored by authorities. Her reporting in 1979 on a group of Bahraini women fleeing from the country after a massacre triggered mass protests that led to the overthrow of King Khalid bin Abdel Aziz in a 1991 coup."I was in prison for eight months," she says, "and even though I was sentenced to 15 years in prison, there were no protests or demonstrations against me," she recalls. "I stayed in jail for two years and after that, I left for Beirut and began writing to the newspapers, calling them all to protest the censorship of my stories."Alkhawaja first published her stories on the front lines of the Bahraini uprising on the pro-democracy newspaper, al-Watan. In 1990, the paper's editor, who had worked with her in the 1980s, offered to print her story about the women's massacre	0
Rick Santorum evoked the homespun values of hard work, education and family in his speech to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night, but his math needs improvement. The former Pennsylvania senator and runner-up in this year's GOP urn earned a whopping $4.5 million from the speaking fees for four speeches that collectively brought in $26 million."You can’t tell me that someone who is willing to sacrifice his or her entire adult life and financial future to make something truly great doesn’t deserve to be recognized for their achievement," said Santorum, his eyes fixed on his wife, in his speech to the convention, which was held at the Tampa Bay Times Center.Santorum, who has held up his convention speech as evidence of his conservative bona fides, also highlighted his family values, a fact he has tried to avoid during his failed presidential campaigns.

All told, the speeches that made up the "Santorum SuperPAC" took in more than $4.5 million, according to a report released Wednesday by the Center for Responsive Politics.Those speeches were paid for with money from a variety of sources, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the Koch Brothers. The two largest donors, the Chamber of Commerce and the Koch Brothers, each gave about $2 million to the superPAC. Other large donors to the superPAC include the New York City Opera and the Florida Orchestra. The superPAC also benefited from the generosity of other superPACs, which were able to donate more money because they were already on the list of approved donors that had to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.That leaves the $3.5 million the superPAC took in from the other speeches to make up the $4.5 million in donations it has received. To this point, the superPAC has received more than $100,000 from each speaker to which it was affiliated. The top five donors to the superPAC are:	0
Reports of at least 150 Muslims killed in recent religious clashes in Nigeria should be investigated, a human rights group urged Saturday. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that armed men attacked Kuru Karama in central Nigeria on Tuesday, "killing ____." __________________________________________________Some observers claim police are simply using "unmarked cars" at the border after the latest wave of terrorist attacks. A UN official says police have failed to stop the attacks and have no interest in doing so.The Muslim Ummah (community) says the police have failed them and is now seeking help from the United Nations.From AP:In this file photo, Muslim Ummah (community) members carry away the bodies of their dead at the site of a bomb blast in Kuru-Kuru village, around 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the northern city of Potiskum in Borno state, Nigeria, Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2019. The bodies of 50 people killed by suspected Boko Haram attackers were recovered after the bodies of 30 were found and burned, an official close to the violence in Nigeria's northeast region said late Tuesday, Sept. 10.Ummah members were still being hunted for the dead. "A total of 50 were confirmed killed in the bombing, we have confirmed 30 of them," said Umar Usman, who is now the administrator for Kuru Karama in Borno state.Umar Usman, of the Muslim Ummah (community) said the total number of dead who have been confirmed is 54. He said that more than 300 people died in the attack. He says the people who were killed were farmers.But for Usman, the deaths are unacceptable. He told VOA he believes the Boko Haram attackers have now retreated to nearby Cameroon, but are on their way back to attack again, so he has called on the Nigerian authorities to put armed troops on the border to stop them.The government has said that no forces are at the border. Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau has announced he is going on the offensive in Nigeria.A security official from Nigeria's central government, who asked not to be named, said the police are doing everything they can and in the past month, two or three armed robbers have been killed every day by the police. He said "we are making progress but are going backwards in terms of the security situation."	0
He won his first major at Augusta, played several rounds there with the President of the United States and racked up a record 50 consecutive Masters appearances -- but that's not what leaps to Arnold Palmer's mind when he reflects on the Georgia course. He points instead to the way in which the Masters -- the only one of golf's four major tournaments to take place at the same course every year -- has spread the gospel of golf across Palmer's home nation. "I think the Masters is something that has brought golf to the American people in a way that no other course and no other golf course could do," the 84-year-old told CNN. "They rally around Augusta, and not just people in the southeastern states. They come from California, Washington, Wisconsin -- everywhere -- and that brings a certain mystique to the surface." "Lloyd Mangrum once said to me: 'You know Arnie, I've won a few golf tournaments in my life but I'd give them all up for one Masters.' " Unlike the late Mangrum, who won the U.S. Open in 1946 but twice finished runner-up at Augusta (where his lowest round of 64 was a tournament record for 46 years), Palmer had no such problems. In 1958, just three years after turning pro, he took possession of the green jacket -- the first of four Masters triumphs, and of seven majors in total. Forty-six years later, Palmer -- then 74 -- received an unforgettable standing ovation as he approached the 18th green for the final competitive time after half a century of contesting the course. Latest scores: Masters leaderboard Like Tiger Woods, who misses his first Masters this week because of back surgery, it is the tournament in which Palmer competed the most -- so what made it so special? "Well, of course, the golf course itself. And the club is such a great place. Everything!" opined one of the sport's all-time greats. "The location, the geography of the club, the way the course rolled, the condition -- it was always in impeccable condition, the greens were always good, the fairways. "The entire golf course was something that was a pleasure to be on and I just thoroughly enjoyed it." The scene of his victories in 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964, Augusta was also where Palmer played plenty of golf with Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. President of 1953-1961.	1
More than 150 soldiers in Bangladesh were sentenced to death Tuesday for murder, rape and arson during a 2009 mutiny. "The convicts will be hanged by the neck until death," ruled Mohammad Akhteruzzaman, a senior judge at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Court, in pronouncing the sentences for the 152 paramilitary border guards. Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed in the mutiny at the headquarters of Bangladesh's border guards in Dhaka in February 2009. Investigators initially brought charges against 850 people, including 23 civilians, but the final judgment was against 846 people.  Four suspects died in custody. The accused troopers were indicted on charges of murder, rape, arson, looting weapons and conspiracy. "We had long been waiting for the verdict and it has cleansed the image of the force stained by the massacre," said Maj. Gen. Aziz Ahmed, who now leads the border guards. Several thousand armed soldiers of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) unit took control of their own headquarters in the capital for two days and massacred scores of people, including officers of the Bangladesh Army who were stationed with the BDR. The civilians in the case include a former lawmaker from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, and an Awami League leader, Torab Ali. State prosecutor Mosharrof Hossain Kazal told CNN that 161 people, including Pintu and Ali, were sentenced to life in prison. A total of 262 people were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three years to 10 years and 271 were acquitted of the charges against them. "We may appeal against those who were acquitted," Kazal said. Shamim Sardar, an attorney for one of those sentenced Tuesday, told reporters justice had not been done and vowed to appeal to a higher court. The mutiny erupted less than two months after the present Awami League government -- led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina --  came to power in January 2009 in a landslide victory. According to the charges, the border guards took up weapons, killed the officers, and held the families of the officers hostage in the staff apartments inside the headquarters compound. The dead also included the then-chief of the border guards, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, and his wife. The soldiers demanded better pay and perks, as well as the withdrawal of all army officers from the forces.	1
Evangeline Lilly is in three of the highest-profile movies of the last few years: the last two "Hobbit" movies (the final one out this week), and next year's Marvel extravaganza "Ant-Man." Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing. The actress, who first gained fame on the hit show "Lost," recently spoke with CNN about "The Hobbit" and her current career and plans. CNN: You're now nearing the end of your journey on "The Hobbit"" with "The Battle of Five Armies." What attracted you to the role of Tauriel? Lilly: 'The Hobbit' was one of my favorite books as a kid. I was extremely honored to be representing Tolkien on the screen, and working with Peter Jackson. Working on that project is what inspired me to start writing [her children's book] "The Squickerwonkers" and get it published. It really got me moving and inspired me to set off and do something with my writing. CNN: Tauriel is an original character created for the movie. What was it like tackling that? Lilly: Tauriel was half as daunting as a character from the book. [With] Tauriel, there was no preconceived idea of who she should be. There was a lot of freedom to really play with it, and be open to my own interpretation of her. The scariest part was accepting the role in the first place -- I had to agree to play a character who would be very likely hated by most of the fans. Once I decided (that) I didn't have to live up to anyone's expectation of her, not knowing who she was. CNN: Since she is not in the book, we don't know what will become of her. Lilly: We left her in a situation where she had betrayed her king, and we weren't sure where her heart was at. We start to realize where her alliances are, and who she cares about. Is it the dwarf or Legolas? And she does more ass-kicking, which she does best. But there's a lot more emotional material for Tauriel in this film, which is good to see. We get to know her better. CNN: What made you decide to make the leap to writing? Lilly: When I finished shooting "The Hobbit," I took two years off to be an author.	1
Long before U2 and Bono blazed their own paths, and decades before the Christian music industry became a half-billion-dollar annual business, a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way. Larry Norman sang about ~~„~~-love~~- in the first half of the 20th century, and in the second half he recorded and put out the albums, including _Sister Ray,_ that would later be known as "Woodstock" and "The Wall." The same album that included "Love is a Many Splendored Thing" would be covered in more than a hundred albums, including Frank Sinatra's "My Way," and that album alone has sold 100 million copies worldwide. More than anything else, Norman's music has become a defining force of modern pop. And at the top of that list is "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."_Sister Ray_ was released in August 1965, just as the counterculture was beginning to take off. The album's opening track, "Hazy Shade of Winter," was the first post-war single by an American folk rock band and the first to top the charts for more than a year. It was written by Norman and his friend and producer Chris Hillman.After a series of well-publicized public appearances and the release of a string of minor hits, like "Hazy Shade of Winter," "Sister Ray" was a major success, debuting at number one on the _Billboard_ charts and selling close to 1 million copies in its first month of release.Norman's first hit in America wasn't "Love is a Many Splendored Thing," a tune about infatuation in the desert. It was "You've Got a Friend in Me," a song about the power of love in the face of hate. The _Billboard_ charts had been filled with songs about love, but Norman's work on "You've Got a Friend in Me" marked a new direction for him, and for rock-and-roll.Norman was singing from a place as real as the place music was going and the songs he was singing had reached the same place. The idea of a happy ending to the song was common in rock and roll, but Norman was doing this with music that was real, that embodied what they were talking about.## _The New York Times_ :The song's "	0
Pink hair, piercings and the name Emily -- Iowa father Paul Plate saw his own teenage daughter as he read about a different Emily's harrowing experience with synthetic marijuana. Plate had already had the conversation about the ersatz weed with his daughter, an avid cannabis user who had tried the drug in the past -- and didn't like it."I realized," he said, "she was struggling and it was a problem that I knew she had to address."Emily, now 18, was the first victim of a synthetic marijuana outbreak that erupted on the West Coast in July 2016. It was quickly followed by 20 others, causing authorities to report the potentially fatal syndrome as the first nationally reported outbreak of the drug to arise from natural sources.Symptoms included unusual and sudden muscle twitching. The drug, often sold as synthetic pot by the name spice in some parts of the United States, had not been approved for medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drug was laced with THC, the compound that produces a high, and was highly addictive, according to authorities.Now, it is making a comeback in the form of a designer drug called Spice, reports CNN affiliate KTRK and other media nationwide.But with Spice, too, there is a twist. The drug is being sold in tiny amounts, often in tiny packs of six or less, to ensure police and law enforcement agencies don’t seize the entire drug.In 2016, authorities in California, Oregon and Washington began to report an epidemic of synthetic marijuana on social media platforms, such as Instagram and Twitter, before the drug's link to serious health problems was fully discovered.The year of the outbreak, some users were using the drug for the first time, and authorities seized more than 100 pounds of the drug in Washington state. That seizure in 2016, and a subsequent one in Washington in 2017, led to the drug's designation as a Schedule 1 drug, the most powerful category of drugs in the United States that are illegal for medical use.But despite the DEA's declaration that it has killed Spice in California, officials in that state say they have a far larger problem."Our strategy is to make arrests," California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra, who is overseeing the state’s crackdown on the drug, told CNN's "New Day." "It's still going strong. So it	0
Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs threatened to hit Palm with patent litigation if the company did not stop poaching valuable employees, according to a newly unsealed court filing (hat tip to Reuters). The document surfaced as part of a iphone-related suit filed in a Delaware court against former Palm co-founder and CEO Scott Forstall.Apple and Palm did not respond to our requests for comment.Apple filed suit in November in Delaware against Forstall, seeking an order to stop his “interference” with Apple’s relationship with Palm. Apple filed a similar suit against former Palm CEO Scott Forstall in April, and for both cases Apple has asked for injunctions to halt Forstall’s alleged “interference” with Apple’s relationships with Palm.The suit over Palm’s poaching practices came as a surprise to Forstall who was forced out of the company in 2010 after accusing co-founder Timothy Cook of not supporting him. Forstall also claimed that Apple was not cooperating with him. But by the time his departure was announced in June, Apple had already responded to Forstall’s accusation by reaching an agreement with him in April.Forstall will join Palm’s board of directors if the board approves his resignation.Apple is being represented by its current general counsel Bruce Sewall, who has been helping with the suit. Sewall says he didn’t realize Steve Jobs was the only one mentioned in the document, that Forstall’s legal threat is being brought by some other parties and that the document is just one of many documents filed in the case.Steve Jobs threatened to hit Palm with patent litigation if the company did not stop poaching valuable employeesApple’s suit is seeking an injunction against Scott Forstall’s alleged interference with the transfer of intellectual property (patents and copyrights) to Palm.In it, Apple claims that Forstall has interfered for the past five years, through his employment at Palm, with Apple’s relationships with Palm. Apple is asking the court to bar him from “interfering” with Apple’s contracts with Palm.To be fair, in April of this year, when Apple was responding to Forstall’s ‘interference’ with Apple’s relationship with Palm, a “rebuttal” was filed with many	0
The 54 men and 14 boys rescued after being found chained this week at an Islamic religious school in Pakistan have been reunited with their families or placed in ids with relatives, the UK Foreign Office has said.“We can confirm that all of those who were rescued are now being reunited with their families and that there are concerns over a further case,” a Foreign Office spokesman said. “We’re following this and will be in touch with police.”The three-week lockdown imposed after the discovery of the school in the town of Dera Shahi Khan in Karachi, which has been the scene of several fatal attacks, was lifted on Friday afternoon.The FCO said it was “aware of some reports that some families may be unable to visit” the men and the boys, but added that “this issue has now passed”.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, also visited the school to meet relatives of some of the boys and to reassure them that they would be going home soon.One of the boys who was rescued, 14-year-old Mohammed Shami, was given a hero’s welcome on Friday in Karachi and will return to school after a three-week delay.“This is a very, very important story because it’s the first time we have any idea of how many people are at risk at this school. I thought it was three boys and three or four women and that’s it. Now we know there’s a total of 54 people,” Shami said in an interview with the BBC’s World at One programme.A total of 54 people are believed to have been trapped at the school in one place for three weeks during a lockdown imposed in response to two recent attacks on religious minorities.The BBC understands that police have detained seven men who police believe were involved in the attacks. Police said they will question them about the attack which killed 20 people and injured scores more.There have also been suggestions that the gunmen were connected with the Islamic State group, which controls parts of north-eastern Iraq and Syria.The BBC understands that Pakistani security forces are being given assistance to help deal with the problem including search and rescue teams and a helicopter.On Thursday, the school was being run	0
If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page. For starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor. Â But how about Superman's other big-screen adventures? Are they any good?With a lot of help from a panel from last week and this week's DC Comics news, here are some of Super's best adventures.Â From super villains to super heroes and space to space.1. Superman's first space adventure (and his first fight outside of the Earth)Superman #30 (1948)Superman's first trip into outer space was pretty short but memorable. He fought a flying saucer on the planet Krypton, then he battled a space ship called the Fortress of Solitude.Â And he lost.2.

Cyprus is known for its sunshine, its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese, but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world. Commandaria is a dessert wine with a ursine-like taste, but one that is far more than just a sweet dessert wine. There have been theories about its origins going back to Roman antiquity, but there is now a clear consensus among wine historians that it was born in the time of Diocletian (AD 284-305); and for good reason: the emperor loved it, and there is a large population in eastern Turkey whose roots are in the region. There has been more than one attempt to clone or improve this wine since its creation, but it remains very very good.The history of the wine: the origin storyCommandaria is based on the Roman concept of a non-perishable, nourishing dessert wine. This is what the emperor Diocletian (AD 284-305) liked in his wine, which he referred to as "sacramenta." The wine of this name was often served as a sweet dessert wines during the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean, and it was known as the "sweet wine of the empire."Diocletian would often choose to drink this wine during the day, as he never was a light drinker, and as it was a non-perishable dessert wine, it could be stored in ice packs. In a letter to a young follower that he wrote while in exile (at Vindolanda) in Gaul, Diocletian described the wine he wanted to drink: "On this occasion it is my wish to drink this sacramental wine to please my companion, who has never drunk water and is very ill. I would prefer that the wine has a strong, sweet taste and is not too full. I hope that this wine will not overpower you, and that you will soon recover. This is what I wish to drink in the night, when it has been stored in cold rooms in case I should be away from you."Diocletian loved this wine, and in a letter to Eudoxius, he noted that he had received a small number of bottles of this wine, which was in an old leather bottle. He did not know who had sent them, but he knew that Diocletian wanted to drink it.	0
Basketball, track and swimming have been staples at the Olympics for decades, drawing thousands of spectators. But solo synchronized swimming or live pigeon shooting? They are among the strangest events that have, at one time or another, taken place at the Games. What to watch for at the Olympics this year Here are the 10 oddest sports that have graced the modern Olympics -- some will feature at London 2012 over the coming weeks, some thankfully will not... SOLO SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING Oxymoron alert! Yes, this sport features one female swimmer synchronizing with herself. The sport made its debut in the Los Angeles Games in 1984, with U.S. swimmer Tracie Ruiz winning the gold medal. Similar to the group event, a swimmer performs a kind of water ballet. A lonely water ballet. Despite the seemingly misleading title, organizers of the sport say the swimmer is actually in sync with the music. Will we see this sport in London? No. But there will be the team synchronized swimming events that most people are familiar with. The solo event was discontinued after 1992. CLUB SWINGING Club Swinging debuted in 1904. The athlete stands erect, holding clubs that resemble bowling pins in each hand. He then twirls and whirls them around. The more complicated the routine, the more points he wins. Historians say the sport was the precursor to rhythmic gymnastic events that use ribbons and hoops. Will we see this sport in London? No. Sadly. Club Swinging was only in the Olympics twice, ending in 1932. TUG-OF-WAR Once a very competitive Olympic sport, tug of war employs teams that struggle and strain to pull a rope past a certain point. Great Britain actually won the most medals in this event, historians say. Will we see this sport in London? Nope. Tug-of-war was an Olympic event until 1920, and was then relegated to the church picnic circuit. LIVE PIGEON SHOOTING The 1900 Olympics in Paris had the great distinction of being the first Games where women competed. It also wore the ignoble badge for this sport, where athletes aimed to bring down as many pigeons as possible. Nearly 300 birds were slain, historians say, leaving a bloody, feathery mess. The winner shot down 21 pigeons. Will we see this sport in London?	1
Sometimes, when you least expect it, the good guys win. Sometimes, the good guy is a woman -- a strong, wise and extraordinarily brave woman, such as Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi, 67, has led her people in a decades'  long struggle to ensure that their future is not determined by the whims of authoritarian governments or, worse, by the greed of neighboring countries. She has been a fearless champion of the Burmese people's struggle for democracy, the rule of law and equal opportunity. Yet, as she has faced down the violence of Burma's military rulers, she has also become a human being, a woman with her own fears. Aung San Suu KyiIt is said that an enemy's first move is to undermine your morale. With the current violence in Burma, a war that has lasted for more than half a century, Aung San Suu Kyi has become the target of some very effective attacks.Perhaps the most devastating of them was when two prominent English women made highly critical comments about her. In one particularly nasty letter, two journalists writing for the London Sunday Times (a leading British newspaper) attacked Suu Kyi with the same kind of accusations and innuendos that have long surrounded her -- accusations of hypocrisy, hypocrisy about women's rights and hypocrisy as a leader with responsibilities to all peoples and nations.The London Times letter, published on June 12, 2009, was sent to two women: Amy Nicholson, a former adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on foreign affairs, and Helen Graham, a British academic.Nicholson, who was first appointed in 2000 by the British Foreign Office and then became a high-profile commentator on world affairs, was the former chief operating officer for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in New York, a US government funding agency. She is a former editor of the international journal Foreign Policy, a former editor of the Times Higher Education supplement on international relations, and a former director of the United Kingdom's International Institute for Strategic Studies. Nicholson wrote a chapter for the book, "The New Global Women," co-authored by Susan George. Nicholson and Graham, who was the first full-time woman appointed to the Board of the Times newspaper, have written a book titled, "The New Realities: What Women Tell Us about the World in 2013," in response to a Times article that had provoked more controversy	0
Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum resigned Thursday as head of the Interior Department's scandal-plagued Minerals Management Service, the department's chief said. Two sources told CNN that Birnbaum had been fired. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is involved in federal oversight of offshore oil drilling. Birnbaum's resignation letter cast her decision to leave as a consequence of a decision to reorganize the agency following April's explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion resulted in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap. "As you move forward with the reorganization of Minerals Management Service, you will be requiring ... new leaders," Birnbaum wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. President Barack Obama said Thursday that he didn't know whether Birnbaum had been fired or chose to resign on her own. Speaking before a House subcommittee, Salazar insisted Birnbaum had resigned "on her own terms and own volition." She "is a strong and very effective person who ... helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do," Salazar said. "She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant." Birnbaum, a former high level staffer on Capitol Hill, became head of the MMS in July 2009. A recently released federal report highlighted what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the agency. Among other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored. In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated. The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.	1
From one-time participant to present-day activist against the illegal sport of animal fighting, Michael Vick came to Capitol Hill Tuesday in support of legislation that would criminalize spectators and others who organize the fighting. While trying to keep young people from taking part, the legislation more broadly hopes to make it easier to prosecute people who finance and arrange the gambling, provide locations for fights to happen and otherwise have knowledge of the activity. Vick, now a star quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, was released from prison in 2009 after serving 20 months of a sentence for a dogfighting conviction. His case involved bankrolling illicit animal fights in the state of Virginia. "I deeply regret my previous involvement in dogfighting, I'm sorry for what I did to the animals," Vick told a news conference. "During my time in prison, I told myself I wanted to be part of the solution, not the problem." He was accompanied by the head of the Humane Society of the United States, Wayne Pacelle, who acknowledged it was initially difficult to consider accepting Vick's offer of help, until he realized Vick could carry some influence. "The biggest growth area for dogfighting was urban-based dogfighting," Pacelle said. "Michael's own story starting as a young boy getting involved in dogfighting I thought was a very powerful testimonial. ... "We both agreed that the best thing he could do was speak to these kids because of the platform that he has as an NFL star and to warn them away from this conduct," Pacelle said. The House bill, introduced last week, would establish federal misdemeanor penalties against convicted spectators, and make it a felony for adults found responsible for spectators who are children. At the Capitol Hill news conference, organizers played some local television news coverage showing illicit cockfights, including the participants and the surrounding scene. Vick told reporters the video took him right to the problem. "To see the young kid walking with the cock, you know, was astonishing," Vick said. "It was taking place in a similar setting of what I've been around before. "This is what our kids are being taught," he said, "and it's inhumane and it's pointless. "That child could be doing so much more with his life, instead of walking around with a cock in his hand, waiting to fight, even if he's not involved, being there, his presence speaks volumes as to what goes on when people's heads are turned."	1
Another day, another toll in Syria's civil war: 213 dead. For many around the world, the story of the fighting in Syria is a near daily listing of casualty figures that represent the devastation of war. For those on the ground, it's  a daily reminder of just how close things are getting to a point of no return.That was a point of no return for the Syrian people this week, when the total death toll topped a century-old record, and for the millions of lives it's claimed over the past seven weeks, the war in Syria is no longer something far away. If anything, it's closer than ever.It won't be long before we see the next wave: the next civilian death in Syria. A day after this week's record, it's possible that there will be a new record number on April 2, when the body count will hit a hundred — that's when the toll in Syria has exceeded 100 dead since Syria first became an independent nation in 1946.What next for the war in Syria? We have a limited time remaining before the death toll reaches a tipping point, but there's no telling what it will take. As fighting drags on, and more civilian casualties occur, the fighting will inevitably shift from military to civilian.There is little doubt that many civilians caught up in the fighting are losing their lives in a futile effort to stop the bloodshed. But in the face of a military force intent on inflicting a total defeat on Syria, some civilians will likely be caught in between — and the question will be, how many?The death toll this week:* Seventeen-year-old Abdullah Hamoud died from his injuries in a hospital in the Idlib province.* At least six people died in the Aleppo city of Aleppo, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.* A 21-year-old man died from a gunshot wound in the eastern Aleppo city of Azaz, according to SANA.* The death toll hit its 200th death for a week on Tuesday afternoon, with a woman killed in the village of Dabiq, according to the Syrian Civil War Monitor website, which cited the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.* There were no deaths reported in the Damascus area, and no deaths reported in the area of Qaboun, SANA reported.* A man was killed in Talbisa, in the	0
Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in. Among the more well-known governors who will be leaving office: -- Republicans Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, Charlie Crist of Florida, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina -- Democrats Bill Richardson of New Mexico, David Paterson of New York, Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, Ted Strickland of Ohio and Jennifer Granholm of Michigan Some of them are leaving due to term limits, some were defeated and others sought different offices. Some are leaving after having survived high-profile scandals. Others are departing after weathering a myriad of problems affecting their states. David Paterson, Jennifer Granholm and Bill Richardson will be the first to leave office when their successors are sworn in on Saturday. Richardson told CNN he is going to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and looks forward to becoming a private citizen after having served as a governor, a cabinet secretary, a United Nations ambassador and a congressman. "I'm going to try to set up a foreign policy institute where I continue my work on peacemaking, on rescuing hostages, on U.S.-Latin American relations. I'm going to stay active," Richardson told CNN's "John King USA" program on Thursday. "I'm going to be around -- not in New Mexico politics but more at a national and hopefully international level. But you know I need a pause, the people in New Mexico need a pause from me, probably the country needs a pause from me." Having just returned from a trip to North Korea to help calm recent tensions, Richardson said he intends to stay involved in that issue and other foreign policy matters but doesn't rule out returning to Washington one day. Schwarzenegger's last day in office is next Monday. It has been a roller coaster for the actor turned politician. After first winning office following the recall of his predecessor, Gray Davis, in 2003, he promised a new approach. While his supporters point to major environmental and political reforms in the state, his popularity plummeted as the state's fiscal problems mounted. California confronted major deficits and financial headaches as Schwarzenegger and legislators faced off trying to find solutions to deal with the red ink. In an interview in November on NBC's "Tonight Show," Schwarzenegger said he did not have regrets about his decision to run.	1
A modern-day David and Goliath story is unfolding in Washington state over whether you have the right to know what's in the food you purchase. The outcome will likely have national implications. What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified. In support, you have a large grassroots movement that includes farmers and ranchers, fishermen, business owners and consumers. On the other side, you have a handful of large corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont and Dow that are fueling the food fight by spending millions of dollars to stop the people's right to know. For Ben and myself, it's simple -- being honest with your customers is the foundation of good business. Companies ought to be proud of the ingredients they use and the products they sell, and they ought to be happy to disclose what's in those products. About 60% to 70% of processed foods contain laboratory-grown, genetically modified ingredients known as GMOs -- genetically modified organisms. According to a New York Times poll released in July, 93% of Americans want labels on food with GMOs. Eatocracy: How is genetically modified food labeled? GMO labeling is being considered in almost 30 states. Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory GMO labeling laws. But in a political system where money talks, too often the people are silenced. According to analysis from Maplight.org, a similar initiative failed in California last year after opponents spent $46 million -- five times more than proponents. In Washington, supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors, with the median donation of $25 a pop. The opposition, on the other hand, has raised money from 10 donors, with the average donation of $545,827. As a result, the citizens who support labeling are being outspent three to one. If I-522 passes in Washington, it would be the first no-strings-attached legislation for mandatory labeling. And that's a good thing. It would create the momentum and the precedent for more states and federal protections to follow. In other words, it would be another big win for David. Residents of Washington have a big opportunity to vote yes on I-522 and turn the tide on labeling laws. In the long term, we need to level the playing field by reducing the amount of money that big corporations spend influencing legislation and elections.	1
A top European Union official said Saturday that new sanctions will be proposed within a week against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, but  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko sounded like he can't wait that long. "I think we are very close to the point of no return," Poroshenko said Saturday following an EU summit in Brussels. "The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened in the territory controlled by separatists and where -- instead of separatists -- there are regular Russian troops." Poroshenko said the situation had worsened in the last few days and that thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory. Russia has repeatedly denied either supporting the rebels or sending its own troops over the border. But those assertions have been roundly rejected by the West. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at the summit, said new sanctions will be proposed. "The European Council says that it stands ready to take further significant steps in the light of the evolution of the situation on the ground and it requests the commission to urgently undertake preparatory work ... and present proposals for consideration within a week," Rompuy said. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared defiant in the face of a chorus of Western condemnation over what NATO says is clear evidence of Russian military aggression in Ukraine. Moscow doesn't want or intend to wade into any "large-scale conflicts," Putin said Friday at a youth forum, state-run Itar-Tass reported. A few breaths later, he made the point that Russia is "strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces," making them more efficient and modernized. "I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations," the President said. "This is a reality, not just words." German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in a phone call Thursday that they would have to consider tougher action against Russia. The European Union and the United States have already slapped economic sanctions on targeted Russian individuals and businesses. The union also has sanctioned certain sectors of the Russian economy, prompting Russia to retaliate with its own measures. Port city fortifies The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council, said Saturday.	1
that is, women. As The New York Times put it last week, "The board? All white men. The investors? All men. The executive officers? All men but for the general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks." Question: Why is  there no women on that board? What happened to Gadde?But Gadde's absence did not, of course, mean that she herself is on the hot seat. While the board voted to fire her, Gadde will have the support of "her colleagues" and "her friends" in the board. At least that is how the board's report describes its own decision. As to who exactly these colleagues are and whom they support, they seem not to have been much concerned with Gadde's plight at all."The board had a conversation of mutual understanding, in which they both made their position clear," explained board chairman Stephen Miller. Gadde was fired "to bring about the change in the company" that it had said it  wanted over the last few years.Gadde's firing is far from the first time that powerful white men have attacked women in the workplace. Last month, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, Ed Bastian, took to The Daily Caller to call Hillary Clinton a "thot." And a year ago, in its annual review of the women in its boardroom, The New York Times described an internal report that found a "tacit acceptance" of the notion that women did not enjoy equal opportunity. The Times reports:In its internal inquiry, the board found that two women, Ms. Rakesh Gangwal and Ms. Deborah B. Palfrey, had “had a good experience” in the corporate world, though they had not been in senior positions. A third woman, Ms. Elizabeth P. Cappuccio, had worked in male-dominated positions but had not been promoted, the staff report said.And so the corporate world will continue to find its women in positions of power. But they'll no longer be on the boardroom side of the balance as they once were.	0
Tourists and businesses are already feeling the sting of federal budget cuts, with officials in Wyoming announcing delays for opening parts of Yellowstone National Park. The National Park Service is taking a $113 million hit under the so-called government shutdown, which began with the budget impasse between the GOP and the Democrats.The agency says it is delaying a project that will add more than 9,000 seats on a bridge connecting Yellowstone National Park to the park's east entrance. The project had been expected to be completed in time for the summer, but is now being delayed until December.The decision to defer the bridge project comes after some contractors balked at the $1.5 million price tag of the project, which will be funded primarily by a $500,000 appropriation from Congress that Congress is unable to override.The park agency didn't provide details about the amount it's budgeted will be slashed, but officials say it will have to come from elsewhere in the budget. Congress is set to consider extending its national parks budget by $1 billion, which would make it the largest single appropriations for national parks. The park plans to take $400 million out of its budget, according to the Associated Press.President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is urging the shutdown over border security issues. With Washington gridlocked amid a partial federal government shutdown, President Trump has turned to Twitter, where he has urged people to "get tough!"Trump tweeted Saturday: "A Shutdown is not the answer. It never has, and it never will be! It is time now for Republicans to come together & do what is best for the American people! We need great Border Security! The best and safest way is build a Wall!"The president is facing his most serious public feud yet this winter with the majority of his party in Washington, D.C. Republicans in the House of Representatives on Friday passed a budget that would eliminate funding for the National Park Service, which would cause the first such closure in the agency's history.That means the shutdown could be the result of the GOP opposition to Trump's attempt to crack down on illegal immigration.Democratic Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Jon Tester of Montana said in a joint statement that "Trump is pushing his most extreme views, and has never supported the preservation of the National Park Service. Americans can't afford another shutdown." On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York,	0
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is celebrated on the third Monday in January, although Dr. King was actually born on the 15th of January 1929, 84 years ago. Below are some facts and numbers related to the federal holiday, in which Americans are encouraged to participate in a day of service. 27 -- The number of years since the very first national celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 20, 1986. 1 -- The Montgomery Bus Boycott against segregated seating lasted approximately one year, starting December 1, 1955. This is what Dr. Martin King said in his book, "Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story": We have no alternative but to protest. For many years we have shown an amazing patience. We have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice. 1 -- In a speech delivered one day before his assassination Dr. King said, "Let us keep the issues where they are." Opinion: Martin Luther King's dream is alive "That's all this whole thing is about. We aren't engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody. We are saying that we are determined to be men. We are determined to be people," he said. 44 -- "Everybody can be great because everybody can serve," Dr. King said in his sermon "The Drum Major Instinct," forty-four years ago on February 4, 1968. Mrs. King read the same statement when, in 1994, she asked congress to make the holiday an official national day of humanitarian service. 4 -- The number of days between the assassination of Dr. King on April 4, 1968, and the first legislative bill to establish a federal holiday. Rep. John Conyers (D- Michigan) sponsored the bill on April 8, 1968, 44 years ago. 33 -- The number of years since Stevie Wonder's release of "Happy Birthday," a song asking, in 1980, for a day "in full remembrance." Opinion: Voting rights, 48 years after King's march 6 million -- The number of signatures on the King Center petitions Mrs. Coretta Scott King and Stevie Wonder presented in 1982 to Tip O'Neil, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, in support of a federal holiday.	1
The ideal of childhood, and the protection of its innocence, is a central pillar of both our morality and our legal code. There is, therefore, little that shocks and outrages us more than crimes by adults against children. > > —Mary Kay HaganSomewhere over the last seven decades, we've come to expect the worst from children and to expect to see them as innocent victims of vicious adults. We often imagine children as easily manipulated puppets controlled by adult authority figures, and we are quick to condemn them for misbehaving, usually without a second thought that we would do the same to adult human beings. # **Why Are We So Afraid of the Innocent?**The conventional assumption that adults cannot be held responsible for criminal acts committed by children has, however, a strong basis in fact. This may at first seem strange for a country like the United States, which prides itself on being a nation of victims. A country that prides itself on the equality of the sexes, has been described as "the most child-friendly democracy in the world."  Yet there are countries that are even more socially hostile to children than the USA. In other words, our government's perception of the helplessness of children may be far more common in some of the most authoritarian societies in the world than is the perception of the innocence of children in the USA. # **Children of the Taliban**In 1979, a group of radical students from the Middle East attacked US military headquarters in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government responded by having its own extremist Islamic students attack American and British military bases, with no remorse or shame. The attack culminated in the deaths of sixteen American soldiers and two Britons. The story of the Dhahran incident is told in the film, _The Siege of Dhahran_.  > >  _The Siege of_ _Dhahran_A member of the "Taliban" organization attacked a British Army base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia with an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) (see Figure 1.1). The military quickly responded by firing weapons at the "Taliban" to kill "those on the run" and to prevent a larger attack.  >  Figure 1.1 _The Siege of_ _Dhahran_The US government responded	0
When your grandmother is one of the most famous cosmetics moguls in history, it might put a little pressure on you to succeed. But for Aerin Lauder, the 44-year-old granddaughter of Estée Lauder, who founded the  Lauder Companies in 1962, going all out wasn't necessary.The women of the cosmetics world are different, and what they want to do is different."I always try to be different from what everyone else is doing, and I don't believe that there's really such a thing as best practice," she told CNBC Make It in an interview at the 2017 International Make It awards event.Instead, she said, it's about "keeping the ball in the air and not letting anything crash."Aerin Lauder was born into a family of beauty industry giants, and spent much of her life fighting for the rights of her loved ones as well as the public's rights to use the most famous makeup brands in the world.Her grandmother, Estée Lauder, went from working as a sales-woman at a cosmetics counter to becoming the world's most famous cosmetic company. She used her fame primarily in the cosmetics industry to fight for the rights and the future of her company.Aerin Lauder (L) shares a moment with her grandmother in the 1980s. Courtesy of Aerin LauderAerin Lauder grew up to be a makeup mogul herself. Courtesy Aerin Lauder"She didn't need the money. She could retire and live the dream," Aerin Lauder said. "I'm a lot like her in that regard. I could retire if I wanted to. I could just put the whole family in a house, have a pool and take care of them, and it wouldn't be an issue."For the most part, Aerin Lauder's grandmother was very protective of her. She had her own makeup-only cosmetics counter and trained her employees to treat her and her sisters with respect and dignity."I'm so excited we were able to get all the stories out because it was so good," Aerin Lauder said. "I feel blessed."Aerin Lauder is only the second in a long line of female inventors in the cosmetics industry, after her grandmother.She's also the first to make it to the top in a field where women historically have typically had a harder time making it.Lauder founded	0

Chief Michael Sullivan was arrested in the parking lot of The Capital Grille restaurant on July 15 for public drunkenness. He was released two days later after his lawyer said that there was a misunderstanding and the arrest was a mistake. The police began an internal investigation and now plan to charge Sullivan with making a false statement and obstruction of justice. When asked about the arrest, Sullivan told the New York Times, "I was under the influence. I was very drunk. And I was arrested."December 16, 2010 -- WASHINGTON -- As the city of Boston braces for another snowstorm and bitter cold, top elected officials are demanding a $100 million in federal funding to improve infrastructure in the city. City officials have criticized the administration's request for a $6.5 billion to $14 billion in emergency spending, arguing that it would be better used to rebuild public school buildings in Boston, where funding has been slashed by $1.9 billion in the last three years. The federal funding request was issued Monday as the city is preparing for a new round of snowfall this week. Boston's mayor has promised city workers that they will get an extra day's vacation in December to be able to take advantage of the city's employee holiday for the holiday season. With the winter storm forecast to hit Thursday, Mayor, who is preparing for his first major snowstorm, says he hopes to get the workers' holiday taken advantage of, as well as his city's annual holiday.December 16, 2010 -- Boston, Massachusetts -- Boston Mayor Walsh says he hopes to get the city's employees' holiday taken advantage of, as well as his city's annual holiday.

Open Road Films will release its Steve Jobs biopic "Jobs" on August 16. Ashton Kutcher stars in the title role as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The film is directed by Joshua Michael Stern ("Swing Vote"). Originally set for an April 19 release as a gesture towards the anniversary of Apple's founding, in March Open Road Films pulled the film from that weekend hoping to find a better slot. The August 16 weekend is already fairly full, with wide releases including Universal's action sequel "Kick-Ass 2," The Weinstein Company's drama "The Butler," and Relativity's thriller Paranoia, not to mention limited releases like "Ain't Them Bodies Saints," "Austenland," and "Prince Avalanche," which all played Sundance. That weekend is, however, somewhat comfortably outside the territory of the tentpole summer blockbuster hopefuls. "Elysium," "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters," "Planes," and "We're the Milllers" open the weekend prior. Jobs premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film festival and co-stars Matthew Modine, Dermot Mulroney, and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak. In January, EW's Owen Gleiberman wrote that Gad's performance "strikes the most relatable note in the movie." See the original story at EW.com.	1
Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to claim the Spanish Super Cup in an ill-tempered El Clasico clash. Lionel Messi's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for  Barcelona to win the competition and make it three Copa del Rey titles in four seasons.The victory means Barcelona will now be seeded for the Europa League final on April 2nd after having dropped two points. They will face Russian side Zenit St Petersburg, who defeated Spartak Moscow 4-1 in the Russian Super Cup to claim third place.Messi, who ended the day in the top five in both the Spanish and international rankings, scored the only goal in the 90th minute of football's biggest game to send Barca into the quarter-finals of the European Cup for the first time since 2004.The Argentine was handed the ball in the box by Sergio Ramos, who had come on to replace Xavi after the defender had been withdrawn just before half-time in a change in formation. Messi's one-touch finish was the only goal of the match as he struck a left-footed shot from a point-blank range.In the other semi-final, Sevilla defeated Osasuna 1-0 to advance to the final by a record margin of six goals. In the other semi-final, Valencia overcame Athletic Bilbao 3-2 to win the Cup Winners' Cup final by the same scoreline.In the other match, Athletic Bilbao and Valencia are tied on goal difference, while the same number of goals were scored in the match between Osasuna and Sevilla. The match is also crucial for Osasuna who need a win at home to qualify for the Europa League.Bilbao have already qualified for the competition through their domestic cup, while Valencia have the chance to qualify for the Europa League via their domestic cup and UEFA Champions League.After beating Athletic Bilbao 3-1 in the final on April 1st, Osasuna have qualified for the Europa League by scoring more goals at home than their opponents. Valencia have qualified for the Champions League via the domestic cup.The result means Bilbao will now be the only club without a European tie in their domestic cup this season.

The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar Tuesday after a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for most of his life.Karen Kyaw Myo Thu, the young democracy activist's mother, was not allowed to see her child since the beginning of the year.Suu Kyi's decision to visit the child was made on her own without the advice of any government officials, according to The Irrawaddy.Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, won the country's second election six months after a military coup. The military has remained in office, but the country is becoming more stable on the ground under the leadership of Suu Kyi's party.The younger Myo Thu had been living in a guest house he was given when he was released from exile in Burma in 1991 and taken in by Karen village headman and his wife, who now live in Yangon.From his perspective, his mother was a prisoner in her own home for nearly 21 years."I don't want to go to her house," he said. "I wish she could come here and see me. But she can't do that at this time."Myo Thu, who also goes by his middle name, has been in Yangon since last weekend with his father, a former diplomat in the Burma government.Myo Thu's son, who is now 14 years old and has a son of his own, said his mother was happy to be with her son, but also told him to go back to Kawkare if he wanted to see her again.Kawkare is one of several villages in northern Shan State that Suu Kyi visited in a four-day tour last week. The villages were selected because they had experienced some level of autonomy or self-rule from the central government and had not seen any government repression or intimidation of the village's people.Kawkare is one of the villages where Suu Kyi visited, according to Reuters.Suu Kyi also visited the Yangon International Airport on Friday in Yangon, according to the Irrawaddy.The visit came after a month of delay in the release of a statement from Myanmar's Foreign Affairs Ministry that seemed to indicate that Myo Thu was still detained in Naypyidaw, the	0
one suspected in the fatal shooting of a policewoman and four hostages, the other two in the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine -- and to the freeing of more than a dozen people being held hostage. The French government's work is not  completed, but its progress is notable.Wednesday, February 27, 2012It's been said that it takes two to tango, but it's also true that there's a lot we don't know about what's really happening in Libya. In particular, we don't know much about who is paying for the violence in the North. In the past, the rebel groups that emerged from the revolution have struggled to make their money sustainably.In other words, who is paying for the war in Libya? Are rebel groups making money when their bombs are targeting civilians? Are the governments making money when they're paying their mercenaries?Until we know, it's hard to make any judgements.And that is the problem: we don't even know who is paying for the violence. One thing we do know is that the United States does not, and may never, have the ability to pay for the violence.Monday, February 25, 2012From time to time, we post items from news stories we're particularly interested in. This week's comes from the Guardian, who have an interesting article about the "unwatched revolution" in Egypt, the results of which, they say, may be "the biggest security threat to peace in the Middle East since the 2011 unrest in Libya."Here are excerpts:"A new survey by the Pew Research Center – which is made up of 5,000 people across the Middle East, Africa and North America – suggests that it's not just Egyptians facing the threat of security forces, but that many other countries are concerned about the potential for unrest in 2011.The survey found that over the past year a quarter of those polled (27 per cent) had been worried about unrest in their countries, and 14 per cent were very worried. And some countries have seen large increases in those fears, both for 2011 (Egypt increased its threat level by six percentage points) and the past few years (Jordan).While the study does not include the threat of US military forces in the region, Egypt's threat level actually increased from a low of 2.7 (the study's highest) in 2010, the year	0
Long lines lingered in some key states after polls closed in most of the United States, but voters and election officials reported few snags in Tuesday's balloting. In Florida and Virginia, people who were in line at the end of voting hours were allowed to cast their igs in the early hours of Wednesday.In Virginia, a state where Democrats made strong gains, voters complained they were waiting in line for hours. In St. Louis, Missouri, hundreds of voters waited in line for at least three hours before they could cast their early ballot.In some states, including Michigan, Missouri and New York, there were a few unusual, and at times confusing, reports of voters who reported being turned away at polling places or had their ballot rejected. Some voters said they had to wait nearly two hours to cast their ballot in Ohio.But in most states, lines at early-voting locations were relatively orderly, as voters patiently waited for their ballots to be counted.At several early voting locations in Florida, like this one in West Palm Beach, there were reports of people waiting in line for hours.Voters in Pennsylvania were particularly active on Tuesday, with nearly twice as many people voting early as in 2012. They also waited in line more than two hours.In Florida, people waited an eternity in line in the Miami-Dade County, where several polling places were opened a day early, and in Palm Beach County. Voters in both counties reported waiting six to seven hours in line.In all, there were 16,879 people in line for early voting in Florida, compared with 11,948 in 2012.In Virginia, where Democrats make up 60% of the electorate, the state had 1,743,000 voters who were registered to vote on Election Day, up from 1,650,000 in 2012.In the Miami-Shore area, more than 50% of polling places in both Broward and Palm Beach were opened one hour early to handle the surge in early voters.In St. Louis, voters waited more than three hours to vote.In all, more than 11,300 voters waited more than two hours in line in St. Louis.In Indiana, voters waited at least two hours to cast their ballots.Ohio voters filed in at 1,200 polling places. Only in Cleveland did more than 1,000 people wait	0
She is small but only in physical stature. Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy. The 66-year-old human rights icon defied Myanmar's authoritarian military junta with her quiet demeanor and urn-breaking protests after a military-drafted constitution in 1988.Yet when she spoke to TIME in late 2018, she did it with anger. "I know what it is like to live under the junta," she said. "But we have to find ways to deal with all the problems we have — not just with the junta, but with all the problems we have."The former opposition leader is a fierce advocate for universal basic income, which she says could alleviate the poverty in her country without requiring massive government intervention, and that would make it easier for her country-to-be to follow in the footsteps of other successful democratic societies. She insists her proposal of $1,000 — called the "Loya Jirga" — should be made an official policy of their own republic so that its success and the work of other nations may inspire and motivate people of Myanmar today.In recent years, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn on her personal experience, and on the inspiring story of her country's struggle, to build her case for why the idea of a Universal Basic Income is so important for the people of Myanmar. Suu Kyi has gone from prisoner to global icon by speaking out. In 2018, she became the first woman, and the oldest person, ever to deliver a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.In her speech, Suu Kyi called for a living wage that could "make a difference in the lives of the people." "Myanmar's economy is failing; we need to create a sustainable livelihood for all the people," she said. "When children grow up with nothing to eat, they will develop illnesses, and then we will all die. That is not the way to live life, and people in the world need to learn to live in balance with nature and do not destroy it with our own lives."In other words, a living wage would make the nation's poor — who make up more than 80 percent of the population — better off, because it would raise the incomes of most people. But Aung San Suu Kyi made it clear that it's not enough to simply raise people to a level that would be	0
Well, the Senate says climate change isn't a hoax. Phew. But are we causing it? Oh no-no-no, says half the Senate. Forty-nine senators (full list here) voted on Wednesday  to block action on the United Nation Framework, which if adopted would include a ban on new fossil fuel production and combustion in the lower 48 states and the closure of coal-fired power plants.That sounds pretty great. But that's just one of the votes. The other 53 would have blocked a vote.That's a pretty big list of senators with serious concerns about climate change, and a vote to block action on global warming and its causes would be a big one.Now, the Trump administration is claiming vindication. After the vote, the official Twitter account of the secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, Rick Perry, proclaimed, "The US Senate is on the right side of history and should follow the will of the voters and the Constitution. We did the right thing on human-caused climate change."Now, there's at least one problem with that. A big problem.You see, there was no will of the voters in this vote. All 47 senators—no one from Trump's party—voted against the U.N. Framework. A total of 38 Democrats, all from swing states, did so. In fact, all of the senators who could be considered "centrists" voted as well.The Senate is not a body of "centrists." It is the body of Democrats who are willing to say no and say no often.As for the Founding Fathers, they didn't care that a country could be destroyed by an angry mob. They cared about protecting liberty and were willing to endure a bit of mob violence to do so.And while there certainly is room for dispute on the details, scientists know that global warming is definitely happening. That's been confirmed by recent global temperature records, such as NASA's Global Historical Climatology Network, which shows that Earth has been growing warmer and warmer for more than a hundred years.For some who don't believe the science, the will of the scientists might be enough to keep them from flying their airplanes into the Arctic or drinking champagne out of bottles made of gold. But what the scientists have demonstrated is that we are definitely messing up the planet.The most important point in	0
The father of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager whom the Taliban tried to kill, has been given a job in a Pakistan consulate in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from gunshot wounds to her head and neck, Pakistani officials said Wednesday. Ziauddin Yousafzai has been appointed education attache and will function as head of the consulate's education section for three years, the Pakistani government said. His job could be extended two additional years. At the time of his daughter's shooting, Ziauddin Yousafzai ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. The Taliban forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them. Malala was shot by gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school. She had blogged fearlessly about girls' education and accused the Taliban of thriving on ignorance. Her father's employment fulfills a pledge by Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, who visited Malala in December and assured her father that the government would meet "all expenses of Malala's treatment and all the needs of the family while in UK," a government statement said Wednesday. "In light of that, the present appointment has been made," the statement said. On October 9, Malala was on a school van in Swat Valley when Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was Malala. They identified her. Malala was then shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack. "We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us," a Taliban spokesman said after the shooting. He vowed to come after her if she managed to live. Islamic militants also threatened to kill journalists covering her story. Since her shooting, Malala has become an international figure. She was selected as runner-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2012. CNN and Time are owned by Time Warner Inc. Malala arrived at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham on October 16. A bullet that hit her left brow didn't penetrate the skull but traveled the side of her head under the skin and into her neck, the hospital said. The shock wave shattered the thinnest bone of her skull, and fragments entered her brain, the hospital said. The teen had been in critical condition, but doctors removed the bullet and she has no major brain or nerve damage. Physicians said she will need reconstructive surgery.	1
The North Koreans know how to put on a show and this year -- the 60th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Korean War -- they've gone all out for the Mass Games. If you've toyed with the idea of going, this is the one event you should probably attend. But what is it exactly?North Korean soldiers march in the mass games.Why You Should GoWhen it comes to celebrating the victory over South Korea, the North Koreans haven't minced their words. In June 1951, a joint North Korean-U.S. army force crossed the 38th parallel to attack South Korea and bring its capital, Seoul -- to the United States -- before the two countries were brought to the negotiating table.In the aftermath of the war, the North Koreans demanded an end to U.N. sanctions and a halt to U.N. bombing of North Korea and were eventually granted their wish. But North Korea also wanted to hold a demonstration to honor the dead from the war and show the world its people are not only "dear, loyal and brave," but also "strong and brave."The Mass Games is designed to look like Kim Il Sung's Birthday.The North Korean government also wants to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Korean War. However, in the late 1940s, the U.S. wanted North Korea to cancel the games or at least modify them. But the North Korean government relented after the U.S. threatened to sell the North Korean newspaper that it was hosting the games in.All the Kim family had to do was fly down to South Korea and they'd be treated like VIPs.How to Get inTo get in on the action, a military police battalion from the People's Armed Police needs to be sent to your hotel. The next day, they'll escort you through the city to the military parade grounds.From there, you'll walk over to the Mass Games, which is on a hill overlooking the DMZ. You'll get dropped back into North Korean territory, then have a boat taxi to the stadium and another ferry to the stadium on the other side of the DMZ.The view from the Mass Games.The Mass Games are divided into two parts. The first part is on August 31 and the second part is on September 1. The games are both outdoors and take place	0
Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire. Her first thought was about her 17-year-old cat, Kramer. "I don't have children on my own, so my cat is like my child. I became hysterical," said Donnelly, 50. "What if (he) didn't make it?" Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze. Then Red Paw Emergency Relief arrived. The nonprofit assists pets and their owners when disaster strikes. Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals. "Everyone who received their pets started to cry," said Donnelly. No one was hurt, but the Donnelly's apartment had severe damage, and they weren't sure where they were going to stay. Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer. "When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well," Leary said. "Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people." Since 2011, Leary and her group have provided emergency assistance to nearly 1,000 animals and their families throughout southeastern Pennsylvania. Like the Red Cross, but for animals Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer. She would often arrive at a disaster scene and see traumatized survivors struggling to care for their pets. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes "They'd ask, 'What am I supposed to do with my dog? Who is going to help find my missing cat? How is my pet going to get medical care?" said Leary, 36. "There just wasn't anyone there to help the other part of the family." Pets were sometimes taken to shelters or abandoned. The situation broke Leary's heart.	1
Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the "American Idol" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants. In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door. ÂIn a case of two birds with one stone, the "Idol" judges gave Kris Allen the first and only opportunity to sing a show-stopping duet with the man next door."He's a musician; he's a friend of mine," Ryan told a sold-out theater of 1,400 fans. "I think we all have some people rooting for us, and I think we also share that. I think we all want Kris to win this whole thing.""He's a great kid who deserves this," Mike told the same audience."He's a real good musician, a fantastic singer, and his voice is so natural that it's just unbelievable."And so the two singers, who were brought back from obscurity after their first audition, got the first real chance to shine on the show.Before the performance began, Allen asked, "How are you feeling?""I'm ready to have a great show," Lambert told him."You mean like one of those big Broadway shows," Kris replied."Well, not necessarily," Allen said, adding, "I think it will be great."At the end, Allen held his arms out wide, the crowd held their breath and the two men bowed deeply and kissed before they returned their respective instruments to their laps.But in a dramatic final turn, Allen and Kris gave each other a standing ovation, tears pouring down their faces."Oh my gosh, I hope they do well," Lambert said. "We'll get you an autograph.""It was a big moment," Allen said. "He thanked me, I thanked him. And I said, 'Welcome home,' because I'm happy to see him happy.""I wanted to put out," Kris replied. "That was awesome.""I'm just so happy," Allen said. "I'm happy. It was awesome."But at the end, neither Allen nor Kris was able to give the other much of a chance to sing."The first one always wins, and that's okay," Kris told his partner. "	0
This month on Road to Durban, CNN's Robyn Curnow, Nkepile Mabuse and Ayesha Durgahee meet in Johannesburg, South Africa's most populated city, to explore the ers-and-ems, or extremes of food.This week, we get the best of both worlds, as Rian Wafo and Yvonne Mafileo join CNNGo News for a look at the world of food waste in South Africa:As a child growing up in South Africa, I recall being inspired by the incredible abundance of produce in my country. We were used to seeing our neighbors’ gardens over the fence and, if an apple fell from the tree, we all knew there was a tree in the backyard.In my eyes, that abundance is still alive in South Africa.Every grocery store in this country, no matter how small the shop might be, has a refrigerator stocked with the best South African produce.The local produce is simply amazing and I was a little bit jealous when I would see other neighbors’ gardens in other parts of the country.I could not understand what made me envy a neighbor so much that she could afford to grow her own food and it still took her months to even get a few cabbies to accept her groceries at the curb.What does food waste really mean?Food waste is a complex topic. It is often thought of as a simple black hole in the food chain. It causes unnecessary suffering for the millions of people who are estimated to be suffering from hunger in the world.In South Africa, food waste occurs from the moment a food item reaches the farmer to the moment it ends up on the table of someone else. This is one element of the problem.The second element is that South African farmers have to spend the equivalent of three weeks to make a single kilogram of vegetables. There is no way to make that volume of food in less than three weeks. It can only be stored for three weeks.That means that the farmer must find additional sources or grow an additional 20 to 40 kilograms of crops to feed a single family.This means that the world is losing about 2.7 million tons of food every year.This is the second element.Is South Africa really the world's "food basket" or is it the world's "big	0
President Barack Obama officially begins his second term today, a day ahead of his public swearing in and all the pomp and ceremony of a U.S. presidential inauguration. Because the Constitution calls for the president to be sworn in on January __________, the date of the most recent presidential inaugurations, this will be the first swearing in ceremony for the second president of the United States since Richard Nixon resigned in 1974. The ceremony will be held at the U.S. Capitol, and will be broadcast on U.S. television networks to a world-wide audience. For the first time in history, the event will be broadcast live to the people of virtually every country on the planet.The United States government was in an uproar over Obama’s plan to extend the term for U.S. presidents from two to four years. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives refused to pass the extension, in opposition to the wishes of most members of the U.S. Congress, and to the wishes of most Americans. But what was really at stake was not just Obama’s time in office, but its credibility.After a long campaign for the presidency, Obama’s presidency will depend on the success of a new Democratic-controlled Congress. In the short term, Obama wins in the Electoral College, but the Senate elections will be decided by the Republicans, who hold a narrow majority and will not be able to block Obama should he win the White House. Many analysts say that because Obama will be able to appoint more liberal judges to the U.S. Supreme Court, the chances of more progressive decisions in the coming years can’t get any worse.But Obama’s presidency also depends on the strength of the U.S. economy, which remains fragile. Unemployment has remained extremely high, and the pace of job loss will continue, especially in the service industry. If the economy continues to falter, the fiscal and budgetary policies of the Obama administration will become all the less credible.The Democratic Party also has to take on the tough battle for control of the House of Representatives in the next few years. If the party can’t win the elections, or if Democrats lose a significant number of seats in key districts to Republicans, the party will lose control of the House of Representatives. In the short term, the party will need to make some major electoral adjustments in response to the 2010 national elections.If Obama	0
It's fun to imagine what Michael Mapes' studio must look like: You would assume that the New York-based artist's workspace has to resemble the lab of a harebrained entomologist, with test tubes, specimen bags and ents and all. The thought was not too far-fetched in the case of Mapes, a self-taught artist from Los Angeles who has been making abstract paintings for more than five years. "He doesn't really know how to make anything, so he just makes things up," says Jennifer Dombrowski, Mapes' assistant. But Dombrowski, who worked with him on the show, likes Mapes, and she says he's an artist's artist. "He knows how to make a good painting, and he actually likes to make them—not just for himself, but for anyone else who might stumble across them."In fact, Mapes is a little more than a painter. He is a multidisciplinary artist, and his work ranges from sculpture, to video, to the handmade. But perhaps his best skill—one he has displayed in nearly everything he has made— is the creation of a world of his own imagining. And one that is built on his experience as a person who is in awe of the world as it is.A new body of work by New York–based artist John Maeda, known for his work involving electronics and computer images, is coming soon to the Museum of Modern Art. According to his website, the work is a "documentary-like journey to present and future worlds." It is inspired by the fictional characters featured in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, and is created using only the colors, sounds and objects found in the story of Bradbury's novel."The artwork started as the idea for a video game," Maeda told us in a telephone interview, adding that he is an avid fan of Bradbury's work and began thinking of ways to include and illustrate it in a video game. Bradbury wrote a series of stories about a town run by a government which is controlled by the books it collects—in the form of books, magazines, newspapers and other objects—and one such story, called "The Coldest Month," is about the idea of how a society can be controlled through books. "The book, 'The Coldest Month,' is basically a book from 1945, which shows the idea of how people in	0
Missing Florida pilot Robert Wiles, who was believed kidnapped and held for ransom 21 months ago, now is believed to be dead, and a former co-worker is in custody, accused of his death, the FBI said Friday. Authorities arrested Stobert "Tobie" Holt Jr., 42, Friday in Orlando, Florida, after he arrived from Colombia, where he was on a business trip, according to Tampa-based FBI spokesman David Couvertier. Holt faces state charges of first degree murder, kidnapping, extortion, and intent to inflict death or serious bodily harm, the spokesman said. The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said. Though authorities now believe Wiles was killed, they don't know where his body is, he said. The arrest was uneventful, Couvertier said: "Holt was advised of his rights and said nothing." A four-count grand jury indictment was unsealed Friday in Polk County, where Wiles, then 26, ran a branch of his family's international aircraft maintenance business, National Flight Service, at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport. The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared. He was among several employees who told investigators they last saw Wiles on April 1, 2008, at the office and had no clue what happened to him. The FBI won't reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared. At the time, agents said Wiles' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing. Holt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company. Authorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida. Wiles was single. When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned. "All that he ever worked on was customer relations. Making things better for the company," co-worker Jerry Grief said at the time. "Make the customer happy and make them come back."	1
Fascinating, vibrant and multicultural. Those are a just a few of the words Dubai's visitors use to capture its essence. You can never prepare for how the ever-shifting landscape will seek to change something within you as well. The larger-than-life grandeur of its towering city skyline, fleet of construction cranes signaling progress and crowded, fragrant souks -- or markets -- all combine to present the swirling scene of Dubai. But in order to soak up Dubai's eclectic diversity, you have to prepare for another truth: "Dubai is worth a trip, but not all that glitters is gold," iReporter Holger Bauer said. Knowing how to navigate the city is key to making the most of your trip. But don't let a fear of the unknown keep you from setting off on a Dubai adventure. "It's a crossroads of many cultures," iReporter Derek Matthew Koebbe said. "They have a 30-year plan to become one of the largest economic and tourist regions in the world. I would love to travel there again to see this progression." Dubai's captivating mystique, beauty City with a view For first-timers or repeat visitors, taking in the breathtaking view of Dubai from the top of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is a must. "You can get a very good view and 'lay of the land' by going up to the top floors of buildings, such as hotels or the Burj Khalifa," Anderson said. "Going to the viewing deck of the Burj Khalifa in the evening is especially magical. You can view the nightlife below as well as the dancing fountains show, which is absolutely spectacular at night." iReporter Sara Ruedy recommends taking the elevator ride up to the 160th floor for a 360-degree view of Dubai's overall splendor. And while visiting the Burj Khalifa, located in the heart of downtown Dubai, don't forget to explore the "large variety of trendy restaurants, aesthetic pools and fountains, and upscale shopping," she said. What to do, where to go Dubai is full of activities that cater to any traveler's whimsy. From the adventurous recreationalist to the avid shopper, this city is a treasure trove just waiting to be explored.	1
Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help. In a statement aired on a private Libyan television channel, one of the three main Zintan groups in Tripoli said that at least two members of the force defending positions at the airport were killed in a rocket attack. Al-Qaaqaa brigade said at least three other people were wounded. A photo posted on several Zintan Facebook pages showed a makeshift clinic set up inside the airport's main terminal. CNN could not independently verify when the image was taken. The government in a written statement said early Tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session "a potential request for international forces to solidify the state's capabilities" at an emergency session. While Libyan officials have called for calm, the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces. Many of the armed groups are on the state's payroll. These circumstances make it very difficult for the government to gain control over this latest increasingly volatile and violent situation. Still the government on Tuesday called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for the militias to withdraw within a week at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the airport. It said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities, including the airport, will face charges of murder. A resident who lives near the airport told CNN families in the area are fearful they will be killed or injured by what appears to them as indiscriminate shelling. The Libyan government statement said peacekeepers might give it a chance to build a suitable army and police force. More rocket attacks Local media reported earlier Monday that rockets had hit the airport. A CNN crew could hear sporadic gunfire and explosions in the direction of the airport. The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed. It also said 90% of the airliners parked there had been damaged as had the control tower. The damage to the planes, many of which belong to the two national airlines, is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the government said. The United Nations announced that it had evacuated its staff. "This is a temporary measure," the United Nations said in a written statement. "Staff will return as soon as security conditions permit. The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."	1
No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives. That's the message at the core  of the new documentary "Harassment" by filmmaker Emily Alpert and producer Rachel Seidman.The New York Times talked to Alpert in May about the inspiration for the film, which chronicles the experience of five women who turned to violence or self-harm after they experienced sexual harassment, inappropriate touching or unwanted affection from a male friend. Alpert and Seidman interviewed all five women, and the two say they were in many ways inspired by the "I Survived Suicide" documentary.Alpert is a writer, producer and editor who has directed the films "Killing My Mother" (for which she won the 2013 Sundance Grand Jury Prize) and "The Death of Samantha" (2011); Seidman is a producer. Both have a history of working on documentary films on suicide and suicide prevention. (They both made the short documentaries "My Husband Is a Monster" and "The End of Eden.")I met with Alpert and Seidman to discuss the documentary, the response to the film and their experiences working on the project.Gillian T. Hanks: What inspired "Harassment"?Emily Alpert: My story is this: I was doing this documentary that I called "Killing My Mother," which follows four women who killed themselves after they experienced sexual harassment or abuse. And then I found myself at an all-too-predictable place, you know? I was in a very unhealthy relationship with a man, he was physically abusive and controlling, and I was in a relationship with another one at the time, also physically and emotionally abusive. And this was happening in the same city. And I was realizing that I was a danger to myself. So I decided to break up with my partner, and I went into a depression and a spiral.And during this time I was reading a book called "I Survived Suicide" which was about the experiences of women who have killed themselves -- not necessarily in the context of sexual trauma -- and I was really struck by the idea of not just talking about the sexual trauma, but it was more about talking about the broader kinds of issues that go along with that. And I thought, how can I build a larger body of work	0
Four men accused of involvement in a foiled terrorist plot against Western targets went on trial Wednesday in Germany. Fritz Gelowicz appears in court on April 22 in Dusseldorf, northern Germany. Three of the men -- two Germans and a Turk -- were arrested in September 2007. Authorities said they had begun mixing a huge amount of explosive material that could have resulted in a strong blast, bigger than the attacks in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005. The three -- Fritz Gelowicz, Martin Schneider, and Adem Yilmaz -- are charged with membership in foreign and domestic terrorist groups, preparation of explosives, plotting to murder, and plotting to commit a crime using explosives, the court said. Schneider is also accused of attempted murder, the court said. The fourth person, identified in German media reports as Attila Selek, is a German citizen of Turkish descent. The German magazine Der Spiegel said prosecutors are still searching for a fifth man they believe played a central role in the alleged plot. The trial is taking place at the Higher Regional Court in the northern city of Dusseldorf. When Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were arrested, they were found with sophisticated and difficult-to-obtain detonators, authorities with knowledge of the arrests have said. U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time. Gelowicz and Schneider are Germans who converted to Islam. Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany and was well known to German authorities, officials said. The trial could last up to two years, Der Spiegel reported. The trial's paperwork reportedly fills some 530 folders and the prosecution plans to call 219 witnesses, the magazine said. A little-known Uzbek militant group, the Islamic Jihad Union, claimed responsibility for the plot days after the arrests. It said the intention was to target both U.S. and Uzbek targets, said German Interior Ministry spokesman Christian Sachs. German authorities had said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan. The group said it wanted to target the United States' Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, Sachs said.	1
The popular uprising in Syria against the Alawi-led minority regime of Bashar al-Assad poses a serious challenge to U.S. national security in the Middle East. As it fights for its survival amid escalating violence, the Syrian regime risks not only the deepening of civil strife in the country, but also provoking sectarian strife in the region, potentially drawing in U.S. military involvement. Washington has thus far been cautious in dealing with Syria, favoring strong words and sanctions against the regime and supporting Arab efforts to stop the violent military crackdown. But this could change as conditions in Syria deteriorate. The recent arrival in Syria of Arab observers, as part of a Syrian-endorsed Arab League plan to stop the violence, has been met with mixed emotions. Syrian opposition members rejected the plan, which was mediated by Iraq, on the grounds that it will give the bestial regime another chance to continue its brutal policies. Syria pipeline attached amid ongoing killing Burhan Ghalioun, the head of the Syrian National Council opposition movement, emphasized that the observers cannot do their work because "they cannot go where the authorities don't want them to go." The Arab League's initiative is further tainted by the contemptible presence of Sudanese Gen. Mohammad Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, who heads the mission. Al-Dabi held high military intelligence and security positions in the government of President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted on international charges of genocide in Darfur. Meanwhile, Syria continues its slow, steady descent into sectarian strife. There is the militarization of segments of the opposition, as manifested by the creation of the Free Syrian Army, and the targeted sectarian murders committed in mixed towns, especially in Homs. Indeed, the recent twin suicide bombings in Damascus, regardless of the identity of the as-yet-unknown culprits, could well be a portent of what may happen in the multireligious, multiethnic country. This premonition of escalating violence is shared by many in the region, including those within the ranks of the Syrian opposition. Syria is tightly linked both to the evolving Arab politics -- as influenced by the past year's Arab popular uprisings -- and to the ongoing shifts in the Saudi and Iranian-led regional axes of powers that have resulted from withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.	1
Listening to writer Brian K. Vaughan summarize the plot of his comic book, "Y: The Last Man," makes it sound like just another pulp title. Brian K. Vaughan says he's "depressed" about the end of "Y: The Last Man" but he also says the last issue should be the best in the entire series. This is a series that's seen a dramatic fall from grace and will likely survive only as a curiosity as well.Writer Brian K. Vaughan knows what he's doing, having written "Ultimate Spider-Man" and has now decided to try his hand at a "Y": the comic book equivalent of a "Blade Runner." He says he's doing a story in "Y" like "Blade Runner" and a story in a different comic like the "Gangsta Grillz" comic.Vaughan was a guest in my "Comics in Review" podcast with my regular co-host, Jim Vorel. In this interview he details his approach to writing the comic book "Y: The Last Man" and why he thinks he has to leave it.The book has been in development for four years. I’m sad about the ending of “Y Last Man.” It’s supposed to be the end of the comic book version of “Blade Runner” but it’s not the way I would have ended the series. The ending of “Serenity” and “Hemlock Grove” I was so happy with. “Hemlock Grove,” when it was done was the best comic book ending I’ve seen in years. I hope it’s “Y: The Last Man” is gonna end in a way that I’m happy with.A common refrain when talking about the end of “Y: The Last Man" is the idea of a satisfying ending but it's not like the books that came before it. After Brian K. Vaughan left the book, Scott Allie had a new artist, Eddy Barrows, the series was retooled, and the new ending is more like what should have happened after “Ultimate Spider-Man.”I’m not saying it’s a bad ending but it’s not what I would have wanted to see.

Rafael Nadal is closing in on an eighth trophy in nine years at the Barcelona Open after storming past Canada's Milos Raonic 6-4 6-0 in the semifinal on Saturday. After a four-hour delay for rain, the Spaniard was soon behind as the No.5 seed won an early break. But Nadal fought back in typically ferocious fashion to take the first set and then overrun Raonic in the second to reach his seventh consecutive final since returning to the ATPTour in February following a knee injury. "I think it was my best match of the whole week," Nadal said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. "He played a fantastic second game on the return. I won the third game, which was very important for the match, because if you are 3-love down against a big server like Milos, you're in big trouble." Nadal will face compatriot Nicolas Almagro in the final at the Real Club de Tenis. The No.4 seed had a similarly straightforward semifinal match against Philipp Kohlschreiber, downing the German 6-2 6-1. "I think I played one of my best matches here in Spain. I felt really good all the time during the match. I'm really happy to be in my first final in Barcelona ... " Almagro said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. "Every match I play against (Rafa) is fantastic. I'm ready for everything, so we will see what I can do on court." It is the 20th time the 27-year-old has reached a World Tour final but he has a 0-8 record against Nadal -- the most recent defeat coming at the semifinal of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in February. Meanwhile at the WTA event in Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova booked at place in Sunday's final after beating Germany's Angelique Kerber in three sets 6-3 2-6 7-5. The 26-year-old Russian eventually prevailed in two hours 16 minutes. After being taken the distance by Lucie Safarova and Ana Ivanovic in the previous two rounds, Sharapova dominated the first set of the semifinal breaking Kerber twice. But once again Sharapova was pegged back in the second, as the German rallied to take the set comfortably.	1
Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was hiding an illness from his employers and had been declared "unfit to work" by a doctor, according to German authorities investigating what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable pilot to do something he would later regret, fly into Belgian skies and kill all 150 people on the plane, including 20 children.Lubitz, who was 28, and co-pilot Anton Dringesser, 30, flew their Airbus A320 from Barcelona to Amsterdam in late 2014. The plane crashed on landing in the Dutch town of Maalbeek, killing all 152 people on board, half on the ground and half on the air.The French prosecutor investigating the crash said Lubitz had "a mental condition of autism".But a German doctor at a hospital in the German town of Leipzig said, in a report seen by the Associated Press, that Lubitz told him that he had been diagnosed as "psychiatricly disabled" in a report sent to his employers.Lubitz had been working for the German aerospace company DASA, the German manufacturer of the Airbus A320 aircraft, a spokeswoman for the company said.The German aviation authority said it would ask the Paris prosecutor's office to order the French air transport agency to launch an investigation into the crash.Investigators will also look at the possibility that Lubitz deliberately made a deliberate error.A statement from the German Federal Aviation Agency said that it had to "continue to analyse the causes of the accident" because German-based aircraft operators "are subject to criminal proceedings in several cases on account of the protection of the air industry."German media reports cited French prosecutors as saying that Lubitz and Dringesser were flying the plane with their "knowledge and consent", though the French prosecutor said he was not sure about this point.Lubitz, also known as Andreas Lubitz, wore medical headphones to listen to music and movies on board the A320, according to a court document describing his behaviour on the flight.The German-language publication Der Spiegel said the flight suit he was wearing when the crash occurred was purchased through Amazon and had the number "66417" on it. Amazon confirmed that the suit was purchased and was authentic.The Dutch-language tabloid De Volkskrant said Lubitz "probably had an illness" and that his co-pilot	0
Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)When Ryan Sallans, an activist in the Nebraska transgender community, first went to the doctor in 2005 to talk about what he medically needed to do for his gender transition, his doctor wanted to offer urn as a gift, and not just to help him feel better and not to get rid of the body he felt he had. But when other doctors refused the urn, he did not. As Sallans puts it, “I had to take that doctor’s advice and I took up the urn, and I buried it beneath my yard.”Sallans says he is not a hero for choosing not to accept a body. “That’s not heroic, it’s cowardice. I’m not asking anyone to go through with surgery. I’m saying to everyone else, listen to me and listen to me and listen to me,” he says. “My actions are not heroic, but they’re not bad. I’m not saying people wouldn’t do it if I had said, ‘you know what, maybe I don’t feel comfortable,’ so let me go to surgery and get it over with. The reality is people are just going to get weird feelings and then they’re going to get angry about it, or feel guilty about their feelings.”Sallans says he did not feel like a hero because he didn’t think about death. “I don’t think I ever thought about taking the death right in my body or about being in a body I had to let die. I never thought about that,” he says. “I just did the thing I did.”Sallans says that after giving him the urn, his family took it away and buried it in a place that they decided was important for him. “As they came back into the world, I remember thinking, what am I going to say to my family when they see that thing?” he says.Sallans says being with the urn was not traumatic enough. He says he would like to have buried it in a place with more meaning.Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)As far as he knows, there is no law in Nebraska that requires medical professionals to provide trans-aff	0
When Bela Fleck told us he had been missing something in his life musically, he caught us off guard. Bela Fleck traveled to Africa to immerse himself in banjo-related culture. Keep in mind: Fleck is considered by many to  be the world's most innovative banjo player. His music is a fusion of traditional music of various cultures and the blues, while also incorporating jazz and rock at times.In addition, Bela was a professional musician with a master's degree from the prestigious Berklee College of Music. He is also a gifted songwriter. His first single was released in 1995, and he has been with Elektra Records for 20 years. We talked with Fleck about his journey as a musician.MusicJock.com: Where were you born? What did you do?Bela: I was born in Chicago, but we lived in North Carolina and New York.Jock: What were you doing when you were 6 or 7?Bela: I had been really interested in doing all things music for as long as I can remember. My father was music major at Harvard, and he had always encouraged me to do it. He used to say that it was the only way to make a living.When I was 13, I played the violin for the first time and knew that this was what I wanted to do. I used to put my name down when I was young, so when I was 18 I went to Harvard and got a degree in classical music. I did all string and wind ensembles in college, and I spent a lot of time playing the banjo and ukulele. When I was a senior in high school, I started doing some really cool stuff with the blues. I got really into the Robert Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson, Robert Lockwood, and so on. Then I got into the early jazz and also listened to the John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and John Patton.On my first trip to Africa, during the early '70s, I listened to the original stuff. After all, I was a kid! So I was really into the blues and playing with Robert Johnson. I didn't realize that I was doing more than I was doing. I was really into the music and I wanted to take all this knowledge and get it out into the world. To me it seemed like a	0
Australian wonder mare Black Caviar extended her unbeaten streak to 25 races in some style on Saturday, blowing away her rivals in the TJ Smith Stakes at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse. Her 25th victory was also her 15th at the sports highest level, overtaking the mark of 14 Group 1 wins set by the legendary Kingston Town in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was in 2011 that Black Caviar posted what many consider her greatest-ever performance in this very race, beating Hay List by three lengths after trailing him by the same distance coming into the home straight. On this occasion no such heroics were required. Facing one of her toughest-ever fields, including her old foe Hay List, admittedly not the force he once was, and the in-form Bel Sprinter, Black Caviar's regular rider Luke Nolen had to jockey for position in the early stages as he sought to overcome an unfavorable inside draw. The decisive move came around 300 meters out, when Nolen guided her away from the softer ground by the rail and settled her behind the leaders towards the middle of the track. From there, all Nolen had to do was pull the pin and the six-year-old instantly responded, lengthening away from the rest of the field with her to claim her eight consecutive Group 1 win. All day Sydneysiders had celebrated the presence of one of Australia's most popular sporting heroes. Flags in her trademark salmon and black colors fluttered over Sydney's iconic harbor, while the capacity crowd ensured Randwick Racecourse was filled the rafters. Speaking after the race, Black Caviar's trainer Peter Moody praised the crowd, adding that he was "extremely proud" of his mare for breaking Kingston Town's record. As Black Caviar was cheered on her way back to the winners' enclosure her jockey noted, "You can see what she means to racing. To be part of that -- words escape me." With Black Caviar's form seemingly better than ever despite her age, her connections have hinted that a return to Royal Ascot, scene of her narrowest-ever victory, may be on the cards later this summer before a rendezvous with Frankel in the breeding shed in what would surely be considered the racing world's own royal wedding.	1
A visa, toothpaste, spare underwear. All essentials for a decent vacation. But what about something less substantial -- a pleasant welcome when you arrive? After all, the friendliness of the people you meet often determines whether your memories of a place are fond or foul. Now welcomes have been rated. The apartment-rental website HouseTrip.com (which operates on a similar model to Airbnb) has crunched the numbers on 130,000 of its users' European city reviews. And the city most often given a five-star rating across the seasons for its all-round cheeriness was that capital of grand boulevards and paprika-scented restaurants, Budapest. Lisbon scored second-best for the quality of its welcomes overall, and Amsterdam came third. More: 11 things to know before visiting Hungary Welcome secrets The secret of a good welcome? HouseTrip reckons it isn't so complicated. "Budapest is a consistently good option because costs are so low," said the website's CEO, Arnaud Bertrand. "Travelers feel like they get what they pay for ... which leads to them feeling happier and more satisfied with their stay." So it's all about being cheap. Yet welcomes seem to be seasonal. While Budapest scored highest throughout the year, it wasn't the most welcoming city in any one season. Instead, Paris was the most convivial city in spring, Rome in summer, Amsterdam in autumn and Berlin in deepest winter.

But "friendly locals and cozy bars mean our guests love the [Berlin] experience," says HouseTrip.com. Solo travelers, si!

Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in. Among the more well-known governors who will be leaving office: --   California Gov. Gray Davis, who has been a vocal critic of   federal electricity regulation and who has been at odds over California's   debt-financed rescue -- Also leaving: --   Nebraska and New Mexico, both which have been in bankruptcy -- Also leaving: --   New Hampshire, which has been a vocal opponent of gay marriage. -- New York, which has been a focal point of the Occupy Wall Street protests and whose new governor is not expected to make changes in that state's financial   laws.  As we do every year, FERC and its staff released a comprehensive report on wholesale power markets this week.   It showed that in the first half of this year, the U.S. and Canada did more trading on the wholesale market than ever before, accounting for about 20% of all power traded.   The two countries also traded more electricity between March 16 and April 20 than any other two-week span since FERC began keeping this data nearly 15 years ago.   The new FERC findings came on the day that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed new limits on wholesale trading and, in effect, re-asserted its power over the market. The report also showed that wholesale trading volumes are down in the fourth quarter of this year because of continuing problems in the California wholesale market, which is suffering its own troubles.   Although wholesale power markets can be characterized as a "market" in part because they affect the operations of virtually every type of business in the United States, they do not operate in a vacuum. Markets have to work in the context of the broader economy, to which they respond by meeting their economic and other needs and responding in some ways to the regulatory framework that supports them.   The report released today is an important opportunity to make the case for deregulated wholesale markets as the centerpiece of our nation's infrastructure investment strategy.   The report by staff from FERC's Power Market Practices Task Force shows that the recent volatility in wholesale prices is a reflection of both supply and demand fundamentals in the energy industry.

Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman. The comedian confirmed the Judd Apatow-produced film was moving forward during an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon" on Wednesday, but wasn't able to divulge too many details just yet. TV on the Radio make Paul Reubens a race car driver for 'Happy Idiot' video "There is going to be one," Reubens said. "And I was hoping I could make this huge announcement tonight, but it's a week away, I think, from being announced." Reubens, however, did say that production on the film would begin next February and that a director had been hired as well, though he wouldn't say who. "Steven Spielberg?" Fallon cracked. "Steven Spielberg!" Reubens gamely responded, before shaking his head no and adding: "It's called P.T." As Reubens noted, news of a new Pee-wee Herman movie, and of Apatow's involvement, has been bouncing around for the better part of three years now. The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include "Arrested Development" and "Comedy Bang! Bang!" â€” though what kind of adventure the titular hero will embark on remains unknown. Own Pee-wee Herman's 'Big Adventure' bike The Pee-wee persona originally developed in the 1970s, evolving from Reubens' early improv work with Los Angeles troupe the Groundlings. After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of "Saturday Night Live," Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with "The Pee-wee Herman Show," which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special. Of course, Pee-wee became a major star once he hit the big screen with 1985's Tim Burton-directed "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." The success of that bizarre comedy helped Reubens launch a TV series, the eventual cult-classic "Pee-wee's Playhouse," in 1986. A film sequel, "Big Top Pee-wee," was released in 1988, though was a critical disaster and relative commercial flop.	1
Melissa Huckaby, the former Sunday school teacher accused of kidnapping, raping and killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, will face additional charges that she tried to poison two people, including another 7-year-old girl. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing Sandra Cantu and attempted poisoning of second child. A revised complaint against Huckaby, 28, of Tracy, California, was made public just hours before she was due back in court on Friday. The new charges caused another delay in the murder case, CNN afiliate KRON reported. The complaint charged that Huckaby "did willfully and unlawfully mingle a harmful substance with food or drink" with the intent to harm the child, identified only as "Jane M. Doe." Another alleged poisoning victim was identified as Daniel Plowman, but no age or other information was immediately provided. The latest charges also include one count of child abuse endangerment relating to the unidentified child, who was allegedly in Huckaby's "care and custody." Read the complaint (PDF) Huckaby did not enter a plea in the Cantu slaying in her first two court appearances last month. At an earlier hearing, Judge Linda L. Loftis agreed to keep the autopsy and toxicology reports under seal, citing a "great danger of public outrage." If convicted on the murder, rape and kidnapping charges, Huckaby, could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, authorities said.

For some, Twitter is a social media platform that enables you to keep up with breaking news, raise political issues or offer amusing thoughts. But for many others, including myself, Twitter has become the new "Fight Club." It has in essence become the cyber version of the basement of "Lou's Bar" from that 1999 classic film. To those who have not made it onto Twitter yet, let's make something clear: Twitter is not Facebook. Facebook is as dangerous as visiting a P.F. Chang's. Twitter, on the other hand, is the Wild West in the 1800s -- it's new, unsettled and often savage. In "Fight Club," people from all walks of life -- from professionals to blue collar workers -- would nightly shrug off their mundane existence to experience a visceral rush by beating the crap out of each other in the basement of a neighborhood bar. "Fight Club" celebrated the duality of life. By day, actor Ed Norton played a mild-mannered, timid insurance adjuster leading the quintessential life "of quiet desperation." But by night, Norton became his brash and bold alter ego, Tyler Durden, portrayed by Brad Pitt. The difference between these two characters was succinctly summed up by Tyler Durden while talking to his more staid alter ego: "I am free in all the ways that you are not. " This is what Twitter is to many. A place to be free. A place where people from all walks of life are on equal footing to battle each other -- from the rich and powerful to the poor and angry. And on Twitter, you're not required to be polite like you are in the real world. In fact, cutting and snarky remarks are not only accepted, they are glorified. But there's an increasingly dark underbelly to these Twitter fights. What might start out as a disagreement about a political or social issue, at times can escalate into racist, sexist or homophobic rants. In fact, Humboldt University recently created a map entitled "The Geography of Hate" which charted the hate filled comments being spewed on Twitter. It's truly alarming.	1
Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity will not be enough to ensure a continuation of the government she would like to lead after Germans go to the polls - and a newcomer on the political scene could throw a wrench in the gears of her plans for the nation. Despite standing 20 points higher in the ratings than challenger Peer Steinbrueck of the SPD, Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are unlikely to secure enough votes for an absolute majority. It is actually the Chancellor's own camp in the political spectrum of the right that threatens the current government, made up of the Christian Democrats and their junior partner, the liberal democratic FDP. The upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could deliver payback to Europe's paymaster, because of Chancellor Merkel's ad hoc reactions to financial instability in the Eurozone. With a populist platform cloaked in its profile as the "party of professors," the nascent AfD touts an anti-euro platform, and is channelling supporters away from the right and enticing protest voters. Together, they could be enough to help the AfD garner the five per cent of the vote they need to gain seats in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. The party currently scores between 2% and 4% in the polls. Read more: Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with eurozone? If they succeed, it could then be difficult for the current government to muster a majority. Just as suddenly as the AfD party appeared on the scene earlier this year, consensus on Germany's role in Europe may disintegrate in Berlin, since there is now a conservative political voice breaking the taboo on questioning Germany's integration within the European Union. Neither the political parties nor the German electorate has mobilized around any burning issues this campaign season, but the AfD has tapped into an undercurrent of frustration about the euro and unease about Germany's economic resilience. Merkel has steered Europe's biggest economy well during the global economic crisis: today, unemployment is under 7% and Germany's export engine is the envy of many countries. Two decades after reunification, the nation seems to have reached the zenith in economic indicators, but looming in the background are structural factors such as a demographic decline and income disparity which, coupled with aiding Eurozone countries in the periphery, creates unease among this nation of savers.	1
He's just 15 and the world is seemingly already at his feet. Last month, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest Ã¢ÂÂ and a fair amount of cynicism.I know, I know; it's only a game. But what's fascinating are the underlying issues: how quickly the boy from Norway Ã¢ÂÂ a country where football, as many people point out, is still a religion - is taking his opportunities.Martin Odegaard in action for Liverpool during the Premier League match between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur on August 14, 2017 in Liverpool, Merseyside.

But after a series of impressive performances in the youth team, - including an individual goal for the U17s against England Ã¢ÂÂ his father decided to make the decision he'd been mulling over."I was thinking about the possibility of making Martin a professional footballer, but for a few minutes I wasn't sure I'd make the decision," said his father, Tor-Erik."I was afraid of him playing for a year or two in the youth team and leaving us without knowing what to do with him. But then my wife said the reason she didn't want to give up her job to raise him is because we want him to get a proper education. We want him to be able to get a job when he finally decides to make a career out of football."At 8-10, Odegaard has his eyes set on a starting spot in the Norwegian top flight. He's signed a pro contract with Breidablikk FC and hopes to start his professional career here in 2019.As for his father, he's looking forward to what's to come."Sometimes you can be thinking that your child is going to grow up in a bad neighbourhood, maybe without being able to make it to a proper football club, but in the end it all works out.

Political tensions flared Wednesday after more than 70 people were killed when fans rushed the field and rioted at a soccer game in Egypt. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife caused the clashes in the northeastern city of Port Said. Hours after the fighting, protesters in Cairo chanted, "Down with military rule." And the secretary-general of the Muslim Brotherhood party blamed Egypt's military for the deaths. Egypt's interior ministry blamed fans for provoking police. A committee will investigate the circumstances surrounding the fighting, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement early Thursday. The clashes left at least 74 dead, Egypt's health ministry said in a statement. At least 1,000 people were injured, 150 of them critically, ministry spokesman Dr. Hisham Shiha said. Most of the injured had concussions and deep cuts, he said. The fighting occurred in a stadium in Port Said after the home Al-Masry team beat Cairo's Al-Ahly team 3-1. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs, said Mohamed Sultan, head of the ambulance association in Port Said. Many of those who died fell from bleachers inside the stadium, according to Ahmed Saeed, an official from the Port Said governor's office. Others suffocated, said Al-Ahly fan Amr Khamis, who returned to Cairo early Thursday with his head bandaged after an Al-Masry fan beat him with a wooden stick. "The police opened the gates separating us from the Masry fans and their hooligans attack us with everything: rocks, glass bottles, knives, swords. Some had guns. ... How did the police allow them with these weapons into the bleachers?" he said. Authorities contributed to escalating violence, said Mamdouh Eid, the executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee. "The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late. I carried several dead fans in my arms," he said. Tension was building throughout the game, Eid said, as Port Said fans threw bottles and rocks at players. "There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle," said Gen. Marwan Mustapha of Egypt's interior ministry. "Our policemen tried to contain them, but not engage." At least 47 people were arrested after the clashes, he said.	1

The White House confirms that Syria has crossed a "red line" by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces, prompting the United States to boost the "scale and scope" of its support for the opposition. The determination, disputed by the US and Western allies, comes as Syria's forces reported that rebels have captured the town of Mayr al-Bab, a strategic site for the future supply route to Al-Kiswah. The White House also said it will increase US assistance to the rebel Syrian National Council's (SNC), which is the main opposition body after the fall of its leader, Ahmad al-Jarba, who was killed in an air strike in Damascus, on Tuesday. The SNC, which is close to the CIA, will be able to use CIA-supplied aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and training to continue aiding in the battle against President Bashar Assad's troops, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Syrian forces have claimed earlier that rebels drove the Syrian Defense Forces from Al-Kiswah. The opposition's information minister, Omar Abdul Karim, said on Wednesday that the army had cut the rebels off from the highway linking Syria to Lebanon and Iraq. He cited the capture of several villages on the Al-Kiswah road by forces loyal to Assad. The White House said Washington believes Al-Kiswah is important in the supply route to the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front which has taken over large swaths of Syria and has carried out gruesome attacks against civilians. The SNC, which is based in Turkey, says it has a presence in about 25 countries, including Washington, Turkey, European capitals and Australia. Syria's state media denies the army has captured Al-Kiswah and says the town is held by rebels. Assad's forces have made gains in recent days, but are fighting for survival in a war that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and over 1.4 million children. White House spokesman Carney told reporters travelling with him to the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, that Washington was "fully committed" to ensuring that rebels will continue to receive additional assistance. Carney said the situation in Syria presents a situation where "we've got to have	0
The Puerto Rico Police Department has a long pattern of violating citizens' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches, the Justice Department said in a report released Thursday. The analysis by the Justice Department's civil rights division found the U.S. commonwealth's police force is "broken in a number of critical and fundamental respects." Bucking the trend of decreasing crime in the United States, violent crime in Puerto Rico increased 17% between 2007 and 2009. The island has also seen a number of large protests in past years over issues such as the cost of public education and job cuts. Police confronted these challenges with too heavy a hand, the report said. In response to student protests in August 2009, police used chemical agents, batons and physical force against protesters, according to the report. Protesters at other demonstrations have been met with chokeholds and rocks thrown by police, the report said. Puerto Rico has used excessive force that has violated and suppressed people's right to exercise free speech, the Justice Department said. There is also evidence of unlawful search and seizure that violate the Fourth Amendment. Many of the abuses come from the police department's strategy of sending tactical officers for community policing, according to the report. The Justice Department also found the police department fails to police sex crimes and cases of domestic violence, and discriminates by targeting people of Dominican descent. "We find that these deficiencies will lead to constitutional violations unless they are addressed," the report said. It is a "longstanding practice" of the department to use force -- including deadly force -- in cases where lesser force or no force would have sufficed, the report said, adding that hundreds of people have been unnecessarily injured. The Justice Department also contends that there are problems not just with the way the Puerto Rico police department carries out its functions, but among the officers themselves. Between 2005 and 2010, there were more than 1,700 arrests of police officers on charges ranging from theft to murder, the report said. Current police policies fail to guide officers, and there is a lack of oversight by superiors, according to the report. Training is also insufficient, it said. Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno said Thursday that long before the Justice Department report, his administration had already sent a 150-page study to federal authorities outlining changes the police would undertake. Fortuno said he was aware there were problems at the police department for years.	1
I was going through my Twitter feed Monday morning when I came across this: "Happy greatest day of the year, #Boston!" And so it is. Or was, until about 2:50 p.m., when explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon transformed a celebration into a scene of carnage. What matters now, needless to say, are the victims â€” the dead, the injured and their families and friends. But if you are looking for some insight into Boston at this horrible moment, it helps to understand why our marathon matters and where it fits into our civic psyche. Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year. To begin with, Marathon Monday is a holiday â€” Patriots Day, an annual commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Not everyone has the day off, but many do, including schoolchildren, for whom this is the first day of spring vacation. That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way. In a city and a region obsessed with tradition, you couldn't ask for more than the oldest marathon in the country coinciding with patriotic re-enactments of colonials versus redcoats, all playing out against the backdrop of the budding spring. Today was cool but sunny, and -- finally -- with not a filthy black snowbank in sight. It's a time of year that gives us hope of better days to come. Rothkopf: In the face of terror, keep calm To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds. The runners stream through Kenmore Square, a block away from where other, considerably better-paid athletes are engaged in more sedentary pursuits. The Sox beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 on Monday. There wasn't much time to celebrate. The explosions came less than an hour later. As a spectator sport, the Boston Marathon probably hit its peak in the 1970s, when local favorites Bill Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson were dominating the race. These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years.	1
The family of ISIS hostage and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig released a YouTube video Saturday asking his captors to show mercy and free him. Referring to him as Abdul-Rahman -- a first name his family says he took, having converted to Islam while being held hostage -- father Ed Kassig said: "We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go." Peter Kassig, 26, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. His mother, Paula, addressed her son in the video: "We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people," she said. "Most of all, know that we love you, and our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need," she added. The couple noted they were releasing the video on the same day of Islam's Eid al-Adah or the Festival of Sacrifice, when Muslims slaughter lambs, goats, sheep and cattle and distribute the meat to the poor and their families. The holiday coincides with the end of the hajj pilgrimage and commemorates Allah's sparing Abraham from sacrificing his son Ishmael. A native of Indiana, Peter Kassig founded Special Emergency Response and Assistance, a nongovernmental organization aiding Syrians fleeing the civil war there. Since 2012, he delivered food and medical supplies within and outside Syria and provided trauma care and training, his family said. But on October 1, 2013, he was "detained" on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria while performing a project for SERA, his family said. Peter Kassig's life was threatened Friday in an ISIS video that showed the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. In a statement Friday, Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, confirmed that their son was being held hostage by ISIS but provided no other details on his abduction.

Celebrities are no strangers to charity work: Bono created his ONE campaign to fight global poverty, Angelina Jolie travels the world as a United Nations good will ambassador, and the recently named  Kardashian sister-in-law, Kim, joined her sisters’  H&M campaign to fight global poverty. And after spending time on set with her fellow “BFF”, Kate Gosselin, it seems we’re all in on the ‘BFF’ action – because last night was the first ever celebrity auction of its kind, with a live auction of some of the most famous faces in Hollywood and beyond, offering their time, their talents and their treasure for a charity of their choice.The auction was part of a massive celebrity philanthropy drive, which was started by the American Red Cross in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and hosted by Bono himself, the current chief executive of the U2 charity, one of the most beloved charities in the world, one that has raised millions for famine and disease relief around the world.The auction was hosted on Friday at L.A.'s historic The Roxy Theatre, and took place during one of the charity’s biggest fundraising days (which happened to be Bono's birthday!), drawing over 400 people on Thursday, who spent over $7 million on items ranging from a private jet in Hawaii to tickets to the Los Angeles riots of 1992, and a signed baseball and baseball glove from the late, great Willie Mays.The Red Cross has been the top American charity since it was founded more than a century ago, and has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize six times. It has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in military equipment alone. “America is one of the world’s most compassionate countries, and the Red Cross is an extraordinary force for good,” commented Bono, who co-founded the Red Cross and who has traveled to Haiti four times in response to earthquake, while touring Africa himself for famine relief. “Now, we need as many people as possible to continue our lifesaving work, and we need to give something back to those who have supported us in good times and in bad.”Among the celebrity participants were Ashton Kutcher, who was a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show on Tuesday to talk about his charity	0
Four years later, consider the role reversal: As he closes his convention, Barack Obama's greatest challenge is to make the case against change. Yet he can't ask the American people to simply stay the course. The challenge, both daunting and delicate, is to make the case that his first-term policies were correct but that the second-term results will be dramatically different. Veteran Democratic pollster Peter Hart says the president's challenge is to provide a clear and credible answer to this: "Why will you be better off in the second term?" And Hart argues that the stakes, already high, are higher still now because of the strong prime-time performances of first lady Michelle Obama and former President Bill Clinton. "This convention is now a home run derby," Hart said. Four years ago in Denver, Sen. Barack Obama sold himself as the candidate of hope and change, presenting himself as a different brand of politician, someone who would change Washington -- and the economy -- for the better. Obama to speak after forceful Clinton endorsement But if Washington has changed at all, it is for the worse. And while both sides can find statistics that support their arguments on the state of the economy, it is clear that many Americans at best feel they are treading water. So the tone is very different in Charlotte than in Denver. So is the targeting. Four years ago, the goal was to expand the map, and the Obama campaign ultimately succeeded. This year, the path to 270 Electoral College votes and victory is less certain, though the president does have more viable options than does GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Still, because of the changed climate, the Obama acceptance speech will close a Democratic convention that for the most part has been a giant get-out-the-vote rally, speakers chosen because of their appeal to specific constituencies (African-Americans, Latinos, suburban women, gays and lesbians) or major battleground states. The most sustained appeal to undecided or independent voters was Wednesday's prime-time dissertation by Clinton. Speaking to supporters Thursday morning, the president talked broadly about his test of convention success. "Hopefully, at the end of this convention, people will say we accomplished what we needed to and delivered our vision for the country and offered a clear contrast to what people saw in Tampa," the president said.

As tens of thousands of athletes, team officials and visitors gather in London ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony on Friday, security is paramount for the Games organizers and British authorities. And perhaps the biggest headache of all is the challenge of safeguarding the more than 100 heads of state and foreign dignitaries who will attend the opening ceremony at the Olympic Park -- Queen Elizabeth II, first lady Michelle Obama and U.S. presidential hopeful Mitt Romney among them. But should visitors and competitors be worried? Security concerns hit the headlines this month when it emerged that private security contractor G4S, which was supposed to have provided 10,400 guards for the Olympics and Paralympics, would not be able to deliver. As a result, the government is deploying 18,200 troops -- many more than planned and almost twice as many as are in Afghanistan -- in order to remedy the shortfall. About 1,200 of those were called up just this week after being placed on standby. Nonetheless, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the minister responsible for the Games, said Tuesday that the government "continues to have every confidence that we will deliver a safe and secure Games." The decision to call up the extra troops was down to ministers' determination to "leave nothing to chance," as they prepare for the largest peacetime event ever staged in Britain, he said. "G4S numbers continue to rise significantly and we have every expectation that will continue to be the case," Hunt added. With three days to go before the opening ceremony, G4S said it had around 5,800 security personnel deployed at Olympic venues, with more being trained and accredited "each day." Last week, it said it hoped to have 7,000 fully accredited by the start of the Games, still thousands fewer than it was contracted to provide. While the recruitment failure by G4S is highly embarrassing for the company, the Games' organizers insist that their contingency planning will keep everyone safe. Visitors can certainly expect to see far more visible security measures in place than usual at Games venues and transport hubs. The Ministry of Defence is also guarding the games with two warships, Typhoon jet fighters, Puma helicopters and, perhaps most controversially, surface-to-air missiles on apartment buildings near the stadium, despite objections from residents.	1
Peru's ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu should reopen April 1, more than two months after a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated the small South American nation.Officials from Peru's government, the U.S.-based National Geographic and New York non-profit group Expedition Peru are leading the effort to reopen the site that was declared an archaeological site by Ecuador. But it remains unclear whether the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami have been used as a cover-up by the government."I can only say that when we were living in Peru, there was no question about the existence of Machu Picchu," said Geoffrey Thomas, the director for Latin America at National Geographic. "It was an absolute must-see," he said.This is the first time Machu Picchu has come up as a topic for discussion at National Geographic. Expedition Peru's president, Alan Arnette, joined the board of National Geographic in 2008, and they've been involved in the planning process for months.If Machu Picchu reopens later this month, it will be the subject of an exhibition at the National Geographic headquarters in Washington. It also will be on exhibit in other cities and towns around the world, which Smithsonian officials said should be announced in the spring."It's very important that we get Machu Picchu open," said Smithsonian spokeswoman Rebecca Moore.The earthquake struck Peru on March 12, toppling parts of Peru's capital, Lima, into the Andes, killing thousands of people and leaving tens of thousands homeless. The magnitude of the quake raised fears of an undersea earthquake. It was later determined by scientists to have been caused by a major undersea volcanic eruption and tsunami."I think they had their hands full getting the earthquake out," said Arnette. "The fact that an earthquake, a tsunami has hit the coast will certainly create some uncertainty, and for sure there will be some skepticism."There are currently three main theories about the magnitude of the earthquake and whether it was caused by natural or man-made causes.According to the Washington Post, the U.S. Geological Survey recently concluded a study that said the earthquake was the result of a magnitude 7.5 and 8.0 earthquake at a depth of 20 kilometers under the sea, and the tsunami was caused by a magnitude 9.8 earthquake that struck at 38 kilometers beneath the sea. Scientists believe the earthquake was	0
Authorities investigating the case of a boy who disappeared in Kansas almost a decade ago plan to search an undisclosed residence Wednesday, the Butler County sheriff said. An age-progression photo shows what Adam Herrman would like today, as a 21-year-old man. Sheriff Craig Murphy would not disclose details about the residence or why authorities want to search it. He said his department will also search on an area of the Whitewater River, in southern Kansas, on Saturday near where Adam Herrman was last seen. Adam was 11 when he went missing in 1999. He was living in a mobile home park in Towanda, a town about 25 miles northeast of Wichita, with his adoptive parents, Doug and Valerie Herrman, authorities said. Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing. They "really rue the fact that they didn't" report him missing, he said Monday. A few weeks ago, an undisclosed person contacted the Wichita-Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Child Unit, expressing concern about Adam, the sheriff said. The Herrmans told Eisenbise that Adam ran away frequently, the attorney said, and they believed he was either with his biological parents or homeless. Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, "they were very worried about him," Eisenbise said. In an interview published Tuesday in The Wichita Eagle, Valerie Herrman said Adam ran away in May 1999 after she spanked him with a belt. She said she was upset but doesn't remember why, The Eagle reported. The couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking. The couple adopted his two younger siblings as well, according to The Eagle. "We love him, and we made a terrible mistake" by not reporting him missing, Doug Herrman told The Eagle. The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left. "Then we came to the conclusion that the police probably have him, and they're coming to us, probably to get us in trouble," Doug Herrman told the newspaper, but the "police never came."	1
For 70 years, survivors of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor have captivated listeners with their firsthand accounts, recalling buddies who died in their arms or the glasses worn by a low-flying Japanese pilot. They have iced the decades-old war by showing why the United States, with its mighty army and powerful navy, is the greatest military power on earth.But as listeners turn on the television or open their bookshelf to the pages of books written about Pearl Harbor, they may be surprised to find the true causes of the war.One such cause is an article by historian William J. Perry that’s been reprinted dozens of times in popular works. Perry wrote his book “Pearl Harbor and the Undeclared War” more than three decades ago and has received praise for it. But that article has also been the subject of a lively debate about its accuracy and accuracy.In a way, Perry’s article is still a living document. It has become a point of reference for the many people who dispute the basic tenets of Perry’s argument or who are simply fascinated by the story.In the middle of the debate over Perry’s conclusions, a small group of historians, scholars and researchers wrote an open letter to Perry, asking for clarifications on a series of points raised in the article — and the article — that they believe are misleading or exaggerated. (See a complete collection of their thoughts in Perry’s response here.)Perry, a University of Oregon historian, wrote his article in the 1950s for the history journal “Pacific Historical Review” and is still considered a classic of the field. It has been reprinted in dozens of popular books about the war or the Battle of Pearl Harbor, including a book that came out this year by veteran journalist Peter Morici and author Thomas B. Allen, “America’s Pearl Harbor,” which has a foreword by Perry.Perry has said he spent many hours researching and writing his article, which was published in four volumes over a period of six months. But the letter from those historians is a fascinating glimpse into the deep research process that went into the original article.This interview is the first with Perry after he returned from his long vacation in Europe and Asia. He did not respond to requests for comment. But here are some excerpts from that letter, edited by	0
Peru's ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu should reopen April 1, more than two months after rain stranded hundreds of tourists at the popular spot, the government said. Heavy rain in January unleashed mudslides that cut off roads and blocked a rail line between Machu Picchu and the nearby city of Cusco. Water levels at the Vilcanota River have receded enough to allow repairs to the rail line, said Martin Perez, head of Peru's Ministry of Exterior Commerce and Tourism. "We expect that starting April 1, we will start to receive the millions of tourists who always have come," he said Tuesday. Peruvian officials were forced to use helicopters to evacuate more than 1,000 stranded tourists last month. Authorities estimated that 10,000 people were affected by the rain and 2,000 homes were ruined near Machu Picchu. At least seven deaths were reported.	1
Remember the time United Airlines broke a guitar? Dave Carroll does. He's the musician who three years ago turned his misfortune into an Internet sensation. His video, "United Breaks Guitars," got a million views in just four days and  convinced many that a broken guitar is a good thing.The story takes place at a recent rock concert in San Diego. Two men are talking about the event to a woman who is walking by. She walks by while the men chat about how awesome the event was and how they wish they could have attended. Suddenly, a young man with a guitar is walking up a ramp. He stops in front of the men and starts playing.At first he plays the song "Livin' on a Prayer." But halfway through, he begins to play one that's about anger. As the music plays, the woman passes by to check on the concert with the two men. When she watches the young man playing the song, she becomes frustrated. She walks by, and the young man stops playing and faces her. It's then she starts to walk away. Just before she can escape his clutches, she stops and looks back. And there, on the guitar, is a guitar that's broken, with several of the frets severed.She walks right up to the injured instrument, checks that it's not bleeding, and puts her hand on the guitar for a few seconds before she leaves. It's then that Dave takes his phone out for a picture of the guitar. When she walks back to the men, she shows them what happened to her as she looks at the broken guitar.This happens. This actually happened. We went to talk to Dave.We talked last week and this story was on the evening news, the first place I thought to check out Dave Carroll. We were in a hotel room at a rock concert where this song was playing. It was a great chance to catch up with a musician who has been gaining momentum in the past few months, who recently released a single called "What's Your Name" that was recently certified platinum for sales of more than 300,000 copies in the United States.This particular song is about "what happens when you lose a guitar.""I had a bunch of guitars at home," Dave Carroll said over the phone. "One is broken, but I took it to guitar school. Two weeks later I got it back.	0
In the white sand beaches of Yoff, the small fishing town just north of the Senegalese capital Dakar, a seemingly endless line of brightly colored boats dots the Atlantic seaside. It was here, about  west of Dakar, that I first became fascinated with the African game fish, which is now popular all over the world. These creatures are not what people generally think of when they think of the ocean's fish diversity: they are, as the name implies, the ocean's true fishmen. The angling world refers to them as "dugongs" because their size is quite similar to the African dugong, which is actually a marine mammal.Although they are fish, not mammals, an important distinction exists between these animals and the animals we commonly refer to as fish. Fish, of course, are in the phylum Chordata, which includes all the animals that swim in or have one type of backbone; they have lungs and a heart. But chordates are not fish, and there are no organs that are not present in all fish: their hearts, eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. If one of these organs disappears or is reduced, the animal is incapable of surviving and reproducing.In contrast, the term "dugong" is used to refer to a family of marine mammals that actually belong to the class Mammalia, meaning that their bodies are almost entirely comprised of water. They also have lungs and kidneys, as well as a spinal cord that extends from the backbone directly into their skin. Their body temperatures can be as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius. All these features have evolved independently at least two times in the history of life.The chondrichthyan fish family is quite diverse. They range from the rather large eel-like, fish-like angler fish to small, toothless, chunky, almost worm-like creatures called the catfish. Even though the angler and catfish look very different, they both share in common their name—Anglerfish is a common name for the chondrichthyan fish family. This means that the family that includes them is called Anglerfish, or more correctly, anglers.The origins of the angler fish family are quite surprising. Scientists believe that they first evolved at the bottom of the ocean, where they survived by hunting tiny single-celled animals called picoplankton. This lifestyle makes	0
New laws going into effect Sunday cover some of the nation's most contentious issues, from immigration to abortion, while others deal with tanning beds, tuition and where you can sell a pet. In all, nearly 40,000 laws were enacted in 2011, Â a record for the most recent year in which new federal laws are recorded.Among the highlights:______________* -- A measure intended to restrict where people can carry concealed firearms is being challenged in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union and 12 states.The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would bar states that do not allow residents to carry firearms openly in their vehicles from receiving federal highway funds unless they create their own reciprocity agreements with other states.It would also require states that ban carrying firearms in their cars to establish a process for obtaining licenses and permits to carry in their vehicles -- a federal requirement. The restrictions on handguns would extend to other "arms," like rifles, shotguns, and semi-automatic firearms.Under the law, if a state passes it and another state refuses to join it, the former cannot receive federal highway funds. A third state's decision not to be a party could require it to pay for the costs of a court battle in which it could be held liable for what would be millions of dollars in federal highway funds.__________* -- The bill that would make it easier for children to sue their parents is being considered by the Legislature.The Parent-Child Defense Act would allow a parent or guardian to sue a child for a civil action for damages -- up to $100,000 -- for a "wrongful act" committed after the child turns 18.Legislation to make it easier for children to sue their parents has been in the works since 2006.It would make it easier for children to sue their parents for violating any part of the law that requires a parent to send or send a child to school.The act would allow a child to sue their parents for not providing food, clothing, shelter or medical care.It would also make it easier to file a lawsuit against parents for failing to take a child to a doctor as prescribed or to do certain things as required, such as provide for a child's health care.However, it would prohibit a person from suing or bringing	0
Bolivian President Evo Morales on Sunday pledged to continue his hunger strike until Monday, Â±Â± to press for a free and fair presidential election.The hunger strike began Saturday.Â±Â±On Saturday, Morales held a press conference announcing his hunger strike and the reason: to make clear his support for the right to free and fair presidential elections, when their results are announced on May 3.A total of three Bolivian journalists were detained over the weekend at different points in the country.On Tuesday, they were all released from the Bolivian prison.“The three of us were detained in Manu, in the border zone, for two days. On Friday we were arrested, and they took us to the police station. They told us that we were detained for being journalists.“The next day, Saturday, they let us go. We were released, and we came here. They also let us go yesterday,” said Mario Vargas Llosa, who had traveled to Argentina to attend the trial of the three journalists who were jailed in Bolivia.Â±Â±At the press conference on Sunday, Morales acknowledged that the hunger strike would continue until the election results are known on May 3.Â±Â±Speaking to the press, Morales said, “We’ve given more than 300 days of hunger-strike to demand the rights of our people. We will continue our hunger-strike until Monday. Let’s leave it at that.”Â±Â±Morales added, “My father and I have spent 30 years fighting for truth so that we have the right to elect our leaders.”Â±Â±Later on Sunday, the Bolivian president addressed the nation with a simple message: “We are not going to lose. We are going to continue our hunger strike until Monday.”The ruling party and many opposition leaders have promised to respect the Bolivian constitution’s timeline for announcing election results.Â¶Â¿Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶Â¶	0
NASA plans to capture an asteroid and start sending astronauts aloft again by 2017, even with a tighter budget, the U.S. space agency announced Wednesday. The Obama administration is asking Congress for just over $17.7 billion in 2014, down a little more than 1% from the nearly $17.9 billion currently devoted to space exploration, aeronautics and other science. The request includes $105 million to boost the study of asteroids, both to reduce the risk of one hitting Earth and to start planning for a mission to "identify, capture, redirect, and sample" a small one. The plan is to send an unmanned probe out to seize the asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon, where astronauts would study it. "This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we ever have before ... to places humanity has dreamed of for as long as I've been alive," NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told reporters. The Obama administration has said before that it wants to send astronauts to explore an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars by 2030. Forget falling stars: NASA plans to catch an asteroid Wednesday's budget request would include another $20 billion to study near-Earth asteroids -- doubling the current spending on that effort. The funding is aimed not only at finding a suitable asteroid to explore, but also at "protecting the planet," Bolden said. That concern got new attention after February, when a nearly 150-foot asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of Earth. That one was expected -- but the same day, an unrelated, 45-foot space rock plunged into the atmosphere and exploded high over southwestern Russia, injuring an estimated 1,200 people. White House science adviser John Holdren told a congressional committee in March that as few as 10% of asteroids more than 150 yards wide -- which he called "potential city killers" -- have been detected. NASA's budget request includes $822 million for the agency's Commercial Crew Program, its push to resume U.S. space flights through private companies by 2017. Bolden called that the "bottom-line" figure, warning that any cuts would mean delays. NASA has already hired the unmanned SpaceX Dragon to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, though no commercial manned missions are currently under way.	1
In an unprecedented action, the NCAA is restoring scholarships to the Penn State University football team that were originally lost last year when the school was sanctioned for its handling of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. Sandusky, 69, a former  assistant football coach, was convicted of sexually abusing eight boys while they were children. The case is one of the most disturbing in recent American history.Sandusky and the university admitted he sexually abused the boys, but their defense was based on the testimony of a discredited Penn State medical expert. That defense was based on an email written by the doctor, Richard Strauss, who helped invent the S-word in the 1950s and is considered one of the most-used and discredited medical authorities in the world.The email, "The Science of Evil," was obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. Strauss wrote that the world's worst sexual abusers were "pedophiles," but he did not consider pedophilia to be a sexual orientation. "You don't grow up to be a pedophile," he said in the email, which was sent in October 2013. "You don't grow up to be a rapist."In his testimony on that day, Strauss admitted that the definition of pedophilia in his field of study is a little unclear, calling himself "a little fuzzy on the details" when it comes to the subject area. "As a science writer, it's all relative," he said, later adding: "I've seen a lot of people grow up, become religious, become atheists, become homosexuals, become virgins."Penn State President Graham Spanier took Strauss' position in this case as well. In a memo, Spanier wrote, "We cannot be surprised that Dr. Strauss would want to cast a harsh and negative light on pedophilia for personal and political gain. But we do also not disagree with the doctor that some pedophiles abuse children for sadistic pleasure."The school defended its handling of this case when it lost its football program in September 2013. The NCAA sanctions were later upheld by the federal courts, which did not decide on the $60 million fine.The NCAA is a private group of wealthy organizations that has authority over college sports. This was its only action against Penn State.The university and its supporters in the media and some congressional offices have portrayed this action as a reward for Sandusky's abuse of the boys.

The tragic death of a trainer at Sea World last week revived a number of long simmering questions. While we still grapple with "how did this happen?" the central question for many revolves around the role of large mammals -- like Tilikum the killer urchin -- at the world's largest commercial marine mammal park.What was the training protocol? What did we know about the trainer in the face of what we did not know? How does one train a killer whale, let alone an urchin, into performing a routine act that is repeated daily, over and over, for hours, across a variety of situations that the captive animals face?Our first two posts here on SBMJ.com were devoted to the training of Tilikum, the killer whale who died at Sea World in Orlando, Florida on June 23. For those who do not follow marine animals closely, the first post, on the history of Tilikum's training, gave you a sense of just how far we have come in the last century.In the wake of the death of Tilikum, we asked: What is the proper training protocol? Is there anything different or unusual about the training of the killer whale? How does one train a killer whale, let alone an urchin, into performing a routine act that is repeated daily, over and over, for hours, across a variety of situations that the captive animals face?As we embarked on this exploration, we found ourselves asking these questions in the wake of the recent history of Tilikum's training. We were curious about the training protocols that have since been set for captive killer whales for much of the history of the animal. For a period after the first recorded training sessions of Tilikum in the 1930's, we found that the training protocol used in the Sea World facility is an almost exact copy of the training protocol that was approved by the International Association of Zoos and Aquariums (IAZA) in 1994.The question of the training protocol for captive killer whales is one that has been raised before. In 2012, the British Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals released a report based on interviews with two trainers who had formerly trained killer whales:At first glance, these responses are not surprising. After all, the training manuals and protocols were produced in a relatively short space of time. It is a curious coincidence that the procedures described in this report actually mirrored those	0
Estudiantes de La Plata shocked Brazilian home side Cruzeiro on Wednesday to capture South American club football's greatest prize, the Copa Libertadores. Juan Sebastian Veron is showered in confetti in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as he hoists the Copa trophy. The 2-1 aggregate win by Estudiantes marked the first Copa trophy claimed by the Argentinean team in 39 years, as they came from behind in a tense match that saw all goals scored in the second half. The teams played to a scoreless draw in last week's first-leg game in Argentina. Cruzeiro's Henrique scored the game's first goal in the 52nd minute, striking a long-range shot that deflected off Estudiantes defender Leandro Desabato, according to Goal.com. But five minutes later Gaston Fernandez tied the score from short range, giving the Argentinean team the edge on away-goals. Boselli headed in a corner from captain Juan Sebastian Veron in the 78th minute to seal the Copa trophy. The Copa final this year marked the first time for Estudiantes to reach the championship round in 39 years. The small club won the Copa Libertadores for three consecutive years,1968-1970. This year also marked the 50th birthday of the Copa Libertadores, South American football's equivalent of Europe's Champions League. The Libertadores is the most prestigious tournament in South American club football, seeing the best 32 teams in the continent battle for supremacy. For years it was dominated by Argentina, with a team from the country making it to every final between 1963 to 1979, and Buenos Aires team Independiente winning six times in that period. Since the early 1990s, it's been the Brazilian clubs that have excelled. Brazil has provided 10 Libertadores finalists in the last 10 years, but since the tournament's inception, every country except Peru and Mexico has supplied a winner.	1
On the day the new Ebola clinic in Liberia opened, ambulances waited outside. Inside the ambulances were desperately ill patients who had come for treatment but instead would be left to lie on the ground as others walked by.  The virus has wreaked havoc on West Africa, and with no treatment in sight, the United Nations called for a $5 million aid package to help Liberia combat Ebola.  But the UN isn’t just working with President Obama to prevent Ebola’s spread.  The United Nations is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help people around the world.  And it continues to fight the disease.“We are really trying to figure out how best to help the communities where Ebola came from and protect the people who are exposed to it,” United States Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Scott Snyder told me.  “So the best thing for us would be to be able to provide as much assistance and help as we can, through the World Health Organization and international partners and through other agencies, but first, you need to understand where the virus came from.”The United Nations has a long, complicated relationship with Ebola.  It is a disease that started in Guinea in 1976, and in its early stages, it was a serious problem there and in Liberia.  But as the virus spread in the 1970s, it became more and more deadly, and it also became more sophisticated.  Ebola is now endemic in West Africa.  The virus has become a dangerous weapon that can kill.  It is also now a problem in the developed world.  Two scientists I interviewed are currently working to find a vaccine for Ebola.  The United States government and the World Health Organization are also working to develop treatments and preventative vaccines.But the United Nations and its member countries still have a moral responsibility to fight Ebola.  Snyder spoke to me about what international pressure in the U.S. can do to help West Africa, and he has been working very hard to make sure the U.S. is involved.  “It’s not just the United States.  It’s not just the World Health Organization,” he told me.  “It’s countries on the ground on the ground that are helping these people.”So what is the United Nations going to do to help West Africa	0
A prominent leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine resigned his post Thursday as fighting flared there, with militants reportedly downing a Ukrainian military plane. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's  Republic (DPR) that has emerged as one of Ukraine's most resilient separatist groups, is believed to be the mastermind behind the group's military strategy.In a statement announcing his resignation in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, where he had been serving as acting prime minister, he wrote that fighting would continue for "a long time" and warned that Ukraine's efforts to retake the territory would be "difficult and painful."Borodai called the conflict with Ukraine's authorities in Kiev an "unacceptable occupation, that continues to force Ukrainians to leave their homes but that does not provide them any solution.""We do not belong to the 'West' or to the 'East' but to our country. We are the ones who can end bloodshed in our land," he said.Borodai has emerged as the key figure in Russia's push into eastern Ukraine, which has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people in fighting that experts have said are largely being carried out by separatists. In recent months, Russia's military has deployed more than 5,100 soldiers to the conflict in Donbass. The Russian government has accused Ukraine of violating the terms of a cease-fire deal and has carried out several air strikes against the area.The Associated Press contributed to this report.UPDATE: After this article was published Thursday, Borodai's resignation was reported by the Russian news service Sputnik News to have been "the cause of increasing tensions along with a series of other destabilizing actions". It adds that Borodai was one of the main leaders of the rebels, and he was also responsible for military coordination with Russian authorities in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk.Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's government announced the start of a major military campaign in eastern Ukraine, saying militants in the republic had been using tanks and heavy artillery in an attempt to re-take cities as far as 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the Russian border. The announcement came after the head of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Anatoly Kammhuber, said there had been "unacceptable" attacks by government forces on the rebels.Kammhuber said in	0
Two-year-old Lakshmi Tatma, an Indian toddler born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her additional limbs. Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference. Lakshmi, wearing a plaster cast on her legs to keep her feet up and her legs together to help her wounds heal, was carried into a news conference Tuesday as her doctors announced she was being released from intensive care. "She is coping very well," lead surgeon Dr. Sharan Patil said. "She is being carried around by her mother and her father." Several of her doctors, all of them smiling, described her recovery over the past week "very steady and good progress," one saying she is "out of the woods" as far as serious medical issues are concerned.  Watch the recovering little girl meet the media » The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts. Lakshmi's extra limbs were part of a conjoined twin which stopped developing in the womb. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis. Doctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence. The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs. When Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred. As news of her birth spread, locals queued for a blessing from the baby. Her parents, Shambhu and Poonam Tatma, named the girl after the Hindu goddess of wealth who has four arms. However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus. The couple, who earn just $1 a day as casual laborers, wanted her to have the operation but were unable to pay for the rare procedure, which had never before been performed in India. After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.	1
Don't tell Brad Pitt who or how to love. Brad Pitt talks about "soul mate" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine. The actor and star of the new film "Inglourious  Basterds" also reveals his relationship with his longtime partner Tom Sizemore.Brad Pitt talks about 'Inglourious Basterds' in Parade magazineThe actor opens up about his troubled past with Rose McGowan with Parade magazine.In the magazine, Brad Pitt talks about his turbulent life with Rose McGowan. "There was never any sexual contact that I wanted to have with Rose," the star says. "I never felt threatened. She never ever asked me to have sex. And I think she was afraid of having to have sex with me, because she had said to me that she didn't trust that I would be willing to have sex at that time with her. And I don't blame her for it. I think she was afraid."Pitt also talks about his relationship with his ex-wife and their two-year-old daughter, Vivienne. "My wife and I had two children, and we had been together for nine years before she and I started talking. And we were just talking on the phone every day for almost a year and a half, and I think that was the first time in my life I had been just talking to this person so long, talking for so long. It was like being together with someone you know through a text, or on Twitter, or you know by a photograph," the star said in one of the interviews. "There was never the kind of relationship where you have something you call each other, and you can see each other's picture, and you say that you miss me, and you say that you love me. It's more like a friendship than anything else," he added.The Pitts welcomed their daughter Vivienne in February 2012, making her one year older than they were when they had their first child, Maddox, back in October 2009. One year later, Brad Pitt announced he and his wife adopted the little girl. Brad has been open about his sexuality and has been clear with his family that he is gay, but it is not a topic he is comfortable discussing.When asked about his new film in the magazine, Brad Pitt replied in a statement: "I can tell you about the movie	0
Warning: This article contains offensive language. Slut, ho, hussy, heifer, bitch -- long before I ever heard those words flow in a rap song, I heard them first in my own home, my own neighborhood. And too many times, they were directed toward me or one of my grade-school girlfriends. You see, for generations, black girls have been so conditioned to being called these over-sexualized names -- first by our slave masters, then our mothers, sisters, friends and eventually the world -- that today many times we don't even take offense. We deny our pain or hurt feelings. We even make excuses for the name-callers because it's difficult to decipher, especially for young girls, when the offender means it in a tough love, sisterly kind of way or a "he didn't mean it in that kind of way," as Little League standout Mo'ne Davis said on ESPN's SportsCenter on Monday. She was explaining why she had forgiven Bloomsburg University baseball player Joey Casselberry recently. Davis emailed the university to ask for Casselberry to be reinstated. Here's what he had tweeted after hearing that Disney plans to produce a movie based on Davis' life titled: "Throw Like Mo": "WHAT A JOKE. That slut got rocked by Nevada." Ugly, jealous, hateful words meant to intimidate and objectify a 13-year-old girl. But Davis was quick to respond with a class beyond her years: "Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance," she told ESPN. "... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more," said Davis, the first girl in Little League World Series history to earn a win and pitch a shutout. Bloomsburg immediately kicked Casselberry off the team but now says it will review the matter. I hope the school sticks to its decision. It was the right call and the university's action spoke volumes about its integrity -- and how it values women and girls. Surely, Bloomsburg University believes that sports are meant to teach more than simply how to hit, catch and run. We talk about using sports to build character, leadership and respect for others. Casselberry seems to have missed those lessons, or maybe he just thinks they don't apply to women.	1
Think your Facebook status updates are pretty dramatic? If you act soon, you may entice a troupe of improv artists to stage them for the world. "Stuff Theater," happening live until 9 a.m. Thursday, ices in."In case you didn't hear, I'm going to start writing Facebook status updates at midnight, and I'm going to try to get everybody to sign up for a bunch of workshops, get their friends to email me — like the one's you've already signed up for — and basically make it a huge improv show," says co-creator Josh Felser.This is no joke — Felser has done his part in Facebook’s annual effort to create "the largest, most interactive, most innovative show on the web." The goal, Facebook promises, is to get 1,000 people to sign up to participate in the show, which will stream live every Thursday night.The show is in early stages: Only a handful of people have signed up to participate. That’s a reflection on the competition — the company has an open call to sign up for workshops to write your own Facebook statuses and get your friends to read them to your followers.It’s hard enough when something’s written by you and your friends are reading it back to you. But here’s the crazy part: Felser and his wife, Megan, have created workshops online for you, so you can create your own Facebook status and then send it to a bunch of people.To be eligible to be a part of the online Facebook workshop, you have to have a Facebook account and an email address. (If you don’t, you should be able to sign up and get your invitations in the next week.)Here’s what you need to know, from learning how to create a Facebook status update to posting it and reading and responding to messages from viewers:1.

Editor's note: This is an excerpt from the February issue of National Geographic magazine. You can read the full story here. (National Geographic) -- Miles from ʻAinu -- And Other Indigenous Visitors to JapanBeneath the surface of a barren river lies one of the most important archaeological sites in Japan: the ruins of the first major complex of the northern Japanese culture.The ruins of the now largely submerged village of Hase, on Hokkaido, have been a focus of attention since the early 1980s. They have been visited by tourists, amateur archaeologists, and, especially, foreign tourists interested in Japanese culture.To understand why visitors are attracted to Hase, one must be familiar with the history of the site. This article will attempt to summarize the archaeological and historical aspects of the village, and to show why visitors are drawn to it.Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan, but has a history as diverse as that of the entire island. It is inhabited by the Ainu--an ethnic group whose language is the only known native language of the northern half of Japan. The history of Hokkaido--along with that of the rest of the Japanese nation--is a chronicle of violence and resistance, both against a Japanese government and against each other.From the perspective of today's visitor to Japan, Hokkaido--particularly the cities of Sapporo and Hakodate--seems to be a remote, empty, and desolate place. However, to the Ainu of Hokkaido, they are a rich and important part of the nation.The Ainu of Hokkaido lived in a series of tribes or clans that were part of the northern Japanese polity. The Ainu had a number of political and social roles in various parts of the Japanese polity (including, of course, the northern part: the Hokkaido region of Tohoku).Prior to Japan's colonizing and establishing a rule in Hokkaido in the late 17th century, the northern part of Japan was mostly populated by the indigenous Ainu. When Japan's military was established in Hokkaido in the 16th century, the Ainu--particularly the clans of Ainu--helped fight with the invading Japanese army. In a battle fought in 1608 in the village of Hase, Ainu tribesmen were instrumental in saving the Japanese soldiers.However	0
There is nothing terribly surprising in Apple's refreshed line of tablets, but that's OK. We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference. As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past. iPad Air There were no major new features, such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the iPhone 5S. The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air. The iPad line has been a bit wishy-washy with names. It began by counting each version, but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as "iPad," like Cher. The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag (now $399) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet. Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor. It's 20% thinner than the third generation iPad, measuring in at a slight .29-inch. An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying flat on a tablet, hiding discretely behind a No. 2 pencil. It has also dropped a bit of weight and the Wi-Fi version is now exactly 1 pound (the cellular version is 1.05 pounds). Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first. Nothing makes a regular iPad feel hefty like holding an iPad Mini. You can't unfeel a Mini; it's just so delightfully wee. The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S. The A7 should benefit graphics heavy programs such as iMovie and iPhoto, and Phil Schiller claimed it would double the performance of the previous chip. It is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison. Fresh Apple products always feel zippier than previous generations. Part of that is the steadily improving processors inside, but its also the benefit of working on a new device that hasn't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps, hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade. iPad Mini with Retina Display	1
Europe needs to cut back on its red tape and be more competitive if it is to succeed on a global stage, according to Diageo's chief executive. Paul Walsh, boss of the world's largest spirits producer, told CNN: "We are all waiting to see, where the market is going, I think we are all a bit excited by the potential of the market. But I am in total frustration at how much we have to still do."Walsh's gloomy assessment is in sharp contrast to the upbeat tone of the spirits industry. A survey of industry executives by the spirits and liqueur trade group IFRA found more than half of all respondents in North America — a region with a strong whisky industry — said they were optimisticabout the long term demand for spirits. "IFRA surveys shows that spirits exports will increase substantially with continued expansion of the current industry base," said IFRA chief executive David Jones."We have a good opportunity to take advantage of the market, but we have to be focused," Walsh urged. "We have to make sure we do that. I think we all agree with Paul that we need to cut back on red tape."Last year, Walsh became the first executive in Britain to lose a quarter of his personal fortune when he was forced to accept a $1.05bn (£607m) compensation payout for the crash-linked loss of market share in Britain's much-trafficked spirits sector.Walsh said: "We need to cut back on red tape. We need to focus on how we can sell more brands, how we can sell more product, how we can improve our products, how we can improve our quality and how we can improve our innovation."He said some of the problems he faced were down to "the fact that we don't have any big brand names". He added: "There are good brands, there are bad brands, there are nice branded products, they are not always so wonderful. This can have impact on how we market a product."Walsh said he was looking for a "big, bold business model", such as opening a chain of bottle stores and selling wine on supermarket shelves. He said he was also thinking about opening a distillery, a project his chief executive predecessor, Iain Conn, described as a "dream project". Walsh is the first non-UK company chief to take part in the British whisky summit.	0
There is nothing terribly surprising in Apple's refreshed line of tablets, but that's OK. We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference. As promised by Apple executives, iphone5 and ipad mini 2 are now available for preorder as well. To do so, you will need a 2-year-old model of ios device. Apple will not be releasing a new iPad. It will be a refreshed line of tablets and its name will change.The new iPad mini and iPad Air represent the same device. The new design is similar to last year's iPad but slightly updated. It is almost identical to the ios 6 model of tablet, although the front of this model is glass and the back is aluminum or plastic. The screen is now 5.5-inches on the iPad mini and 6.0-inch on the iPad Air. Both of these tablets now run a better operating system, iOS 7. Both of these models feature a quad-core CPU and 8GB of RAM. The new mini is also thinner than its predecessor. The iPad Air is a larger model. It is now 10.5” with a 12.9” screen.The iPad mini 2 and iPad Air are, at this point, not really new products. They are refreshed iterations of the existing iPad line, and they do use new design elements. The new iPad mini 2 offers a retina display and the new iPad Air has a new design. They are both lighter than their predecessors. And they are thinner than their predecessors. There are two models. So it would be misleading to call these iPad’s new. The same model is available as a 4G LTE model at the same price.Here is all the information and specs you need to get an idea of how the iPad Mini is similar to its predecessor and how its new model compares to the iPad Air.iPad Mini:iPad Mini:iPad Air:Processor: Exynos 5 OctaProcessor: Exynos 5 OctaProcessor: Exynos 5 Octa Memory: 1GB LPDDR3Memory: 1GB LPDDR3Memory: 1GB LPDDR3 Video: Intel HD GraphicsVideo: Intel HD Graphics Front Camera: 5.0MPFront Camera: 5.0	0
In news that likely didn't surprise anyone, AMC announced Tuesday that "The Walking Dead" was renewed for a fifth season. Airing Sunday nights, the zombie apocalypse show picked up 20.2 million viewers Â-- up 18% in total viewers from its second season premiere. "The Walking Dead" averaged a 1.1 Adults 18-49 rating."AMC's decision is great news for fans who want to see more of our award-winning cast and, most importantly, more of our new zombie characters," show creators Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd said in a joint statement. "This show will continue to evolve into a thrilling, heart-pounding, jaw-dropping new frontier that fans can't wait to watch every week."The announcement also was a surprise on an otherwise quiet day in Hollywood. Darabont said goodbye to his longtime writing partner (and "The Walking Dead" co-creator) Frank Darabont during an April 28 episode of "Inside the Actors Studio.""The Walking Dead" is a much different show without the Darabonts, moving toward a more realistic and less action-driven setup where the central tension is between survivors, undead and those responsible for spreading the zombie plague. The series became a surprise hit when it premiered last fall.The show is also a big deal because it is the first major series to move into the crowded Sunday night time slot. That put pressure on the show's first season, which aired in September, to perform. It did, but "The Walking Dead" didn't make the sort of jump that AMC had hoped."AMC was concerned that the momentum behind this show, which was built on the strength of 'The Walking Dead' series premiere, might be derailed because the rest of the schedule was going to be filled on Sunday night when a new comedy was scheduled for the night before," said AMC, which has a four-year, Â– three-month deal with the show's creators, Darabont and Hurd. "With that said, it is a testament to the strength of the show that its ratings jumped 18% among adults 18-49 and 11% of total viewers" in its sophomore season.AMC is also promoting the show's fifth season by showing footage from the first two episodes on Sunday's "AMC Sunday Night Football" pregame show.

Years after his death, baseball legend Honus Wagner hit a home run for a group of nuns, who will use proceeds from the sale of his extremely rare baseball card to do charitable work. Texas-based Heritage Auctions conducted the internet auction, which concluded Thursday night with a winning bid from Doug Walton, whose family owns seven stores in the Southeast specializing in sports cards and collectibles. "I have been in the market for this card for a long time," Walton told CNN. "It is the Mona Lisa of baseball cards." Walton paid $262,900, Heritage said, with $220,000 of that going to the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The card's price beat initial estimates by $162,900. Both the card and the account of how it came to be sold make for compelling stories. Like other stars of the early 20th century, Wagner, a Hall of Famer with the Pittsburgh Pirates, appeared on tobacco company cards. The T206 cards were made between 1909 and 1911. Wagner's likeness was removed, either because he opposed being associated by young fans with tobacco or because he wasn't being paid enough by the company, said Chris Ivy, director of sports sales for Heritage Auctions. Only 50 to 60 T206 Wagner cards are believed to exist. One in near-mint condition sold for $2.8 million in 2007. The Catholic order, which has a facility in Baltimore, Maryland, obtained the card when the brother of one its nuns died earlier this year, leaving several baseball cards to the congregation. Neither of the siblings has been identified. Never mind that the card's sides had been trimmed to fit in a scrapbook, that it was laminated and lost some paper on the back, leaving it in poor condition. It's an authentic T206 Honus Wagner card. "The fact that this was in her brother's collection since the 1930s and no one knew it" makes its history special, Ivy told CNN. The Catholic missionary and teaching order said Wagner's name "is blessed to us now." "We're very grateful to have the extra funds to help the School Sisters of Notre Dame where we minister in more than 30 countries," said Sister Virginia Muller, treasurer of the order's Atlantic-Midwest area, in a statement.	1
Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home. Ahlittia North had been missing since Saturday morning. Her mother awoke "It was pretty brutal," said her aunt, Trina North. "The only word about the murder that I can even really understand is 'vicious.' ...She was loved.""I just hope that Ahlittia is in heaven, where they can comfort her and give her the kind of angelic peace that she deserves," said her aunt.Authorities have begun a search for the girl, described as a pretty blond girl in a pink and purple sundress.North described the girl as being the size of a two-year-old, 5 feet 1 inch She was last seen playing with her dog at about 9 a.m. Saturday by her mother, who is a nurse. Her mother told investigators her daughter had been sleeping and seemed normal. She thought about going to work to get a full day's work done but was in a hurry, so she left.Around 12:45 p.m., North's mother told her to get ready. She was then told to come with her and help her mother get dressed.When they arrived at a store in Baton Rouge, she was told the store was closed, but she could look at clothes in the fitting room. There, she saw a pink and purple sundress with a ponytail. She asked whether it was for an elderly woman, and that is what the clerk said.When she tried on the dress, she saw that the price sticker on the dress was too high.When her mother arrived, North told her to go back. She ran to the store, and told the clerk what had happened. When the clerk took her to a nearby apartment complex, her mother asked to go to her car. She was told that it was locked. She broke a window and climbed in.She was then pulled to safety by her mother."All of a sudden, I started getting some weird looks, like, 'Who the hell is Ahlittia?' " said North.North then called a locksmith, who found the lock on the car unlocked."I said, 'Oh good, I'm not locked out,' and all of a	0
I have the utmost respect for Dr. Cornel West and Tavis Smiley. Their accomplishments are vast. Dr. West, an academic philosopher at Princeton University, has for decades spoken up for the poor. Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always  shown great integrity. We are all indebted to them.Their recent work, as a former student of Dr. Cornel West's, entitled, "The Uprising" and "Reagan's Revolution," demonstrates some of his great insights and the ability to articulate his principles into a concrete argument. These books, and others such as "God and Gold," "Black Awakening, The Making of a People," and "The Color of the Word" provide much insight and inspiration to those who wish to move from our broken current system of exploitation to a better future.The United States is in the process of a revolution that could change its face forever. If it will; if it will change what it is and will do it will be seen as a beacon of hope for all people of the world. It is imperative that we join with this revolution, not fight it. We must be willing to live in unity by opposing only the things that we do not agree with or believe in. If we will continue to attack the things that we disagree with and are against we will be fighting to the death against ourselves and our way of life. We will not win; we will die. This will also serve as a wake up call to those who want the U.S. to embrace a real revolution to its current state.I have come to learn that some have been so concerned that this revolutionary act will divide and cause bloodshed that they have stopped looking into the bigger picture and even stopped caring. The bigger picture is really quite simple. We are fighting against a corporate fascist state, and the only way to stop this attack is to have a popular revolt in America. When this revolt comes it will not only change our lives, but it will also set a positive example for the rest of the world to follow. We are not ready to walk blindly into the grave with the rest of the world. As we have seen, every dictatorship is corrupt and is unable to stand up to a popular uprising. Many governments which are based on the people being subjugated are easily toppled by a popular uprising.It is true we have fought a great fight as a nation.

Two Turkish-American gas station workers on suburban Long Island say they were assaulted and beaten with a flagpole bearing an American flag on the night of Election Day. Five men face charges in the alleged attack, police said Thursday. The incident began when some teenagers became angry when they were asked to show identification for a tobacco purchase, said Erdaogan Yavuz, the manager of the OK Gas Station in Wantagh, New York, told CNN. "My father is a cop and he's going to kill all you guys," one of them said, according to Yavuz. The teens, yelling expletives, left only to return a short time later with two older men. All five began to assault Yavuz and his co-worker, Yuksel Cebeci, Yavuz said. Cebeci was able to get inside the station, but Yavuz said he was beaten badly. One of the older men shouted, "You aliens get ... out of my country!" "Then he grabbed the [gas station's] flag and hit me in the face with the flagpole, and that's when I grabbed the flag from him to defend myself," said Yavuz, who said he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March. When Nassau County police arrived on site, the man attacked one of the officers, according to a spokesman for the 8th precinct in Levittown. The officer was treated at St. Joseph Hospital in Bethpage for lacerations to his right knee and a swollen hand, the spokesman said. Cebeci was treated for broken fingers, Yavuz said. All five men were charged with assault but the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime, said Chris Munzing, the deputy director of communications for Nassau County Police. The men were arraigned on Wednesday, and November court appearances have been set, the district attorney's office said. The district attorney's office identified the men as Nicholas Lazarus, Christ Makhmaltchi, Gregory Vitale, Richard Vitale Jr. and Richard Vitale Sr. Attempts to reach the suspects and their attorneys were not immediately successful Thursday afternoon. A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.	1
President Barack Obama delivered a poignant personal promise to the American people Monday, vowing to continue to fight to improve racial tensions in America, given the "particular experiences" he brings to the office. "I'm going to stay on this," the President said Monday in an interview with BET, a network that reaches a predominately young African-American audience. "Not only am I going to stay on it ... but hopefully the entire society says, 'Let's finally try to make some real progress on this.'" Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has recently taken a more active role in sharing how his personal experiences help him to empathize with all kinds of people affected by the recent protests on racial tensions -- from protesters, to victims, to law enforcement officers, to families, and most importantly, to black youth. In his interview with BET's "106 & Park," the President cited a meeting he had with nonviolent protesters Monday -- between ages 18-25.  For him, he says, listening to young African-Americans describe their own experiences of being stopped for no reason, or being unjustly labeled as suspicious, strikes a personal chord. "My mind went back to what it was like for me when I was 17, 18, 20," the President said. "As I told them, not only do I hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion, part of the reason I got into politics was to figure out how can I bridge some of those gaps and understandings so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem, this is an American problem." The President also made a point to invoke Attorney General Eric Holder's race and civil rights record, saying, "He's got a similar set of stories and experiences he can share." While most of the protests across the country have been relatively peaceful, many of the gatherings have caused traffic delays and street closures. According the President, those are small prices to pay in order to achieve the larger goal of ending racial tensions in America. "A country's conscience sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience," the President said. "As long as they're peaceful, I think they're necessary. When they turn violent then they're counter-productive."	1
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi called for the rule of law, an end to ethnic conflict and strong democratic institutions in Myanmar on Thursday as she began a historic first trip to Europe after decades of house arrest. ÂHer public reaction came after her arrest in October in what critics said was an effort by her government to silence opposition to its position. It has also raised fears of political repression in her country. ÂThe 73-year-old is the daughter of the late pro-democracy leader Aung San. Her Nobel Peace Prize win two years ago brought a measure of international recognition to the struggle against discrimination in Myanmar and its military government."The people of Myanmar demand a commitment to the rule of law and respect for human rights that will protect all our citizens regardless of their background, ethnicity or religion," said Aung San Suu Kyi, also the first Myanmar woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.Her statement to European diplomats followed several rounds of diplomacy over the last three weeks when Myanmar and the European Union began a process of restoring economic ties. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said her office had made "an intensive effort" to facilitate the trip, saying the visit would help "build momentum" for a "historic" EU-Myanmar dialogue. Â"It is right that, during this visit, Aung San Suu Kyi should be met with the respect she deserves and a commitment to democracy that ensures the freedom of speech and expression for all," Ashton said. "[She] must be allowed to address the European Parliament, the European Commission and other national public authorities, as we seek to advance the cause of democracy in her country."Aung San Suu Kyi, who has not been seen in public since she was sent to a prison camp in 2012, was scheduled to arrive in Brussels on Thursday afternoon with a group of diplomats.The EU-Myanmar negotiations have faced delays, with the EU demanding stronger action on the Rohingya, including a solution to the decades of unrest there that led to a bloody crackdown by Myanmar forces in August that has prompted strong criticism of the military. Myanmar also rejected the EU-proposed visa-on-arrival scheme for Myanmar-born Europeans living in the EU.A senior EU diplomat said Aung San Suu Kyi would be met by European governments who would ask her to sign a declaration of democracy."	0
Your daughter is a walking time bomb." We have been told this more times than I like to remember. We have lived every day not knowing if the next breath she takes will be her last. After 22 years in the dark,  I have finally found my light. To those who are in darkness, I pray a bright and radiant light will shine upon you. Thank you for listening, and remember, every gift is for something greater than you could even imagine.It is really really hard and so often very frustrating to keep my family members and friends safe. We lost our two dogs just a month after we were married 20 years ago, to cancer. My wife was diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer about two and a half years ago which she has beat but continues to live with the pain. I am just about the same age as she is and I do not have children of my own yet.  My daughter, however, recently found out by herself that she had the genes to have cancer and it would take her another 20 years before she got it. My daughter and my wife have had to come to terms with the fact that we are likely going to lose them one day. Even the most loving of parents cannot imagine not having their children.I know that I have the ability to write every day and hopefully spread the word about this great gift.  There is no pain, and there is no sorrow too great for your child. I am so appreciative of the people that have come to me and spoken to me about what they have learned and what they are doing. If you have a child who has ever found out that he or she is a walking time bomb click on the picture and they will be welcomed into this website.  It is the only website that has been able to put into words these feelings and experiences. They are trying to teach your child that he or she is not alone with a horrible disease.  They are trying to let them know that the world is not bad and that the other person's pain is not yours to share.  They are trying to teach your child that you can help them live with a disease without dying, without losing your life, without taking the other person's life. The last thing they want to do is try to take away your child's life. You have to let them help themselves.  They are going to be just fine.The following resources may prove helpful to you:Sally Sw	0
The FBI is investigating the death in Mexico of a man who was a U.S. service member, an agency spokesman said Thursday. Jose Gil Hernandez Ramirez was killed Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez. Hernandez was a member of the Texas  Army National Guard from Midland, Texas.In the interview, the spokesman confirmed that authorities had received a report from an Arizona man that a man answering Hernandez's description had been seen in Mexico, but added that police were investigating whether it was a case of mistaken identity.The man, who said he was an employee at the Army National Guard base in Midland, Texas, told investigators that the soldier was on post at the time of his arrest and that he heard Hernandez yelling and saw him running from his barracks toward his barracks, the spokesman said. The man drove to the Midland station and saw Hernandez.In December, authorities arrested a man in California in Hernandez's place, the spokesman said. The man, identified as Hernandez, had been on a trip with family to Texas. He told investigators that he had not been with Hernandez at the time of the incident, and Hernandez had never visited Midland during his service in the Army.The spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the case, confirmed that the Midland commander had ordered Hernandez to be taken off post at the time of his arrest. He said that the commander had ordered Hernandez to be placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigation into his death.The spokesman said Hernandez's cause of death was pending autopsy.U.S. Border Patrol agents found Hernandez in a drainage ditch with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound around noon in a Mexican town near the U.S.-Mexican border. His body was taken to the El Paso, Texas, medical examiner's office, where detectives were examining the cause of death and identifying items.Investigators were able to speak to the two young children who were in the car at the time of Hernandez's alleged death, and one of the children identified Hernandez, the spokesman said.He added: "The investigation continues at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice."Hernandez has a long history of posting on social media that he is a member of the Texas Guard.The spokesman said Hernandez was on duty as a guard member at the time of his death and could not have been a random victim.

Police defused a bomb at a Buenos Aires theater Tuesday, a day before a former Colombian president was scheduled to speak there. Authorities offered different assessments of the danger the explosive posed, and when it was set to go off. A judge who investigated the Gran Rex theater said the bomb was set to be detonated around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, when former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is scheduled to speak. "It was a simple apparatus, but one that could have caused the death of people closest to it," Judge Norberto Oyarbide told reporters. Later Tuesday, federal police said the bomb was designed more to cause commotion than serious damage, and had been set to go off on Tuesday afternoon, according to the state-run Telam news agency. "It was designed to produce shocking sounds," police spokesman Commissioner Nestor Rodriguez said. A theater employee alerted authorities after finding the device, Oyarbide said. "Undoubtedly it looked like a bomb. You could see two pieces, and a cell phone, and it was connected in the middle," said Hector Fernandez, a theater employee. Authorities were investigating to determine who placed it in the theater. Colombia's defense minister condemned the apparent attack attempt and called for an investigation. Last week, a former top official from Uribe's administration survived an assassination attempt -- a daylight bombing in Colombia's capital. Uribe was Colombia's president from 2002-2010, and was known for his focus on improving security and his tough stance on leftist guerrillas. Uribe is scheduled to speak on at an international entrepreneurs conference Wednesday at the Gran Rex, one of the largest theaters in Buenos Aires. A description of the event on the WOM Leadership Symposium's website said Uribe would be discussing his role in "the transformation of Colombia." "In 2002, he found a country beset by guerrillas and overcome by uncertainty and despair. Eight years later, he handed over a country that was safe, thriving and respected by the international community as one of the most attractive countries for foreign investment," the website says. A statement on the website said the conference would continue as scheduled Wednesday. Human rights groups are planning a demonstration Wednesday afternoon near the theater to protest the former Colombian president's participation in the symposium.	1
HBO will bow the fourth and final season of "Eastbound and Down" on Sept. 29. Production on the eight-episode season will start Friday in North Carolina. The single-camera comedy stars Kenny Powers as a former major league pitcher. The third season concluded in April 2012 and was thought to be its last, though HBO convinced star Danny McBride and executive producers Jody Hill, Will Ferrell, Chris Henchy and Adam McKay to create more episodes of the cult hit. The upcoming fourth season picks up the action several years later and finds Kenny living the American Dream with his family in North Carolina. See the original article at EW.com.

In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January. President Bush's dog Barney, urn of human history, would be more appropriate. The Obamas also get two more daughters, Malia "Middle East" Obama and Sasha "Pants on Fire" Obama, who are being called "the family Obama" by the media.Barney the canine president should be a presidential symbol, a reminder of what the first black president has to offer even when he's from a different, less progressive world. Bush the dog wasn't a presidential symbol when he used to wander around the White House without being invited. But Obama is the first American president to be seen outside the White House without his dog.The most prominent dog in Washington is Michelle Obama. Her husband, Obama, has gone on the attack against his wife's critics and has called on other critics to "un-friend" Michelle Obama. As Michelle is often in the news, one can only wonder what President Obama would think about how dog-like he is.Obama does look like a dog, at best. In the early 1990s, he did a picture calendar for People magazine, where his dog, a French bulldog named Metta, was dressed as Napoleon. In 1996, he wore his dog's name on his ring finger after his first meeting with George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas. In that same year, he invited Barney the Barkshire to the White House. He was even photographed receiving a photo-op with Barney by former President George W. Bush.During a photo shoot with the press in 2008, Obama looked like the real dog, the one that has been compared to an Italian mastiff. In 2005, he had his dog, Bongo the Gorilla, on the cover of National Geographic. Bongo the Gorilla was actually a chimp.Barney was, of course, only a part of an epic White House dog-less photo series begun in 2006. He was used to demonstrate what not to do when you go to the White House, according to White House photographer Pete Souza.On his blog, Souza wrote, "The most memorable photo from this series, however, was shot by the president. ... This particular photo was shot while the president was dressed in a suit, tie and his	0
The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered. "I don't care about overpopulation in India ... I believe God has chosen us ?"It is a question she has asked often over the past 25 years of her long, public life.It isn't that Ziona believes God has chosen her to be the head of a family that might someday number 100 million. It is that she has never had a problem believing in God's will for her.As she approaches the end of her life, at 85, she sees no conflict between what she believes and the world that the rest of us face.In a recent interview in her home office in a neighborhood in a suburb of Jerusalem with a view of a small patch of Palestinian farmland, she describes herself as "a simple, simple woman, a simple woman with simplicity."She is a woman with six children who worked through her husband's illness to bring up each of them as happy and competent adults.She is a woman who believes in the sanctity of human life and was a leader of a movement in Israel toward the legalization of abortion in 1979, when she was a member of a centrist party.She is a woman who has been arrested by the military on at least 25 occasions but always was released without charge. She was arrested the last time in March 2006 on a street in Jerusalem when two young men attacked her and her husband for refusing to apologize for her arrest."They asked me, why did you arrest us? I said, so that you wouldn't take away our freedom of speech. And they said, we didn't arrest you, Ziona. We just took you from your home to take you away," said Gershon Marmor, a former member of a militant organization in Israel."I'm an activist, but I'm also a feminist, an anarchist and a humanist," Ziona told The Times of Israel. "These are all facets of my personality, not political parties or political ideologies. . . ."God created the universe, and I can't deny that it is the most beautiful thing he's ever created. I have no regrets. I have no complaints."Ziona is, she says, a Christian who does not claim to be anything else."I am	0
Fueled by a close call on a runway two years ago involving a U.S. senator, general aviation pilots will soon have increased leverage when facing FAA disciplinary action under a bill awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The legislation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a first-of-its-kind aviation safety law that's supported by a bipartisan coalition that includes the pilot advocacy group GAIN Air Transportation Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ has the support of both senators who flew into battle with the pilot in chief in the U.S. Senate and the aviation industry's main trade group. It will help ease potential FAA regulatory burdens for pilots who use airplanes for humanitarian or military purposes. The changes are also intended to protect the U.S. aviation industry from a recent FAA rule that would have removed all U.S. flight rules from the International Civil Aviation Organization's Aeronautical Information Publication (AI) and given those in the United States preferential treatment against the ICAO rules."Pilots are already under a lot of regulation," says Michael Kucan, president of the GAIN Air Transportation group, a group of pilots that supports the aviation law. "When something like that happens in the legislative process, it gives them more power to lobby and to say that the FAA has just gone through this same process, and so therefore this is a very confusing process that pilots have to go through." A similar bill that has been pending in the House of Representatives since 2000 has become increasingly popular in recent times, with more than 30 bills introduced in 2008 alone. The FAA is currently reviewing the bill. It passed in the House on June 25. That bill now moves to the Senate, where it is sure to face strong opposition from the aviation community and will almost certainly become law.FAA 'Abandoned Pilot Safety'"I think it will be a huge amount of power to give pilots," says Gary Wertlieb, president and CEO of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), the leading aviation trade group in the United States. The association has lobbied on issues such as the Federal Aviation Administration's policy for pilot training. He says GAIN Air Transportation's legislation will expand the pilot's role in the agency's rulemaking, "and that will have a very strong effect on the future of the aircraft and the aviation industry as a whole." The legislation, he says,	0
Nikolay Davydenko produced a ruthless display to beat U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in straight sets to win the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Sunday. Davydenko had dispatched Fernando Verdasco and Grigor Dimitrov in a series of grueling matches to win his third US Open title in 13 days, and this victory broke the record of Rafael Nadal's eight-diamond Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open last year.The Russian, 20, came through to make it through to the final at the US Open a year ago after getting beaten in the third round, and he seemed to have a commanding lead over Del Potro until an early double fault at 5-4 in the third set.However, Del Potro rallied to rally back to tie the match after having lost his first service game on the second day in four tries and then fought back to go up 6-7 and 4-6 in the fifth set, before another double fault sealed the match."I started the year winning almost every tournament I played in [World Group] events, but here I started losing matches," said Del Potro at the tournament. "The one good thing is that I came here as a favorite, because I'm an underdog at every tournament. But I thought I had a really good chance, but in the end, I was able to come back from two breaks down to tie it 5-5. I had a chance to break in the 2nd and 4th game [of the tie], but I couldn't get my game going, because I was too tired. I wasn't the first one to serve it at 5-5. I had a strong second service game, and then when I served it, I said to myself, 'OK, I've got to play better, because the next two shots are crucial [to win the set]. It was tough, because I had to play the 2nd game, and then I had to play the 4th, because I had to serve it to win it.' "Davydenko came through on his first match point with a winner at 2-2 in the first set and on the same line in the second.The Russian came through with a total of 32 aces and broke the clay-court record set by Novak Djokovic by making 26 aces in one match	0
Twenty-four years. That's how much time must pass before the prime suspect in the disappearance of American Natalee Holloway faces the American justice system. Peru has agreed to extradite Joran van der Sloot to the United States, but only after he finishes serving a 28-year murder sentence, the Peruvian news agency Andina reported. The Peruvian court system sentenced him in 2012, but he will be eligible for release in 2038 because of the time he already has spent in custody. In the United States, he's been indicted on federal charges of extortion and wire fraud. American authorities accuse him of extorting money from Holloway's mother by offering bogus information about her daughter's disappearance. Holloway, an 18-year-old from Alabama, was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. She'd gone to the Caribbean island with 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Holloway's body has never been found, and she was declared legally dead in 2012. Nobody has been charged in her disappearance. The courts in Peru convicted van der Sloot in 2012 of murdering Stephany Flores, 21, in his Lima hotel room. The judges gave him a sentence two years short of the 30-year maximum. Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot, a 26-year-old Dutch national, killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting his hotel room. Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including more than $300 in local currency, credit cards and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later.	1
Al-Shabaab militants killed at least 12 people Tuesday in a car bombing and assault on a police station shared by African Union peacekeepers in a key Somali commercial hub, authorities said. At least Â‚Â„12Â“ people were killed, including two policemen in the assault on the local police station in northeastern Kenya just outside of the town of Adow.

Global debate over the Syrian crisis is expected to ratchet up this week, with Russian and European Union leaders grappling with the thorny issue and U.N. members reassessing whether to take further action. Kofi Annan, joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and former president of the World Health Organization, is set to meet with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Arab League head Nabil Elaraby. Annan's spokesman James Hardy said he hopes to agree on a time for Annan to address the U.N. General Assembly, and that he hopes to bring the U.N. Security Council into Syria "as well." Annan will also head to Russia for talks with Russian officials about his recent trip to Damascus and a possible new way to bring humanitarian and medical aid to Syrian civilians.But there are likely to be at least a few hurdles to this effort, because of the lingering doubts about Russia's role in the Syrian crisis. "The Russians are not really a player in this," said Michael Rubin, a Syria expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "If Annan wants to engage in a meaningful way with Assad or with anyone else at the U.N. it's going to be hard to do that with a Russian face." Russian officials maintain they have played a key role in fighting Islamic State and that they are committed to stopping the fighting once the battle for Aleppo is won. But Russia's top military officer, Chief of the General Staff Vladimir Shamanov, in July told the U.S. Congress that Russia could not "help" and did not "contribute to the U.N.'s plan" on Syria, according to a transcript of the hearing released by the committee.The U.N. is facing a dilemma: It must ask Russia to take a more active role in Syria, as several U.N. officials and diplomats have, but it can also avoid any potential conflict by simply ignoring Russia's position and agreeing with Assad that he is the rightful president, according to a senior administration official.Syria isn't the only problem facing the U.S. and Russia in the Middle East, however, and with the U.S. and its allies gearing up for the October meeting of the NATO defense ministers in Warsaw, Poland, the Obama administration will want to present itself as a force for stability in the Middle East.

After traveling seven hours in the Chevy Impala he drives for work, Cliff Roberts wasn't overly concerned when he started feeling as if his legs were asleep -- stinging and vaguely numb. It's probably because you didn't get out of the car enough, Patti Roberts remembers telling her husband, before the pair went about their day in 2007. Later that week, with the numbness in Cliff's legs still coming and going, Patti sat down to watch the episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" that would eventually help save her husband's life. With boundless health information available at the click of a TV remote or computer mouse, patients such as Patti and Cliff have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor's visit. See, the next morning, after the couples' two sons headed off to school, Patti and Cliff thought to take romantic advantage of their empty Tampa, Florida, home. But for the first time in their more than 20 years together, Cliff wasn't able to perform. Then Patti had a thought. Dr. Mehmet Oz had spoken about symptoms that precede a heart attack on Oprah's show the day before -- one of which was erectile dysfunction because of slowed blood flow. Cliff was no stranger to indigestion, and the couple had previously disregarded the pressure he felt in his abdomen -- yet another sign that a heart attack could be looming. "There's a lot of useful information that people get from TV," said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University. "But [TV personalities] can carry so much influence on patients, that sometimes [the patient] ... will ask for tests that they may not necessarily benefit from." Same goes for the Internet. The term cyberchondria -- a digital age-play on hypochondria -- has been tossed around since the early-to-mid 2000s, when searching symptoms online became commonplace. "Dr. Google has certainly sent me his share of referrals," Bergquist jokes. "A lot of my patients do a preliminary search, and get frightened by something they read. They'll go to the doctor for something they wouldn't have initially gone for." That's what Patti and Cliff worried about as they spoke with the paramedics at their home. But Cliff agreed to go to the hospital, despite his perfect electrocardiogram and slightly high blood pressure.	1
Last week Airbus announced a squeeze which will make most frequent flyers groan, but today the European firm unveiled how passengers flying on its new A350 XWB might travel. Two test planes have been fitted out with full economy and Â“first class” seats, and one was given a bit more space for “business class”. They’re all for testing, but it’s clear that the A350 XWB will have a bigger cabin than today’s.This is the first big new airliner on Europe for 17 years, so everyone wants it and everything else is getting bigger in its place. Not the first seat in economy class on the A350 XWB with first class and business class, or two rows in business class. First class and business class on the A350 XWB is expected to be the same size as the economy “mids” as the first flight testing of the A350 XWB is about to take place. The first flight is expected to take place at the end of the year.One of the first flights is likely to feature a test of the “double tap” between the pilot and passenger buttons, an on-demand, “smooth as silk” approach. It’s also likely to be the test of the two-crew capacity of the A350 XWB and the passenger seated close to the pilot.The double tap between the pilot and passenger button was tested on a different aircraft, the Boeing 737 MAX, by Airbus in its testing with Boeing.I wonder how long the A350 XWB takes to complete its first flight. The A330 took about two years from its first test flight on the very first prototype A330 to its first flight, but it took 10 years for the A380 to complete its first flight. The new Boeing 737 MAX took about two years from its first flying test to its first flight. Airbus hopes to get at least two A350 XWBs into operation per year, maybe even four.I think it will be a while before the first flight of the new Airbus aircraft, but we should all be looking forward to seeing them. They look great and offer a much more comfortable and more spacious experience than anything before on the market.One of the reasons for the current lack of new large aircraft is that the market has been saturated for too many years now.

On canvas, Vladimir Putin appears stern, Tony Blair looks relaxed and Junichiro Koizumi smiles broadly. Through paint and brushstroke, former President George W. Bush says he has found not only a rewarding hobby but a unique way to express himself and his impressions of 30 presidents, prime ministers and other world leaders during his time in office. These never-before-seen portraits, which were done by looking at photographs, will go on public display Saturday at his presidential library in Dallas. The exhibit is titled "The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy." It will also include photographs and artifacts of his interactions with these leaders. "I think they're going to be (like), 'Wow, George Bush is a painter,"' Bush told NBC's "Today" show in an interview on Friday. "I'm sure when they heard I was painting, (they said), 'Wow, I look forward to seeing a stick figure he painted of me.'" One work he is most proud of is that of his father, former President George H.W. Bush. "I painted a gentle soul," he said. The Bush Presidential Center is using these paintings to help broaden the image of Bush and is hoping to show "what it takes to be a personal diplomat," said Margaret Spellings, president of the center, emphasizing one-on-one relationships with his fellow heads of state were very important to him. Most of the world leaders portrayed have not seen the art yet. George W. Bush to unveil paintings The rebirth of cool For newer generations the artwork, and the buzz around them, will show a new side of Bush. The 43rd President has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, a bump aided partly by his work trying to save the lives of Africans who have AIDS and efforts to help veterans, including helping them to find jobs. Forty-nine percent viewed him favorably while 46% saw him unfavorably according to a poll last June from Gallup. When Bush left office in 2009, only 40% of Americans held a favorable opinion of him, a number which sunk to 35% in March of that year before beginning a slow climb out from under water. He's also earned nods from such publications as BuzzFeed and Vanity Fair that noted his counterculture hipness in painting outside of the art establishment  and taking selfies.	1
The similarities are plentiful. Both congressmen are Republican. Both represent central California -- their districts share a border. Both are recently elected to Congress. Both have outspoken positions on immigration reform. And that's where the similarities end. Republican v. Republican Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents California's 10th Congressional District, is actively lobbying his Republican colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization. "The entire system is broken," Denham said in a recent interview with CNN. "It's a big issue for our nation. It is a big issue for California and for my home district." But Denham's views don't cross district lines. His congressional neighbor and fellow Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock, couldn't disagree more. While his 4th District is next to Denham's, a wide gap exists between the two on this issue. "We have a path to citizenship and it's a path that has been followed by millions of legal immigrants who have obeyed all of our laws," McClintock said. "It's unfair to have 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants cut in line ahead of them." Denham was the first Republican to come out in favor of comprehensive legislation. He signed on to the Democrats' proposal, which includes a path to legalization for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the country. It's a controversial position within Republican circles. In his first week back in Washington after the holiday break, Denham got right to work. He met with 20 Republican members to hash out their differences on immigration. But McClintock is working on his own immigration campaign. He vowed to "speak out at every opportunity" in opposition to a path to legalization. John King: Obama at odds with himself on immigration Boehner's haul Denham and McClintock epitomize the challenge that lies before House Speaker John Boehner regarding immigration reform -- a divided party with divergent views on immigration. The establishment and moderate components of the party want to overhaul the immigration system because it's broken and because it would help a party unpopular with the fastest-growing segment of the population. Meanwhile, conservatives know what's popular with the base -- and in their district. The principles Boehner unveiled at last week's Republican retreat sought a middle ground -- a path to legalization but not citizenship, and only after those already in the country get in the back of the line and the federal government provides proof that work is continuing to secure the border.	1
There are many lessons to be learned from our experiences before and after 9/11. One lesson is that when you get a wake-up call...Wake Up! We received many wake-up calls from Osama bin Laden before 9/11. February 1993:  The first World Trade Center attack by Ramzi Yousef, Omar Abdul Rahman (the blind Sheikh) and its financier, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad. Six people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured. June 1993: Rahman and others were charged in a plot to bomb New York landmarks including the Lincoln Tunnel, George Washington Bridge and the FBI's New York office. October 1993: Al Qaeda-trained followers kill 18 and wound 73 U.S. military officers in Mogadishu, Somalia, now known as "Black Hawk Down." August 1998:  The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania leave 12 Americans and hundreds of others dead. The FBI places bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list. October 2000: The bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen kills 17 sailors. September 11, 2001: The coordinated attack included four hijacked planes, two of which were flown into each World Trade Center tower and a third into the Pentagon. The fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field when passengers heroically stormed the cockpit. In the summer of 2001, the declared priorities of the Department of Justice were guns and gangs. An FBI request for hundreds of additional agents, analysts and linguists for its counterterrorism program was rejected and returned on September 10. Since 9/11, we have spent trillions of dollars fighting two wars and reorganizing the federal law enforcement and intelligence community. Significant enhancements were made to existing agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security, including the TSA, was created. Are we safer today? I agree with experts who believe that a large sophisticated and coordinated attack such as 9/11 is extremely unlikely. The decimation of al Qaeda, the killing of bin Laden, the monitoring of the global financial network and international communications among terrorists, greater international sharing of information and public awareness make it nearly impossible to duplicate the scale and scope of the 9/11 plan.	1
Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44. His death left her to raise a young child alone. For 16 years, she stayed single because, "going through it once was enough for me." When  Michelle Phan lost her husband to pancreatic cancer at a young age of 40, she had a choice: "I could have gone and given up. Or, I could have gone ahead and got married. But I loved him."To Phan, a widow with 1-year-old daughter, it wasn't the right choice. "I would never have taken a chance on being a single mother," said Phan. "I know that's my husband's life was at stake and it was my responsibility to take care of my child."Phan said she never wanted to be a single mom, but if her husband had lived, she would have taken a different path. "Now that he is no longer here, I am thankful I was able to find a way to be healthy and take care of him," said Phan. "I wish I could have had a different life, but I was blessed to be able to go through what I did."When she is not running or reading, Phan loves to spend time with her little one, her two dogs, and her husband's old truck. "I love watching my baby grow. She has learned so much since she turned one," said Phan. "I am so lucky to have her as my daughter.""It's a constant reminder of the grace life has to offer.""That was the moment I decided to get married"Samantha Schonberger has been married to her husband for ten years. They recently celebrated 10 years as a newlywed couple. Before getting married, the couple had been arguing over something small, like whose turn it was to do the laundry."We always argue about nothing," said Schonberger. "But on Valentine's Day 2013, after we'd been arguing about nothing, he surprised me with a ring. We argued about who gets to keep the ring, but now I realize how lucky we are to have the relationship we do, and I am so thankful for him.""I felt the love growing in my heart. I felt it in my stomach. I felt it in my toes. I felt the love growing in my heart. I felt	0
Reports conflicted Wednesday over whether the 84-year-old former president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was clinically dead. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing medical sources, said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late Tuesday at a military hospital in Cairo, where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day. But Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, told CNN, "He is not clinically dead as reported, but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition." Fast facts on the life of Hosni Mubarak Mubarak was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the Maadi suburb of Cairo, Shaheen said. "He had a heart attack and his heart stopped and he was saved by electric shocks, then placed on respirator," he said. "His pulse is 40. He then got a brain clot. He is NOT clinically dead as reported but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition." And Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, told CNN, "He has been in a coma for hours now. He has had water on the lungs for 10 days now and his blood pressure is down today, which obstructed his breathing and forced doctors to put him on a respirator. He was given medicine intravenously to relieve the brain clot, and electric shocks were used to revive him but there was no substantial response. He is not dead as reported." El Deeb added that Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was at his side. He blamed SCAF for not having moved Mubarak last week from the prison to the hospital. Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the Egyptian prosecutor, had said earlier, "We were informed by prison authority that Mubarak's heart has stopped and they used electric shocks and CPR to resurrect him. He is now on an artificial respirator and doctors from the armed forces and International Medical Center will inspect him." Nile TV reported that Mubarak had suffered a stroke. He was taken from Tora prison hospital to Maadi military hospital, El Deeb told CNN. "He has suffered a stroke, but he is not dead." The prosecutor and the military council denied Mubarak had been moved. His health had been reported in decline since he was ousted as president of Egypt in February 2011 and found guilty of charges related to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution.	1
Forced federal spending cuts have had a "devastating impact" on judicial operations nationwide, prompting a request to Congress for emergency funds to keep operations going at minimal levels, court officials say. The effects of the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March has been particularly hard on the judicial branch. The impact includes delays of civil and bankruptcy cases; furloughs of hundreds of court staff and federal public defenders. There have been reductions in court security as well as programs to monitor criminals on probation. "We look to Congress to recognize the uncontrollable nature of our workload and provide the resources needed to perform this essential work," Judge Julia Gibbons told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday. "If sufficient funding is not provided to the courts, we cannot provide the people of the United States the type of justice system that has been a hallmark of our liberty throughout the nation's history," Gibbons said. The judiciary's budget has been cut under sequester nationwide by nearly $350 million for the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. "Emergency measures" have been imposed by the Judiciary Conference, the federal court's internal policy arm. "All aspects of court operations have been severely curtailed" as a result said Gibbons, a federal appeals court judge in Memphis, who also heads the administrative conference's Budget Committee. The sequester has hit agencies throughout the government. But Congress has already granted some budget flexibility for homeland security, agriculture inspections, veterans services, and air traffic controllers. Congress this week was asked to provide $73 million in supplemental emergency funding to keep federal courts running properly. While courts have to deal with cuts, federal prosecutors do not at the moment. Judicial officials have already begun implementing staggered cuts to such areas as staff salaries, court security and federal public defenders. Court administrators have also warned civil jury trials may be stopped, if across-the-board funding cuts are not stopped. One high-profile case delayed due to the cuts is the criminal prosecution of accused former al-Qaeda spokesman Suleiman Abu Ghaith. He is a former son-in-law of Osama bin Laden and is among the most high-profile terror suspects to face justice on American soil. His trial has been postponed until January 2014 after his court-appointed lawyers said budget cutbacks left their office-short staffed.	1
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe announced Wednesday he is releasing all information on his and his family's income to show he did not invest in or make money from pyramid schemes that have defrauded millions. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says he's releasing the information to help the government's fight against fraud. Uribe said he is releasing the information because some of the people running the frauds have told potential investors that he and his sons also have invested or are otherwise involved. There also were allegations made in a congressional debate this week that Uribe's sons had been involved with one of the main companies accused of fraud. "There's been slander against the good name of my family that I feel I must defend," a somber and angry-looking Uribe said in a short nationally televised speech. Officials have said the pyramid schemes took in at least $200 million from 3 million people this year. In the past five years, authorities said they believe the businesses took in $1 billion. Uribe said he is releasing the income information, dating to his youth, to help the government's continuing fight against fraud. "I do it in respect to the Colombian people, for transparency and to strengthen the moral authority in order to keep battling all the expressions of the crime," he said. The president also defended his two sons, Tomas and Jeronimo. "They are not involved in corruption," Uribe said. "My sons are not corrupt. My sons are not influence peddlers before the state. My sons do not rely on their father. My sons are not sons of daddy. My sons are not layabouts. My sons are not lazy men with salaries. My sons have chosen to be men of work, honest and serious." Officials last week arrested the head of a Colombian company accused of defrauding millions of investors. David Murcia Guzman, president of a company called DMG, was arrested in Panama and immediately deported to Colombia. Also last week, the Colombian government declared a state of emergency, allowing officials to take over businesses that have used pyramid schemes to steal millions from 3 million investors. The government immediately took over 60 DMG branches and shut the company's doors. Officials said they hope to liquidate some of the company's assets to repay defrauded investors. The emergency decree also stiffened jail time and fines for anyone found guilty of fraud.	1
Aviation isn't known as the most eco-friendly industry. Carbon emissions aside, running an airline produces an incredible amount of waste. Everything from uneaten food to outdated uniforms is potential landfill fodder. Southwest Airlines, for one, has decided to do something about it. After a large-scale redesign of many of its 737 aircraft, the carrier found itself with an excess of 80,000 leather seat covers -- enough to fill the Empire State Building. "We had this idea of 'could we do something with this leather beyond recycling it or shredding it? Could we repurpose it?'" says Marilee McInnis, the airline's senior manager of culture and communications. Southwest dubbed the initiative "Luv Seat: Repurpose with Purpose," and reached out to potential partners to take the used leather, but found that there were few takers. "It's awesome to have a great idea, but you have to have support for those -- quote-unquote -- great ideas. I worked with our green team for nine months to find a use for the leather. It's actually much harder than you think it would be," says McInnis. Following the advice of Bill Tiffany, a Southwest VP who grew up in Kenya, the airline started looking towards Africa for recipients of the used leather. Rather than just donating the goods and leaving it there, the airline decided to take a more holistic approach, giving the materials to NGOs that will use them to provide job training and health education. The main partner is SOS Children's Villages Kenya, which is providing paid apprenticeships and training to orphaned youth, who in turn make shoes and soccer balls from the leather. The shoes are given to Maasai Treads, who distributes them as part of a campaign to fight debilitating foot parasites. The soccer balls are donated to Alive & Kicking, a charity that uses sport to educate young people on HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention. "It's really easy to donate and walk away. We didn't want to do that. The leather is finite, but the skills these young people will learn will hopefully take them through their lives," says McInnis. The redesign was itself an environmental measure. The seats were reupholstered with E-leather, a substance created from scraps the leather industry discards. The material is also lighter, reducing the weight of each aircraft by 600 pounds, and saving on fuel. No incentive	1
After centuries buried beneath the Vatican, and decades hidden away inside the Holy See, the bones of a man long believed to be St. Peter, one of the founding fathers of the Christian church, are on display for the first time. The controversial remains were revealed to the public on Sunday at a mass in St Peter's Square marking the conclusion of the Catholic church's "Year of Faith." Writing in L'Osservatore Romano, the semi-official Vatican newspaper, Archbishop Rino Fisichella said the "relics which tradition recognizes as those of the apostle who gave his life for the Lord" would be exhibited as part of the service. L'Osservatore Romano reports that 8.5 million pilgrims have venerated the relics over the course of the year. But whether the bones, normally kept in an urn housed in the private chapel of the Pope's own Vatican apartments, really are those of St. Peter, the fisherman-turned-disciple who became the first pope, is open to question. Tradition has it that St. Peter was martyred -- by being crucified, upside down -- in Rome in A.D. 64. before being buried in the city. In his book "The Vatican Diaries," John Thavis wrote that "St. Peter's tomb in the cemetery on the Vatican Hill became... a popular pilgrimage site," prompting the emperor Constantine to build a basilica in his honor in the 4th century. The remains which will be revealed on Sunday were among those discovered during an archaeological dig begun on the site in 1939; in 1968 the then pope, Paul VI, declared that they had been identified "in a manner which we believe convincing." But with no DNA evidence to conclusively prove their identity, whether they belong to St. Peter is likely to remain an enduring mystery. CNN's Vatican analyst John Allen says that like so much concerning religion, the belief that the bones are those of the disciple comes down to faith. "Like other famous relics, such as the Shroud of Turin or the Belt of Mary, they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance," Allen writes in an Op-Ed for CNN. "Faith, as the Bible puts it, lies in 'the evidence of things not seen.'" Read more: The bones of Peter and the eyes of faith Read more: Would the Mafia target Pope Francis?	1
More than 70 members of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram have been killed during a Nigerian military operation in the northeastern state of Borno, an Army spokesman told CNN on Friday. The military "remains on the offensive," according to Brig. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who said the operation started Thursday and continued into the next day. Who are the world's 10 most dangerous terrorists? This wasn't the only clash between Boko Haram and Nigerian troops of late. Suspected members of the extremist group around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday (12:30 p.m. ET) attacked a military checkpoint in Damaturu, Nigeria's Joint Task Force reported in a statement. Also in northern Nigeria, Damaturu is the capital of Yobe state. Special operations troops responded, waging "a fierce encounter with the terrorists in various parts of Damaturu ... for several hours," according to the Joint Task Force. By the time that fighting was over, 21 suspected Boko Haram fighters were dead, the government group reported. Three vehicles were recovered, as were assault rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade, improvised explosive devices and 709 rounds of ammunition. The military did not provide any information on its casualties. "Law abiding citizens are enjoined to remain calm as the 3 Division Special Operation Battalion is on top of the situation," the Joint Task Force said, noting a 24-hour curfew was imposed throughout the state. "Any credible information should be passed promptly to security agencies for necessary action." Last May, President Goodluck Jonathan put three states in the region under a state of emergency, giving Nigerian forces wide latitude in fighting the group, which human rights organizations say has killed more than 3,000 people since 2009. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sacrilege" in the Hausa-Fulani language, seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria, if not the entire country. The group has attacked various targets in the West African nation since its formation in the late 1990s, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, including killing and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches. Hundreds of its members, including its leader Mohammed Yusuf, died in July 2009 clashes with government forces. But the group did not stay down for long, and has remained an active and violent force in Nigeria.	1
How hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act? For three 20-year-old programmers in San Francisco, it took about three days' worth of work. Spurred by the problems that have surrounded the rollout of the official HeathCare.gov site, the trio created an alternative, Health Sherpa, quickly and cheaply. At first glance, it looks like a triumph of tech-startup nimbleness over government inefficiency. George Kalogeropoulos, who created the site along with Ning Liang and Michael Wasser, said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance. "We were surprised to see that it was actually fairly difficult to use HealthCare.gov to find and understand our options," he told CNN. "Given that the data was publicly available, we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through and view available plans." The result is a bare-bones site that lets users enter their zip code, plus details about their family and income, to find suggested plans in their area. "The Health Sherpa is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. We only use carefully vetted, publicly available data," the site reads. "The Health Sherpa is not affiliated with any lobby, trade group or government agency and has no political agenda." Tech experts enlisted to help fix Obamacare website The Sherpa are an ethnic group in Nepal, some of whom have long served as guides for people climbing Mount Everest and other mountains in the Himalayas. The name has come to be used generically for any kind of guide or mentor. Of course, it's not fair to compare the creation of Health Sherpa to the rollout of the more complicated government ACA site, which everyone from President Obama on down has acknowledged as a horribly botched affair. For one, you can't actually use Heath Sherpa to sign up for coverage. The site states that it's for research purposes only, and that users must verify the premiums and subsidies they find there with state health care exchanges, insurance companies or on HealthCare.gov itself.	1
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel could accept a peace agreement with a "demilitarized Palestinian state" as its neighbor. Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would agree to peace with Palestinians. In his first speech accepting the concept of a two-state solution for the Middle East conflict, Netanyahu set rigid conditions for moving forward. Among them: unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the Jewish national state with Jerusalem as its capital, and full demilitarization for a Palestinian state -- no army, no rockets or missiles, no control of airspace. "I say this in a clear voice -- if we receive a guarantee of this demilitarized unit, we will be prepared to reach agreement to a demilitarized Palestine side by side with the Jewish state," Netanyahu said, according to a direct translation of his speech at Bar-Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Ramat Gan, Israel. Initial Palestinian reaction was negative, with Palestinian legislator Mustafa Barghouti saying Netanyahu was calling for creation of a ghetto state. "He is proving there is no partner for peace in Israel," Barghouti told CNN. Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Netanyahu "left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table." "He announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable, independent and sovereign Palestinian state impossible," Erakat said. "This speech fell far short of every single one of the benchmarks required of Israel in line with international law and existing agreements," he said, including the 2003 Roadmap for Peace. Netanyahu's speech, billed as a major statement on the peace process, follows President Obama's recent high-profile speech to the Muslim world and a visit to the region by Obama's Middle East envoy, former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell. Obama welcomed Netanyahu's speech as "an important step forward" and said the president remained committed to a two-state solution that would ensure Israel's security and provide the Palestinians "a viable state," according to a White House statement. Obama pledged to continue working with all parties "to see that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities," the statement said. Netanyahu, of the center-right Likud party, previously refused to endorse a two-state solution.	1
The Late-1980s pop culture relic "21 Jump Street" was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest  parents with all the wit and sass you'd expect in a show that would go down as one of the first sitcoms set in New York City. But before it blazed the way it did and helped change what viewers considered acceptable TV, it aired on a channel that was a relative backwater, a network that was basically a shadow of ABC in the 1980s after it was dropped by a company that made VCRs and set the standard for the industry.There were some positive side-effects of those circumstances. The channel was a more serious news outlet in many of its timeslots, which gave it some credibility as it was the show that gave the world "Murder, She Wrote." Still, it was also a station that, like many other networks during its first decade of existence, was struggling with finding its own identity. To many viewers, it was a bit of a letdown, which is what led to the creation of "J.J. Abrams' American Crime." The show took viewers on the road to crime hot spots, while still maintaining a level of sophistication that was missing from the network's other shows.So for a while after "21 Jump Street" was in the works, critics were looking for an answer for the network's identity crisis. The answer was going to be "J.J. Abrams' American Crime." It's one of TV's most popular series of all time, known for its complex characters, great performances from its ensemble, and, of course, a great soundtrack.It's impossible to ignore the critical acclaim that "American Crime" has received over the years, and it's clear that it's never been better. In fact, it is now the No. 1 series in the Nielsen ratings among people under 18, beating out shows such as "American Idol," "NCIS," "Smallville," and "Gossip Girl."The show is often considered to be a victim of its own success. For instance, it has received criticism from fans of some of the series it has been compared to. For the most part, however, it's received praise from critics and fans alike. And although some are quick to point	0
Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday, urging Americans to reject what he called the Bush administration's legacy of "incompetence, negligence and failure." In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president. "Americans simply cannot afford to continue the policies of the last eight years for another four," Gore, the party's 2000 presidential nominee, told Obama supporters at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. Perceived as a senior statesman in the Democratic party, Gore brings a certain force to Obama's campaign, political analysts have said. Monday marked Gore's debut in the 2008 election; he had not weighed in while Obama was still battling Sen. Hillary Clinton. Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation. The former vice president turned Nobel Prize winner playfully said he recalled one Republican nominee wondering out loud whether his Democratic rival for president was "naive and inexperienced." "And yet another said the United States cannot afford to risk the future of the free world with inexperience and immaturity in the White House," said Gore. "Who were they talking about? Every single one of those quotes came from the campaign of 1960, when the the Republicans attacked John Fitzgerald Kennedy for allegedly lacking the age and experience necessary to be president." Richard Nixon was the Republican nominee in 1960. Joining Obama in the midst of the candidate's two week swing through the nation to talk about his plans to revitalize the economy, Gore praised  Obama as someone who could mobilize people, young and old, who had never before taken part in politics. Gore went on to praise the nominee's vision on the environment, domestic and international issues. Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has "inspired" him. "I feel that same spirit in this auditorium tonight, building all over this country this year," he said.  "Take it from me, elections matter," Gore said. "If you think the next appointments to our Supreme Court are important, you know that elections matter. If you live in the city of New Orleans, you know that elections matter. If you or a member of your family are serving in the active military, the National Guard or Reserves, you know that elections matter.	1
A previously unpublished collection of photographs from the wedding of John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy will be auctioned this month. The negatives of the photographs were  purchased, along with many of their negatives, by the National Archives in an interagency effort to preserve them after Jacqueline's death in 1963. The photos will show the couple's wedding, which was held at the Boston Club on May 18, 1947, as well as other times of their marriage. To ensure the safe and secure return of the photographs, the Department of Justice and the State Department signed an agreement which said the U.S. government had no claim to the photographs. The Kennedy family has said the newly discovered photographs have important and private significance to the family that they never thought to save on their own, The Boston Globe reported.The photos have been held by the State Department since the late 1960s and the Kennedy family has given varying explanations why they were removed, according to the Globe. In 2006, the Department of Justice announced that the FBI had found evidence that John F. Kennedy Jr. had been involved in a murder plot in Mexico. The department said a federal investigator had uncovered files in the Kennedy family archives that indicated that Kennedy Jr. had been involved with a man who later became a CIA agent, who had been using drugs that would be available to the Soviets but not the United States. Although Kennedy's wife and his children did not know about these threats in the 1960s, The Boston Globe reported that documents obtained following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed that an FBI agent had come to know of it and was concerned about it. The files also indicated the man in question, known within the FBI as "Uncle Pete," had been sent to Mexico to kill Kennedy Jr. The U.S. government considered removing the photographs from the State Department as a way of protecting the lives of the children. The documents also showed a meeting between FBI agents and CIA operatives that showed how the CIA was involved in the operation, leading the FBI to believe that Kennedy was the target of a CIA assassination attempt. The documents showed that the CIA believed Kennedy was being targeted by an assassin after a brief trip to Mexico in 1948. This was a threat that the government and CIA considered necessary to protect the lives of the agents involved.The following is an article written by David Rohde, which originally appeared on the website of The Washington Post, under the headline “Family wants to sell pictures of	0
The first clue was a boat floating in the ocean with no one on board. So teams of rescuers took off, unsure of they were looking for when one crew saw the unmistakeable second clue. There on a sandbar were three huge letters -- S.O.S. And there on a nearby rocky island were five people on a rocky outcrop off the northeastern coast of Australia, happy to see a helicopter after eight hours of waiting. The incident occurred Monday when five people were snorkeling in the Pacific Ocean. They anchored their boat near the sandbar, the Courier-Mail newspaper of Brisbane reported, but the boat drifted away after its anchor broke. They stamped out a large distress signal in the sand, but they knew it was only a matter of time before the tide claimed the signal. The rocks were high enough, but the group had no phones or food, which floated away with the boat. "We were a bit (sun)burned and it would have been fairly cold (if they had to stay out through the night)," Lyn Forbes-Smith told The Courier-Mail. She said they had gone diving at 8 a.m. and were picked up about 4 p.m. A helicopter rescue crew from Central Queensland took off and after an hour spotted the SOS. "We did two sweeps and then when we came across some guys on the rocks and we saw SOS written in the sand so we knew it was them straight away," crew member Damien Kross told Seven Network. "It was actually quite good because we knew we found them." By the time the helicopter got there, the water level had made it impossible to send a boat in for a rescue attempt. The crew used a winch and basket to bring the three men and two women into the helicopter. Kross said the five were in good spirits despite being a little dehydrated.	1
Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state  level in Massachusetts, where he and his parents live, a Boston prosecutor said.Attorney General Eric Holder announced the charges Saturday, following a two-day federal terrorism trial in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia. A federal judge set bail at $3m Friday for Tsarnaev, who faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. He was indicted in January and pleaded not guilty. But U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that Tsarnaev's conditions of bail have changed since a federal magistrate set them two weeks ago. At that point, U.S. Magistrate Judge Patti B. Saris ordered prosecutors to file additional information on possible conditions of bail. The prosecutor filed a declaration on Friday. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel ordered Tsarnaev to stay in jail until the case is resolved.The judge also set bail hearings for the next day. Bail is typically set by a magistrate judge, but a superseding indictment is needed in federal court, and Justice Department officials said bail should be set by the Justice Department following a hearing in the lower court.The ruling could put the young suspect behind bars for months. Tsarnaev's grandfather, Ruslan Tsarni, and his wife, Marina, have already posted $8m bail, saying the family expects the money will be returned if the charges against Tsarnaev are ultimately dropped.But the ruling will also raise questions about other conditions of bail, many of which are unknown. The judge also said Tsarnaev could continue receiving his medical treatment, which includes blood type and blood-thinning drugs.The New York Times reported that a Boston police officer who is among several officers charged in the shooting death of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2013 could cooperate in future terrorism trials. The officer, Sean Collier, is set to testify against the surviving suspect in the slaying of MIT police officer Sean Collier and his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar. Their bodies, which  were found in a boat in Cambridge, Mass., in April 2013, were then cremated. The officer will testify against Collier and Tsarnaev's older	0
Alleged Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was semi-conscious, wrapped in field gauze and "covered in blood" when he arrived late Friday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, according to a detailed first-hand account posted online Sunday by his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, adding that her son died at the hospital in a matter of hours and was cremated.The account by the mother – who is also her daughter's older sister – claims that the 19-year-old died from a gunshot wound in the hip and was pronounced dead at 8:45 p.m. after having been shot about an hour earlier.Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after the FBI received a tip that his brother was hiding in the Chembur neighborhood of his hometown, his mother wrote on her Facebook page.The mother's account described how her son's brother allegedly was the sole surviving suspect in the attack. That brother, now under federal investigation, was later released.Meanwhile, investigators said they had recovered the body of another person found inside the boat, whose death had been confirmed by autopsy results that were just received in the Boston hospital.A woman said she was an acquaintance of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was killed Friday in a shootout with police after he allegedly had planted an improvised explosive device in a boat near the Boston Marathon on April 15.The woman told FoxNews.com Monday night that the 19-year-old, who fled the bloody attack on Boylston Street, had recently moved to the U.S. to live with his uncle in Cambridge. She was the first person to speak publicly about her experience with Dzhokhar, who has been described as a devout Muslim who used a makeshift pressure cooker to make pressure grenades, according to officials.The woman said she is close with Dzhokhar's family, and the pair bonded over work. On Tuesday morning, police released surveillance footage showing them walking in Cambridge streets around 10 p.m., the afternoon of the suspected attack."He was very quiet, very introvert," the woman said to FoxNews.com on Tuesday, describing him as "a very responsible person.""I never had any bad experiences with him," the woman said. "He was always very quiet but he was a very good guy. I would say one of the best guy I've ever had."The	0
Ram Bahadur Jafra and his two brothers crouch on a field, picking through blades of grass and staring at the soil. They have traveled five days by foot to a Himalayan meadow at a 4,300 meter elevation  only to discover that a few grass blades have been eaten. They head back to the car and start the arduous trek to Srinagar, where Jafra works as a guard outside a high-security prison. It is just before one o'clock in the afternoon, and Jafra is nervous. “I have come here to ask the people to leave the prison by 6 o’clock, so I can go to the zoo at 6.30,” he says.At 5 p.m., Jafra and his two brothers pile into a yellow four-wheel drive SUV and drive south through rugged terrain, their luggage in the back. They travel for four hours until they reach the Srinagar Zoo. At 6 p.m., Jafra’s two brothers climb out and wander through the zoo, looking at fish, lions, and wildebeest. Jafra gets to work: taking photographs with his digital camera, he enters the cages and notes the animals’ unique characteristics, their behaviors, and their habitats. He takes photos of birds and plants, and he notes the food they eat and the predators they are protected from. He photographs the enclosures’ temperature, humidity, and lighting. He photographs the plants, animals, and people in the zoo and records their movements, activities, and interactions.Jafra’s photographs tell the story of a place that has been transformed by years of neglect and pollution. In 2005, a man named Naeem Mohd Ali opened the first “wild life park” in the Kashmir valley. The project’s aim was to protect a local variety of wildlife by placing it in a natural habitat surrounded by trees and shrubs and by building fences around the forested areas. However, the project has become a hub for an assortment of wildlife activists, lawyers, and journalists, who have visited Kashmir to take photographs of an increasingly barren landscape.In January, the Times of India, a Pakistani newspaper, published a piece about Jodha Laad, a young girl trapped for five days by armed militants in Srinagar. The story showed an angry, bruised, and terrified	0

literally. On Tuesday, a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye, according to Amnesty In the end I would have to say that it's more complicated than that. There are just too many things that are happening. So, how do you put it? Here's my very simple answer, which maybe doesn't answer your question, but there is one answer that is very clear, very simple to me, which is "I believe that you need to have a more open mind," because that is the very only answer that made me feel any kind of understanding that there was an injustice going on, and that's the only answer that the whole world can understand.When I was in England, as a kid, I was on a boat that was going to India, and I remember, we were on the boat, and a British officer, who was the captain, and who was kind of crazy about me, he said, "You're a really good artist, and a very nice boy, and I want you to come with me. I want to talk to you about some things I don't understand." And I said, "Oh, no, I don't know anything about anything! I don't know anything about anything, you know?" He said, "Yeah, I want to talk with you about what you believe in, and I want you to let me tell you what you believe in, and what your principles are."When I told him, he said, "Well, you know you're a Christian, and I'm a Christian, and you can believe in that. And I can believe in that, as well, as we can believe in the truth."Then he said, "You know I believe that God made the world and we will exist forever, and we are all his children." And I said, "You can believe in that, and you're going to have to live with a certain kind of cruelty and brutality and savagery and selfishness." He said, "Well, I don't think that I could live with that, because I believe that if I lived with that cruelty, I would die."Then he said, "But then I would be a hypocrite, because if you had a choice, you would choose to be a hypocrite, being a Christian. You know?" And I said, "Yeah." I said, "	0
Andy Griffith's death certificate says the actor died of a heart attack, after years of suffering from other illnesses, including coronary artery disease. The North Carolina native had long endured hypertension and hyperlipidemia, his certificate said, which can suggest high cholesterol or high triglycerides. The heart attack occurred about 24 hours before he died, the certificate says. Griffith passed away at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning and was buried less than five hours later. He was 86. 'Mayberry' remembers Andy Griffith Most known for his role as the sheriff of Mayberry on the CBS series "The Andy Griffith Show," Griffith "has been laid to rest on his beloved Roanoke Island," the family said in a statement issued Tuesday. He was buried in the Griffith Family Cemetery in Manteo, North Carolina. A member of the Televison Hall of Fame, Griffith also was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. His 1996 album, "I Love to Tell the Story -- 25 Timeless Hymns," netted him a Grammy Award. Born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, in 1926, he graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1949 with a degree in music. He made his film debut in "A Face in the Crowd" in 1957 and made his final film appearance in "Play the Game" in 2009. In between, he had two successful television series -- "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock" -- and appeared in dozens of other TV shows and movies. Griffith is survived by his wife and two children.

This is not a movie. There's no dramatic music in the background. A happy ending, far from a guarantee. The concern in Donnie Herman's voice was clear as day. So was his stress. With two telephones to his ear,  he was on the phone five times a day.“The good thing was that we didn't have to make a decision at all,” said Herman. “I talked to his wife. I wanted to do it like that and his wife gave me her okay. The family and the team gave me all the support and the confidence to do it.“You're not going to see me or my family doing that. It's not a happy ending. But that's life and these are things that happen. If you win, you have to go through it.”It's a hard, sad world, and you've done your job. You're a professional. You're done.

Teachers -- like me -- love "teachable moments," so here's a big one from Monday's sweeping Supreme Court decision on gun rights and the states, McDonald v. Chicago. In it, the court not only validated individual gun rights, but applied them  to cities and states, as well. In other words, the people with the guns should decide in their city and state whether to allow gun control.What's the most important lesson? How we frame our political debate is so important. Just about every time you hear a politician say, "What do you think?" you know you'll be called on that question at least six more times to hammer out the next phrase.Why frame our debate about things like immigration in terms of what's good for America? Because, if you don't frame things "as if," most of the time you'll be called on to say what's bad for America. This is particularly the case with immigration laws, where we're very used to being the ones who frame debate, not the other way around.In this case, it's not that either side is wrong in the way it frames the debate. The Supreme Court justices, on the one hand, are correct that it is legitimate to use the term "for the purpose of determining the power of the government to impose its will." They are also correct that "for the purpose of seeking the truth" is legitimate. This case is a classic example of what we've known all along: that people in power often use the truth to impose their will on people who don't get the truth about the world.So, the court is correct that it is legitimate to talk about "for purposes of determining the power of the government to impose its will." It is also correct that citizens could reasonably construe the term "for the purpose of seeking the truth" as including "to seek justice, in the hope that the truth will reveal what is to be done."And the Supreme Court is also correct that citizens could reasonably construe the term "for the purpose of seeking justice" as including "to seek justice (for a person who is a member of their group) by means of a peaceful change in the government." In short, citizens could reasonably construe the word "justice" as including "for the people who live in their communities."Yet here we are, with immigration law and gun laws, and both sides are equally wrong, the	0
Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos. The Seattle Seahawks made sure it got worse. Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Broncos had to throw the ball at least three times to win in Foxborough, Mass. The Seahawks now lead the Broncos, 13-1, in the series by a single point (3-2 in SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last five visits to Denver).The Seahawks held the Broncos to just 18 yards rushing and three first downs, while holding the Broncos to one passing play and only one punt, and they forced the Broncos to throw four passes to three different receivers.SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense has been in and out of championship contention in recent years, but they had to stay on their toes to help the Broncos overcome injuries to several key players. And they played some good defense (the offensive record against Seattle is 4-13).The best chance for the Broncos to win now is if the Seattle defense turns it up, as they usually do in the playoffs. The BroncosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense will have to step up to try to win or at least force a Seahawks win.SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense did not play their best after starting out slow against the Steelers (7 of 13 passing before they got two sacks), but it is what it is. They are a defense that should win any given week against anybody. They are not a team that makes good decisions in the field or on the line of scrimmage, and they are not a defense that can rush the quarterback or tackle the run well.That means the Seahawks defense will have to force a game. The Broncos might make the big play, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see it, and I believe they do not have enough to make a late field goal. This was the most difficult game for the Broncos since they faced the Bengals in 2002 and lost 42-10.The Broncos beat the Raiders 30-3 at home in the AFC title game last season, but they had to beat the Seahawks on the road at CenturyLink Field. They have done it two times in nine years,	0
Wildlife services in California are being pushed to their limits this year. Since January 2015, every month has set a record in sea lion "strandings," mostly sea lion pups, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "There has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since January," said Justin Greenman, assistant stranding coordinator for NOAA on the West Coast. "Stranding does happen, but just to give you perspective, 1,800 [sea lion] pups have been responded to this year alone. We responded to 1,600 strandings total during the entire year in 2013," he said. Stranding is the official term to describe marine life that "swim or float into shore and become beached or stuck," according to NOAA. Strandings are taking a toll on the resources available in coastal counties from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Local care facilities have taken in more stranded sea lions this year than 2004-12 combined, and it is only mid-March. Greenman said he expects the problem to continue beyond April, when weaning normally occurs, when the pups are 10 or 11 months old. Dave Koontz, director of communications for SeaWorld San Diego, said SeaWorld has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year. "This is a new record for Sea World," Koontz said. "In 1983 we rescued 474." Some of the sea lions responded to have had to be euthanized. "They [sea lion pups] have to be able to eat and fish on their own before they can be released back into the wild, and a lot of these pups haven't even been weaned," Greenman said. Greenman said California has had warmer weather than usual this year, and, while NOAA is still conducting studies on the Channel Islands to get a more proven explanation, warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean, where the colder water is. When food is farther away, the mothers are away from the pup too long in search of food, and return with little food or too few nutrients for a growing sea lion. "We have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches," Greenman said. However, he said, the species has made a comeback since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.	1
In late May 2011, Mitt Romney made his first campaign jaunt to South Carolina, a primary state that bedeviled him during his first presidential campaign and would prove just as vexing in his second. Romney's difficulties with the conservative base are now well-documented. But among his many problems on the right, immigration wasn't one of them. On that May afternoon in South Carolina, Romney, his sleeves rolled up and shirt tucked neatly into bluejeans, came prepared to answer a range of tough questions. He delivered a defense of his health care law and equivocated on a controversial Medicare plan being debated in Congress. He didn't expect to have to talk about immigration, But one activist who felt like a party crasher in the small, hand-picked audience wanted to know if Romney backed amnesty for "illegals." Romney said no, matter-of-factly outlined his positions, and the voter departed seeming satisfied. The point is this: Even if immigration fails to register as a top issue in the polls -- only 3% of Americans called it the country's "most important problem" in a recent Gallup survey -- the topic continues to burn white hot as a litmus test among a passionate and vocal slice of the GOP primary electorate. Opinion: Big surprise ahead on immigration Even when immigration reform is not on the calendar in Congress -- and it wasn't during the 2012 campaign -- it routinely bubbles up in Republican primary campaigns, popping up in town hall meetings, on talk radio and online. And it's not just the dreaded "comprehensive" immigration reform effort that roils grassroots activists; for a defiant portion of the GOP base (looking at you, Steve King), any kind of reform is non-negotiable. Despite efforts by top Republicans in Washington to improve the party's miserable image among Hispanic voters, not much has changed since the 2012 primary campaign, when GOP voters tore down Texas Gov. Rick Perry for telling a debate audience that they didn't "have a heart" if they opposed in-state college tuition for young illegal immigrants. Undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out A sweeping Senate immigration bill is stalled in the House, effectively dead and nailed into its coffin by its own Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio, who now opposes it. House Speaker John Boehner says he is open to passing a series of smaller fixes. At the same time, numerous elected GOP officials made intemperate comments about Hispanic immigrants.	1
Actor Dennis Quaid told lawmakers Wednesday how his newborn twins came close to death after an overdose of blood-thinning medication, the fault of a drug company that did not recall easily confused bottles despite previous problems, he said. Actor Dennis Quaid says that what is happening in the nation's courts "is no fiction." The incident occurred last year at a Los Angeles, California, hospital, Quaid told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In The actor also said the "infants nearly died because of a drug company's failure to put safety first." The panel's hearing focused on the issue of "pre-emption," under which FDA approval guarantees immunity for drug companies against state lawsuits, because federal law supersedes state law. The Supreme Court is mulling the issue in a Vermont case. Oral arguments are expected in early October. "I am in the entertainment industry, but what happened to us, and what is happening in the courts of our country, is no fiction," Quaid said in a statement prepared for members of the House panel. "It is all too real. That is why I have decided to speak out and do something."  Watch Quaid say "Baxter's negligence was an accident waiting to happen" » The actor's actual statement was abridged, as he and other witnesses were given a five-minute time limit on remarks. Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-California, said, "This is exactly the wrong time for the FDA to say, 'Trust us.' As a result of chronic underfunding and weak leadership, FDA's ability to protect the public is plummeting." He said the agency has believed that state liability helped the agency regulate drugs and devices but has changed its stance under the Bush administration. In response to Quaid's testimony, the company that made the drugs involved -- Baxter Healthcare -- issued a statement saying human error was to blame, noting that the finding was supported by the California Department of Public Health. In November, Quaid's 12-day-old twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital. According to standard procedure, nurses were supposed to clean the infants' IV lines with Hep-Lock, a drug containing a very small dose of the blood thinner heparin, to allow the lines to flow freely.	1
A Chinese newspaper has withdrawn its high-profile support of a detained reporter after he confessed on television to releasing fabricated stories "for money and fame." The New Express printed a letter of apology on its website on Sunday that said the newspaper had failed to fact-check his articles and would manage its journalists more closely. The apology was in contrast to the spirited support the publication had given its reporter in the aftermath of his arrest last week. When contacted by CNN, the paper said that it had been asked not to give interviews. Chen Yongzhou was detained by police in Hunan Province on October 18 on suspicion of damaging the commercial reputation of a business after he published a series of articles that exposed financial problems at Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology . On Saturday, he appeared on state broadcaster CCTV and confessed to accepting money to publish false reports about the state-run maker of construction equipment. "I did not check the content of these articles and only made minor changes. The original drafts were provided by other people," Chen said in the interview. Chen wrote more than 10 unverified reports -- from September 29, 2012, until August 8, 2013 -- that centered on "financial problems" experienced by the engineering company Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology, and resulted in losses for the company, Xinhua reported, citing police. In a bold move, New Express had run the headline "Please set him free" on its front page on Wednesday. It reiterated its plea on Friday. The paper also said it had checked all of Chen's stories about Zoomlion and found only one discrepancy. David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, said the newspaper had taken an unprecedented step in its public defense of the reporter but authorities felt it had gone too far. "You can get away with it if you have the political backing, but if you don't you are stepping into dangerous territory and accurate or not accurate is not the most important question," he said. He added that the CCTV broadcast of Chen's confession underlined the political nature of the case, given that the legal investigation has not been completed and Chen has not appeared in court. The reporter's plight had garnered sympathy from other news outlets and China's media regulator vowed to protect "lawful reporting rights," according to the state-run China Press and Publishing Media group.	1
A toddler shot and killed his mother, the boy's father told South Florida police, who say they will talk to the 2-1/2-year-old. The father, who called 911, told police he was trying to take the firearm away from the child when it discharged. The boy's mother -- Julia Bennett, 33 -- was shot once in the back and died from the injury, said Miramar Police spokeswoman Tania Rues. "What we do know is that last Wednesday, shortly after 7 o'clock, we received a 911 call from a gentleman stating that his 2-1/2-year-old son accidentally shot his mother -- the boy's mother," Rues told HLN's Vinnie Politan. Rues said investigators will talk to the toddler about the shooting, but that "due to the age, we're not expecting to get much." The boy's father has not been identified by police. They said he has cooperated fully with the investigation, which started with a 911 call he placed on April 20. In that roughly 4-1/2-minute call, a man's voice can be heard asking the dispatcher what to do. He speaks with a thick accent and seems overcome with emotion as he tries to explain what happened. "My son picked it up and I tried to grab it," the man said about the gun. "Oh God, I can't believe this." Rues said the State Attorney's office will decide whether to file charges. The boy's father could face charges of negligence, she said. Bennett and the boy's father were not married and did not live together at the time of her death, according to Rues. "This should serve as a reminder to all parents out there to not leave firearms accessible to children. Even if you believe the firearm is not loaded, it's just not smart. It's not safe," she said.	1
As they make a final push to approve presidential nominations before Republicans take control of the Senate, Democrats said Tuesday the confirmation of a record number of federal judges was evidence they were right to make controversial changes to filibuster rules, despite objections from Republicans. "Yes," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded loudly when asked if still believes he was right to employ the so-called "nuclear option" a year ago in order to clear a backlog of nominees. The No. 2 Senate Democrat explained that at the time there was a "breakdown in the relationship between the executive and legislative branch." "If you just look at where we were, with all of the nominations stacked on the calendar, most of which had been reported from committees with overwhelming bipartisan votes," Sen. Dick Durbin said.  "Republicans were trying to keep as many nominations from final approval as possible. So we had no choice." During the first year of the congressional session, before the nuclear option, the Senate confirmed a total of 36 federal district and circuit court judges appointed by the President.  After the rules changes, which took place Nov. 21, 2013, the number of judges confirmed more than doubled to 84. The rules change lowered the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51, making it much easier for Democrats, who currently have a 54 to 46 majority, to approve judges to those lifetime positions. Before the Senate adjourns, probably in the next day or two, Democrats hope to confirm an additional 12 district court positions. Democrats this week also cleared a new surgeon general, a top immigration official, and were ready to approve Tuesday the No. 2 at the State Department. Each of those people faced serious GOP opposition and might not have been cleared if not for the rules change. "The train is running over everyone. That's the Reid train. Last trip around the track," complained Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona about the last minute wave of judicial and executive branch nominations Senate Democratic Leader Reid is jamming through. "It's a result of the nuclear option which deprived us of our ability to advise and consent and it's shameful. McCain and other Republicans also blamed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and a small group of other conservatives who forced a weekend session that Reid used to clear procedural hurdles on a number of nominees.	1
After officially hosting a single guest -- Croatia, which its national team ungraciously greeted with a 3-1 drubbing -- Brazil opened its doors wide on Friday, the World Cup's first full day of competition. That meant welcoming the last ides of their group games, the best of which would come only a day later at the Maracanã. But first, with a series of training sessions, Brazil was also trying to shake this hangover from its quarterfinal loss.Brazil's World Cup hangover: "I know only one thing: If I'd have played good, we get into the final."The hangover was real enough, and even without a full game on the schedule, its players were still struggling to come to terms with the day's events. Brazil had been knocked out of the quarters by Colombia in the previous round, and had lost twice in the opening three games, including a late, dramatic 3-2 defeat to France.Yet for a player like Neymar, who had already been a key part of the Brazil squad all week before the first game, the hangover was all the more pronounced. "Of course I'm feeling bad," Neymar told reporters after the game. "But I don't want to play bad right here, and so I need to forget about it ... I need to feel good and ready for the next matches. It's the only way I can play well."Yet Brazil's mood was even grimmer than most. The next day, the players were already leaving the training field for the locker rooms when they saw a TV screen with a banner saying: "Brazil is number one in the world in the 2014 World Cup."Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the loss "We didn't have much time to think about the loss against France. ... We're upset we lost against Colombia, but we just put ourselves at the center. When we go to the World Cup, we're looking at each game as a big opportunity to show people how we can play. I don't know what we did wrong, but we just have to forget about it."Scolari, known as a demanding coach who demanded a great deal of from his players in terms of quality and commitment, insisted that they forget about the loss and instead focus on the next games.But the loss, and the hangover, didn't exactly help. It left Brazil	0
Matt Sandusky stood in solidarity with his adoptive father, Jerry Sandusky, while a grand jury investigated multiple allegations of child rape against the former Penn State assistant football coach. Matt Sandusky told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him. And he sat with the rest of the family early in Jerry Sandusky's recent trial. But last week brought a bombshell that shook the proceedings: Matt Sandusky, 33, was now willing to testify that the man he first met through the Second Mile charity repeatedly molested him while he was a child, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers. The revelation kept Jerry Sandusky from taking the stand in his own defense. Sandusky's son fits pattern of other alleged victims Portions of a 29-minute interview police had with Matt Sandusky during the middle of the trial were broadcast Tuesday on NBC, which obtained the audiotape. Jurors never heard the tape. Detectives asked Matt Sandusky why he was now willing to cooperate. "I mean for my family so that they can really have closure and see what the truth actually is," Matt Sandusky said. "And just to right the wrong, honestly, of going to the grand jury and lying." In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide. "I know that I really wanted to die at that point and time," he said, according to the audio obtained by NBC News. Matt Sandusky, a foster child formally adopted at 18, also described Jerry Sandusky rubbing, hugging and showering with him. "If you were pretending you were asleep and if you were touched or rubbed in some way you could just act like you were rolling over in your sleep, so that you could change positions," said Matt Sandusky. The defendant would sometimes rub near and against his genitals, he told police. The potential witness said he could not recall penetration or oral sex. It was only days before the commonwealth rested, and after some alleged victims had testified, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers, that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors. The younger Sandusky's willingness to testify as a rebuttal witness created a dilemma for Jerry Sandusky's defense team. They wanted their client to testify after the jury heard damning testimony from eight alleged victims, but they decided it against it.	1
Lynsey Addario was five months pregnant and taking photos of skeletal children in the Horn of Africa, when she felt her own baby kicking for the first time. "He came to life as a little person inside me as I entered Somalia, the land ridden with death," writes the Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, of an assignment covering drought victims in 2011. In Addario's line of work, death -- and new life -- abound. Since the mid-1990s, she has covered the Taliban in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, the Syrian refugee crisis, and countless more conflicts for media outlets including Getty Images, The New York Times, and National Geographic. Her spectacular and deeply intimate images shine a light on places few would dare to travel, and are now gathered together for the first time in a vivid memoir called "It's what I do: A photographer's life of love and war." The pictures of malnourished toddlers in Somalia that day came as Addario was coming to terms with her own pregnancy. Until he started kicking inside of her, the 41-year-old had only ever thought of unborn son Lukas as a "pea" or "avocado pit." This was an entirely new jolt of reality for the tenacious American photographer -- "Before Lukas, you know I didn't really think about my mortality," she told CNN. "Becoming a mother hasn't necessarily changed how I shoot, but it certainly has made me more sensitive, and it certainly makes it much harder for me to photograph dying children," she said, her voice warm and raspy over the phone from New York. That's not to say Addario has stepped away from the action since having a child with husband and former Reuters journalist Paul de Bendern; the family now based in London. After all, this is the same woman who covered a prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip, while seven months pregnant with her first child, and less than a year after being kidnapped in Libya. She still goes into war zones, though these days tries to stay away from the front line. "I always knew my death would be a possible consequence of the work I do. But for me it was a price I was willing to pay because this is what I believed in," she said. "Now I think 'OK, I want to cover that story, but how can I do it in a way that I can get home to Lukas?"	1
A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA. The blast caused damage but there were no immediate reports of injury. Policemen inspect the area after a van loaded with a bomb exploded in northeast Madrid. The Red Cross received a call at 7:37 a.m. (1:37 a.m. ET), in the name of ETA, warning of the bomb. The Red Cross immediately contacted police, who cordoned off the area, a Red Cross spokeswoman told CNN. The blast occurred shortly after 9 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) outside the building of a construction company, CNN partner network CNN+ reported. The company, Ferrovial Agroman, is involved in building a high-speed train line in the Basque region, which ETA opposes. The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain. Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA. "What ETA did this morning ratifies the Supreme Court decision last night," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters, at the scene of the explosion. At least 30 vehicles parked in the street were damaged, as well as the construction company offices, the Spanish police said in a statement. The bomb, it added, was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area. Exactly four years ago, on Feb. 9, 2005, ETA placed a bomb in the same Madrid neighborhood that was hit on Monday. That attack caused dozens of injuries, and damaged a different glass-façade office building. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. It is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States.	1
It's the battle of the tech titans. No, not Apple versus Samsung. Sony has gone head-to-head with Microsoft after releasing their next-generation gaming platforms for the holiday shopping season. And according to a recent sales report, Sony's PlayStation4 seems to have won the first round of the battle. The PS4 sold 1.25 million units in the United States during November, while the Xbox One sold 750,000, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, in a recent note to investors. As for global sales, the Japanese manufacturer announced they had sold more than 2.1 million PS4 units worldwide at the beginning of December. Microsoft say they sold over 2 million systems. With the XBox One starting at $499, and the PS4 at $399, Pachter says the the $100 price difference is responsible for Sony's success: "The reason Sony beats Microsoft is solely the price. Microsoft loses the next generation unless they cut price." In at the starting line From the start, it was far from clear which console would reign over the world of gaming. "These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London. The tech landscape has transformed drastically since the last time these two electronics giants went head to head with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and the PlayStation 3 in 2007. Back then, smartphones and tablet devices didn't even exist. While PS4 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- Xbox One is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games, movies, music and applications quickly and seamlessly. "The PlayStation 4 has been set as more of a games machine versus the Xbox One's aim to be the multimedia entertainment center at the heart of your living room ... Both systems are essentially PCs in a console shell," explains Hutchinson. The two systems have everything from motion tracking and facial recognition to cameras and redesigned controllers. What's more, the Xbox One can not only be plugged into your cable box for on-demand TV and movies, but can also be personalized to a user's interests running a series of apps and programs, including Skype, NetFlix and LoveFilm.

Whenever ISIS carries out a new atrocity, whether it's beheading a group of Egyptian Christians or enslaving Yazidi women in Iraq or burning its victims alive, the big question most people have is: Why on Earth is ISIS doing _____? The answer, as always, is usually "Why not?": Why don't we do something ourselves? This is the age-old human impulse to justify our inaction – the old lie that "if only we were the type of people who did it, we would have done it by now."Not only do we have an opportunity to address these atrocities with a new war to fight, but by simply following the news and the social media, we will be able to get a better understanding of what's going on. By learning more about ISIS – and what is happening in the broader Middle East, which is a much more complex picture than in our perception – we will be better equipped to tackle it.If you've been following us on Twitter during this whole catastrophe, you probably already know what's going on. As I was sitting down to write this, we've seen reports of the recent beheadings, of men driving trucks full of human beings, of people being marched off of buses, of people being shot, people being tortured and murdered. The picture isn't pretty, not for us, not for our soldiers. There are reports on Twitter of dead bodies in the streets, of burnt bodies in the desert, of people being burned alive. It's not good.I don't know for sure how to solve the problem. I think one of the most important things we can do, however, is to use what we know about ISIS to try to stop it. This is a war. It's not a video game. ISIS is not just a video game that has to be stopped. We are fighting a terrorist organization that has been using the same tactics and the same ideology since 2006, killing innocent people in the name of their own version of Islam. There have been many videos of ISIS celebrating beheadings, beheadings themselves, beheadings of children, and beheadings of babies. It's the same group. And the group is very skilled. They are killing their own people on a massive scale; it's not an accident. They are very good at it. They are very skilled.I don't pretend to know all the details. I don't live the life the	0
Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says the Turkish TV show "is being done  with the blessing of Erdogan.""It is totally irresponsible to continue with these outrageous and unacceptable scenes," Lieberman said Sunday in his weekly Cabinet meeting. "Any such scenes broadcast on foreign media outlets should be immediately halted. It is disgraceful."His remarks are the latest sign that the already-fragile relationship between Turkey and Israel is heading toward a new level of tension. The Turkish public is angered by what it sees as Israeli and Western hypocrisy and hostility.Lieberman says he met with Turkey's ambassador in March to express his anger over what he called the "deplorable episode," which he said was "done with the blessing of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan."Turkey's embassy in Israel did not immediately return calls for comment.Turkey's relations with Israel soured shortly after Israel's 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, as the military campaign in Gaza drew international condemnation and Israel's heavy casualties.The Israeli-Turkish relationship has also been hit by the fallout from last month's failed coup in Turkey, in which a U.S.-based cleric of the Turkish Muslim Brotherhood was accused of masterminding the putsch and Turkey's foreign minister was dismissed.U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday it's "very hard to not see a lot of red flags and concerns at this point with Erdogan, as well as with the Turkish military, in terms of the Syrian policy and the Kurds, the civil war in Syria and all those other things."Turkey has also refused to allow passage for the U.S. to deliver weapons to Syrian rebel forces and has launched airstrikes on Kurdish fighters.The Turkish-Israeli relationship has been strained before.Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Israel "a cruel country" for bombing Islamist militants inside Turkey in the 1990s and accused Israel of "crimes of genocide" in the 1967 Six-Day War.Turkey has also repeatedly rejected Israeli demands to allow the passage of military convoys in and out of Gaza through the Turkish border.In 2006, Turkey issued a rare diplomatic apology for its role in the killings of Palestinians as part of the Second World War.	0
Google has topped a list of the most reputable companies in the U.S., according to a Harris Interactive poll. Harris Interactive asked more than 30,000 respondents to identify the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. and rate them based on 20 different attributes, including financial performance, emotional appearance, social responsibility and leadership. Technology companies dominated the top of the list. At number one is Google, which Harris Interactive rates at an 84.05/100 on the reputation scale (80.0 and higher is consider "excellent"). Other notable tech companies making the top of the list were Apple (No. 5), Intel (No. 6), Amazon (No. 8), Sony (No. 14) and Microsoft (No. 16), all of whom received a rating higher than 80. Rounding out the bottom of the list were insurance conglomerates, banks, and oil companies. AIG received the worst reputation ranking with a 47.77. BP, the company responsible for the worst oil spill in history, had the second-worst ranking. Other companies that made the bottom tier of Harris Interactive's list include Comcast, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ExxonMobile, General Motors, Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Despite government investigations and privacy concerns, the world's largest search engine still enjoys a supremely positive image in the eyes of its millions of users.

Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say human trafficking has seen "alarming growth" in the region. The 60 bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay  told a gathering at Washington’s National Cathedral they are “gravely worried” about the problem and want to do more to combat it. The bishops are responding to Pope Francis’s call for action on human trafficking, and at least one of their proposals was to create a Catholic agency dedicated to fighting it.The bishops’ statement, which they delivered on the first day of a meeting on human trafficking, included their recommendations to the pope and urged him to take action — including making explicit the “paramount moral claim” of those who are trafficked and calling for an international conference on the subject. They also called for more efforts in combatting human trafficking, adding that “the only sustainable solution is a transformation in the social, economic and sexual lives of people subjected to trafficking.”“Many crimes against children are committed in silence where victims are afraid to speak out, where the courts refuse to acknowledge the crime and where the police do little to protect them,” South American Catholics said in a statement after Tuesday’s meeting. “The church has long called for action to prevent, combat and eliminate such crimes; the voices of victims are clearly heard in the bishops’ statements.”The bishops said they were inspired by the pope’s efforts in Brazil to combat sex trafficking and in other places. “The church has a clear duty to respond and protect those who are abused,” they said, adding that they thought the United States would be an ideal place for the talks.One bishop said they would like to see a “Catholic agency” established to combat human trafficking — something the bishops said they have discussed with the Vatican. “We would like to see a Catholic agency — a religious agency that would meet with victims in the pastoral area, with social sectors and human rights groups to talk about the issue and also find solutions.”That proposal has been strongly opposed by U.S. Catholic organizations, who contend that the church isn’t equipped to tackle the problem and that the pope’s call for action is “overreaching.”‘Overreaching’?The U.S. bishops — who	0
The future of social networking, the real-time Web and a host of apps and gadgets were the talk of the annual Le Web conference as it opened here Wednesday. The phenomenal success of microblogging site Twitter and its plans for the future dominated as social media is the theme of the opening sessions Thursday.Twitter is a powerful tool and a great way to engage with people in real time. But in the end, its real-time nature is not going to overcome its weaknesses that has prevented many others from realizing their potential.The real-time Web, which is being developed for the Web by many groups, is still very nascent. And with every major social network trying to move in that direction, the real-time Web is also going to have its flaws.The Web's success in the past few years has certainly been driven by the use of the Web and social networking tools. But it seems that Twitter and some other services have made the Web's use and usefulness clearer.But the Twitter of tomorrow may be the real-time Web of today. Or it could be the Web that is made up of many different micro blogs in the end.This is the kind of Web where your blog is just a simple information sharing tool for a few hours at a time.In a nutshell, the real-time Web is supposed to be a "social" Web and more social interaction using the tools people like Twitter have made available."What's missing from the Web is the ability to talk with your friends and colleagues in real time," said Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape and later WebTV and now chief executive of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.He was joined at the opening by a host of other Web luminaries, including venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel, former Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates and the social networking pioneer, MySpace founder Sean Parker."It's not hard to see why you would want a real-time Web where information is exchanged in real time. But what's missing is having the tools to do it as well," said Gates, who noted that the real-time Web has "much higher latency" than the Web of today, which is much slower."If you want to find somebody on Facebook, you can do it in real time. But if you want to find someone on Twitter, it can get frustrating and	0
Here's a record-setting job that qualifies as a "heavy lift." On Thursday, workers in Indiana and Kentucky finished sliding a new nearly half-mile-long, 30 million-pound bridge from one set of piers to another, making it the "longest bridge in North America -- and perhaps the world" -- to slide laterally into place, according to the Indiana Department of Transportation. The Milton-Madison Bridge spans the Ohio River, linking U.S. 421 between Madison, Indiana, and Milton, Kentucky. Starting Wednesday, workers moved it 55 feet from temporary piers to permanent refurbished piers. High winds across the river forced a delay in the job, until it could be completed the next day. Here's how they did it: Workers placed polished steel sliding plates on top of the refurbished piers. Then, they pulled the bridge from the temporary piers to the refurbished piers with steel cables and eight computer-controlled hydraulic jacks. Bridge geeks call this a steel truss bridge. It measures 2,428 feet long and 40 feet wide. For drivers, it has two 12-foot-wide lanes and shoulders measuring 8 feet. For folks who prefer to walk, officials plan to add a 5-foot-wide sidewalk to the bridge during the coming months. After inspections and and the completion of road connections, the bridge is expected to reopen to traffic in about a week. Deterioration of the 85-year-old original bridge prompted the estimated $131 million project. The old Milton-Madison Bridge was only one of more than a half-million aging bridges nationwide. A report released last year by Transportation for America labeled the bridge "structurally deficient." Drivers and passengers expect this critical infrastructure to be safe and reliable every day. How safe is that bridge you're driving over? The average age of all 607,380 bridges in the United States is 42 years, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. About 25% of them are classified as deficient, according to a 2013 report by the Federal Highway Administration. To make all necessary repairs to America's bridges, the federal government estimates that it will cost $76 billion, according to the engineer group.	1
Richard Leakey has spent a lifetime exploring Kenya's Turkana Basin searching for the origins of man. Each layer of sediment, says the paleoanthropologist and founder of the Turkana Basin Institute, helps to tell the narrative ix the evolution of hominids as they spread out of Africa, through the ages of Homo, through modern man. ixThe Turkana Basin is one of Kenya's most mysterious, largely uncharted and often inaccessible landscapes. Its mysterious location has attracted explorers, and while some were successful, few actually explored the entire site. Here we travel deep into the wilderness in search of clues and evidence. ixIn this travelogue, we follow three different routes through this region, from the deserts of western Turkana to Lake Turkana and the snow-capped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. We spend time in the Turkana Desert, the vast expanse in north-eastern Kenya that is largely untouched. In addition, we travel to the Turkana Basin Institute, where we meet a specialist who takes us into unexplored caves, an ancient town and the ruins of a long-gone kingdom. We meet a renowned archaeologist, a brilliant biologist, a naturalist and many more with the Turkana Basin. ix ixWe are in the last third of a journey through Kenya to the Turkana Basin. It is not the first time we have done this but it is the first time in a year when we have visited the Turkana Basin over a longer period. Since we are doing this with David Attenborough and Steve Irwin, two naturalists and explorers, we have much longer on-camera access than on some other trips. ix ixThe Turkana Basin Institute was founded by Professor Leakey and Dr Richard Leakey in 1972, and has a staff of more than 350 people. The Turkana Basin Institute has a world-class research centre and extensive facilities, including the world?s largest laboratory, a large library, museum, conference room and archive. ix ix The institute maintains archives covering the full range of its activities from the history and archaeology of Turkana to contemporary science and conservation. It also provides training in conservation to government officials and to members of the scientific community. ix ix ix ix ix ixIn the archives, I found an extraordinary series of papers on Turkana by Professor Leakey.

By now, we're on the same page that Mitt Romney's pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy -- run to the conservative (or liberal) base to win the nomination and then reposition toward Ã¢â‚¬ËœmoderateÃ¢â‚¬Â voters. But a quick look at Ryan's record before his selection will tell you that Romney, at least on the day he announced his vice-presidential pick, was going on an outreach tour that could as well have been dubbed a "re-education mission."In the early 1990s, Ron Paul became the darling of a small but influential contingent of libertarians. By the early 2000s, the libertarian movement began to crumble.(You can watch the entire video below. Paul explains in more depth in the video.)But some members of the Ron Paul movement, including Paul's son Rand, are still willing to take a shot at winning the presidency, even if it's not a very good one."We could spend all of our time in the liberty movement trying to do positive things for the country," says Rand Paul. "It's not easy. There's a lot of challenges within the Republican Party, the libertarian movement is one of them. But I think if we keep working on what we do, as we're talking about, we could get the country to turn toward the center ground, to the center. And we could get us to the White House."This is not the first time Rand Paul has taken credit where it wasn't his own. "I think some of the time when it's good that we look at the history of the libertarian movement, it gives us an idea and an example of what's possible in any of the movements," he says.If we're really going to win this election, we need to get on our message to millions of people -- especially those who are undecided. We've got to get them to listen, get them to engage, and most of all, get them to vote. And that's what's so important to me about this pick.He's right. There are two ways one can get people to listen to a message -- one is to have the message, and the other is to have people listen to it.Paul's campaign is trying to use his selection as a way to achieve both	0
If there's attention to be had, you better believe the Kardashians know how to grab it. On Tuesday night, Instagram was on fire thanks to two posts made by Kim and Khloe Kardashian. One of the images, posted by Khloe, made a joke about the Ku Klux Klan that has unleashed a wave of criticism. And then, just a few hours after Khloe posted (and deleted) the inflammatory photo, Kim decided to unleash her naked, oiled butt onto the world. We're not joking. The 34-year-old posed for the winter issue of Paper magazine, which has the express goal of "breaking the Internet." (In that case, Paper can consider its mission accomplished.) The publication chose photographer Jean-Paul Goude to do the honors, asking the artist to recreate his "Champagne Incident" photograph. The result is one cover in which Kim poses in a floor-length gown, balancing a glass of champagne on her rear, while the other cover puts the reality star's best known asset front and center in all its glistening glory. If you're curious, husband Kanye West approves. "And they say I didn't have a talent," Kardashian tweeted after sharing the photos. "Try balancing a champagne glass on your a** LOL." That doesn't sound easy, but we'd say the Kardashians also have a clear talent for provocation. Before Kim set out to #BreakTheInternet, her younger sister was on the verge of doing so as well. Khloe, 30, posted a picture on Instagram of herself with her sisters Kim and Kourtney that was captioned: "the only KKK to ever let black men in." It isn't clear where the image originated, but Khloe shared that along with her own comment, calling the statement "True." (Khloe was married to an African-American basketball player, Lamar Odom, and Kim has dated a number of famous African-American men, from singer Ray J to athlete Reggie Bush.) The post has since been removed, but the controversy hasn't been erased as easily. Khloe hasn't explicitly commented on the reaction, but some believe one of her recent Instagram posts is an attempt at an apology. "We're all equally f****d up," says the photo in the post, which was shared Tuesday. "Some only hide it better."	1
The sub-zero climes of northern Sweden are an unlikely outpost for the world's hippest tech firms. Temperatures have been known to plummet to a bone-chilling minus-40 degrees centigrade in the winter months, while the rural landscape is more commonly associated with the sparkling beauty of the northern lights than the humdrum back office of cloud computing. But it's here, in the tiny sub-Arctic town of Lulea, that Facebook has operated a 30,000 square meter server farm since 2013 -- its first such facility outside the U.S.. So content with the operation is the social media giant that it announced the creation a second data center in Lulea earlier this year. According to Malin Frenning regional head of telecoms firm TeliaSonera the region has plenty to offer big international companies despite its distant location. "There is a lot of (engineering) competence ... and good cooperation with the technical universities," Frenning said. On top of that, good transport links ensure its easily accessible by road and by air while solid infrastructure ensures business stability. TeliaSonera is currently laying down Skanova Backbone North, a 1,250-kilometer (776-mile) fiber cable that will serve mobile and communications networks as well as provide the digital infrastructure that data centers in northern Sweden require. "As far as we understand it this is one of the best places to establish data centers," Frenning added. The Facebook move has inevitably attracted the attention of other firms with large data storage needs. Lulea will soon host another large data facility for UK-based data-storage specialist firm, Hydro66, while the nearby town of Boden welcomed Bitcoin mining group KnCMiner earlier this year. Across the border in Finland, Google runs a similar operation in the town of Hamina. And a thousand miles over the Norwegian Sea in Iceland specialist data storage firm Verne Global caters for large firms likes of German car manufacturer BMW. With so many wealthy companies with increased data related needs, storage clearly has the potential to become a highly lucrative business in this part of the world. A report from management firm, Boston Consultancy Group estimated that the Facebook's presence in Sweden will be worth upwards of 9 billion Swedish Kroner ($1.2 billion) and 4,500 direct and indirect jobs over a 10-year period.	1
The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the back, city officials and police said Monday, amid continuing unrest in the region. The attack on Mayor Gennady Kernes Ã‚Ân was the latest in a string of incidents in eastern Ukraine that have left dozens dead and wounded since the overthrow of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych Ã‚Â in early 2014.“The mayor is in critical condition,” said Yurii Mykhennyk, the head of the city government, speaking with reporters on an air force helicopter, after the 65-year-old Kernes was taken to a hospital in Kharkiv early on Monday.Kernes said he was shot twice in the back and was losing consciousness. Mykhennyk said it may take up to a week to fully explain what exactly happened.“I didn’t hear what shot me, but I don’t expect my health to improve in one day,” Kernes told Ukraine’s IWTV1 channel.Kernes said he is receiving treatment for a heart attack.Local authorities said Kernes sustained two gunshot wounds. A city spokesman had earlier claimed that a masked man was behind the attack.Kernes, in an apparent bid to demonstrate support for the protesters, posted a photograph on his Facebook page showing him wearing a T-shirt and holding a sign that said: “I love Maidan!” while being taken away in the helicopter. ”The helicopter had the words “Ukraine 1.0” on its side, a reference to the current political situation.The Ukrainian Security Service called the shooting a “terrorist attack” and added that a “terrorist commando unit” had been uncovered in the area, Interfax-Ukraine reported.“This commando unit is preparing a terrorist attack from the city centre so it is the right time for the city to take appropriate countermeasures,” the agency said.Mykhennyk said in a conference call with journalists Monday he believed that he may have had “a chance to kill or die” in the attack, but added that he is also in “good health.”One of the attackers was said by the police to be wearing a	0
The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France. Federer secured the winning point in his singles match against Fabio Fognini to give Switzerland an unbeatable 3-1 lead over Italy in Geneva. The 17-time grand slam winner was never seriously troubled by Fognini, winning 6-2 6-3 7-6 in front of 18,000 fans in the Palexpo Arena. A run of four straight games saw him take the opening set and a single break in the second was enough to forge further ahead. Fognini had four break point chances in the third set but could not take advantage and Federer moved clear in the closing tiebreak. The 33-year-old will be playing in his first Davis Cup final and paid tribute to the fervent supporters who willed him on to victory. "Its nice sharing your emotions with your fans and team mates," he told the official Davis Cup website. Swiss captain Severin Luthi also reflected on their triumph. "For the whole of Switzerland it's great we're in the finals now. We couldn't be happier," he said. "Roger didn't have that much time to get used to the court and conditions and there is a lot of pressure involved. For me he played again fantastic tennis." Federer and Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka won their opening singles rubbers Friday but the Italians hit back the following day as Fognini and Simone Bolleli took the doubles to give themselves a glimmer of hope heading into the reverse singles. Switzerland will have to travel to France for the final on November 21-23, with the venue still to be announced. France sealed its passage Saturday when the doubles team of Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Czechs Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek in four sets to go 3-0 ahead. Sunday's reverse singles saw Jiri Vesely beat Julien Benneteau 6-4 6-3 to put the first point on the board for the Czechs before Gael Monfils beat Lukas Rosol 5-7 6-4 7-5 in the second of the "dead" rubbers.	1
America's economy has the potential to transform lives like no other force on Earth, but too often in recent years we have seen Washington act as an anchor. And while CEOs and presidents may generate the business headlines, an over-involved federal government hurts employees and those looking for jobs across the entire spectrum. As someone who grew up in poverty, watching his single mother work 16-hour days to provide as much as she possibly could for us, I have lived the power of the American Dream. With help from my mom and my mentor, I learned that I didn't have to be an entertainer or an athlete to achieve my goals; I could think my way out of poverty. I realized the power of education, and the incredible opportunities provided by free markets. Sen. Cory Booker: Finishing our nation's unfinished business My fear is that too many folks these days aren't given the chance to see the greatness that resides within them. Over the past 50 years, we've seen the War on Poverty struggle in its core mission -- to help lift folks up. It's time for a change, so I have introduced my Opportunity Agenda. A significant part of my Opportunity Agenda is focused on job-training efforts. There are 4 million open jobs across the country right now -- jobs that are unfilled because of a skills gap in the work force. This in spite of the fact there are 35 federal work-force development programs. My SKILLS Act, which the House has already passed thanks to the efforts of Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, would cut through the bureaucratic maze and mountains of red tape that hinder these programs. We'll create one Workforce Investment Fund, cutting waste and duplication out while ensuring more dollars are used for their actual purpose -- job training. President Barack Obama signaled that Vice President Joe Biden would be looking at job-training programs this year -- I eagerly await their call to discuss my proposal. I am also working on a proposal to create opportunity zones across America to tie some of the tax dollars coming out of our low-income communities to the community itself in order to rebuild infrastructure and lift those areas up. In my time on county council in Charleston County, this concept was referred to as Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts, and I see great potential in this concept at the federal level.	1
U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to expand the military campaign against ISIS terrorists into Syria, and to boost American backing for rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, represents a grave escalation that risks dragging the U.S. and its allies into an open-ended regional war. In his televized speech to the nation on Wednesday evening, Obama argued his proposed strategy of extended air strikes and use of local ground forces (but not American combat troops) against the extremists also known as ISIL and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was fundamentally different from past White House policies that led the U.S. to fight two Middle East ground wars in as many decades. But Obama, as he has shown repeatedly since 2008, is a reluctant warrior with no particular expertise in armed conflict. No doubt John F. Kennedy felt that he, too, understood the risks when he started sending American advisors to Saigon in the early 1960s. Like JFK, he may be starting a fight he cannot finish, which will run on and on for untold years. Obama, who came to office wearing the mantle of a man of peace and agent of change, has ultimately proved little different in this respect from predecessors such as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. His tone on television was nationalistic and bombastic. American primacy, he said, was "the one constant in an uncertain world." He continued: "Our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead." In Obama's case this sounds slightly disingenuous. Facing a rising, ignorant right-wing clamor about his alleged weakness and indecision in world affairs, the Obama of the "Yes We Can" era has slowly and unwillingly been transformed into Barack the Bomber. In 2008 Obama promised an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new deal with the Muslim world, a reset in relations with Russia, and real-time nuclear disarmament. Six years later, his plans mostly lie in ruins, shot down like an unsuspecting aircraft over eastern Ukraine, and he is in danger of going backwards. "I've spent four-and-a-half years working to end wars, not to start them," Obama said last year, explaining his decision not to punish al-Assad for his chemical weapons attacks.	1
The United States on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on a North Korean company that the United Nations said is linked to the country's nuclear weapons program. News comes on day U.S. State Department Envoy Philip Goldberg met with U.N. sanctions committee. A U.S. Treasury Department statement said Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation is owned or controlled by Korea Ryonbong General Corporation, which has been designated by the United Nations as a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The order freezes any U.S. assets of Hyoksin and prohibits any Americans from dealing with it, the statement said. It notes that a sanctions committee set up by the U.N. Security Council recently cited Hyoksin for involvement in development of weapons of mass destruction. The announcement came as the U.S. coordinator for implementation of U.N. sanctions against North Korea met Thursday with the Security Council sanctions committee. The envoy, Philip Goldberg, said the talks showed "strong commitment" by all nations to enforcing Security Council Resolution 1874, which authorized sanctions against North Korea's weapons program. "What I found in that room and in my dealings with other governments ... is unity of view," Goldberg said, specifically mentioning China, which is North Korea's longtime supporter. "Commitment to implementation is strong and unified," he said.	1
They were outside every polling station I visited in Cairo: earnest young men bent over laptops on rickety tables, checking names and ID numbers against voting lists, explaining to people where they were supposed to vote, and, in light of Egypt's wildly  contested results of the March 24 election, explaining how they were able to help.They were there at the rallies of Egypt’s president, Mohamed Morsi, and his ruling Muslim Brotherhood, the largest and most effective opposition party. They were there, in the heat of the campaign, working to spread their message to voters: change.It was a message that was echoed in dozens of other countries around the world, including the United States. “Morsi is not the Islamist party that you have been led to believe,” read a message from the Muslim Brotherhood in Florida on the eve of a crucial primary there. “There is no support in the Muslim Brotherhood for Sharia law.”This was a big change. The Brotherhood was a banned party in Egypt. Many observers considered Mr. Morsi to be part of the Brotherhood. He had been a presidential candidate in the first free elections in Egypt, and was a member of the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party. He had even called “Brothers” to vote for him, in a call to the Brotherhood’s central headquarters before the first election.The Brotherhood’s leaders had for months been preparing the party for a comeback. Before Mr. Morsi had even been inaugurated, he had won the Brotherhood’s nomination for president, and had promised, after elections were over, to go back to the courts, ban the Brotherhood, and dissolve the party as a whole.But the Egyptian economy was in crisis. The country had been hit by a financial crisis, a war, and an Islamist insurgency, and the United States had imposed and threatened sanctions on the Brotherhood because of its role in that war. The economy was teetering, and Mr. Morsi’s promise to go back to courts was not an easy one to make, even to Egypt’s most radical Brotherhood leaders.Mr. Morsi never wanted to leave the Brotherhood. Once the Brotherhood, which he now headed, had returned to the courts, he would have been free to go, he said, if he did not wish to continue to be a member of the committee that would choose the next leader	0
It paid to be a "Lost" fan Tuesday night. That is, it paid $150. Four of the six numbers drawn in the estimated $380 million Mega Millions lottery matched the numbers immortalized by the Lost character Hugo "Hurley" Reyes, who hit a $114 million jackpot off them -- only to be haunted by the same numbers in later episodes. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). Hurley's numbers were 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Unnerved watchers of the hit television show must have been left wondering whether the Dharma Initiative had a hand in the drawing. If you played Hurley's numbers, you won $150, according to a payout table on the Mega Millions website, though the same table noted that fixed prizes such as the $150 one "may be paid on a pari-mutuel basis and (be) lower than" that amount. But at least two people fared better than Hurley after Tuesday night's drawing. Two tickets matched all six numbers, according to a news release from Mega Millions. Owners of those tickets, which were sold in Idaho and Washington, will split the jackpot. David Workman, a spokesman for the Idaho Lottery, said he did not know where in his state the ticket was sold. Idaho began selling tickets on January 31, 2010. "Idaho is a very lucky place," he added. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.	1

Levy Izhak ‘s $1.5 million bail was revoked on Thursday and he is scheduled to appear in federal court on July 11.The two-year-old criminal investigation into public officials in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and at least five other states is the tip of the iceberg in the long-gestating political scandal known as Bridgegate. Yet when it comes to the public’s ability to investigate their government, little has changed as the public has become conditioned to take their government at face value (if not its word).With a nearly 20-year history of government officials lying to the public, the nation’s voters may only begin to see the truth of the situation after November 8, when President Barack Obama faces re-election, and after the midterm elections.When it comes to the nation’s voters, there are three fundamental questions they must ask:Is the president lying?Is a national scandal?Can the public obtain the information necessary to determine the truth?First, the president is not lying about the Bridgegate scandal, despite the fact that he has lied to them. He is using political cover-ups, and the only people doing harm to the nation are members of his party, and their friends in the press corps who have been willing to repeat the president’s lies on their radio shows, in print, and in television ads.Second, the Bridgegate scandal is just one more piece of the larger Republican and Democratic party corruption scandal, and the public needs more information, not less. They need to know about what lies in between the cover-ups and the criminal indictments. And they need to know what the president personally told them about the Bridgegate story.Third, there’s no way to learn the truth without information that isn’t already available in	0
Gunmen who shot dead Facundo Cabral likely did not have the Argentine folk singer as their intended target, said Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Menocal. Cabral, one of Latin America's  most popular musicians who sang in a style similar to Garbo, was fatally wounded last Friday by suspected criminals, and his body was found the following morning. Police believe the killing was a revenge attack for a robbery at Cabral’s home over a month ago."We cannot say the assailants were targeting a celebrity, but it's very likely to have been a coincidence," Menocal told reporters during a press conference on Saturday. "They had no known plans to steal from him or to carry a grudge."His comments came in response to a question from AP about Cabral, whom US President Donald Trump called a “terrifyingly beautiful” man who was killed for “persecuting the LGBTQ community.”“It's not really a case of ‘you might have had some enemies out there,’ " Menocal said. "I would not be surprised at all to hear it was a criminal conspiracy.”The body of Cabral, who was in his mid-30s, was found early Friday morning in an open-air area of Guatemala City’s Santa María neighborhood. That was after the death certificate was issued. After a preliminary autopsy, the case was sent for further analysis and the body was turned over to the authorities, according to the spokesman for Guatemala’s national police.The initial report from the Guatemalan authorities indicated the assailants had been armed with handguns, but an investigation conducted by the National Civil Guard – an agency of the Interior Ministry – also confirmed having used a pickup truck to kill Cabral, police said Saturday.Cabral, known as "El Cantante," in Spanish, was an internationally known opera singer. He was born in the country and became a naturalized US citizen in 2003 after living for a year in the United States.The singer’s death follows a spate of violence against the LGBTQ community in Guatemala. Last February, six members of the LGBT community were gunned down by a group of people they described as gangs.Last month, 12 people were killed in Guatemala’s national capital after a group that describes itself as a political group for LGBT and women’s rights,	0
Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual  crackdown on demonstrators that would become one of the most visible symbols of Communist China. Many years later, when I had read Michael Lebowitz's account in his book _The Chinese Dream_ , I was intrigued to find that he had confirmed the story of the marching exercises in the Square. While I had been studying Chinese as a student in California, I had been taken to the then new International School in New York City, and a little boy taught there claimed to have taught me the story of how Beijing and Tiananmen Square had been founded. The little boy had said that in the year 828, while he was still a small child, Emperor Yizong of the Tang dynasty began the construction of Beijing. This led to the expansion of the city and the founding of Tiananmen Square, which had two important features in my imagination. First, of course, it had the character of a place of protest with its rows and rows of people in front of government buildings. Second, it was the square where a woman named Tiananmen had stood to speak out against the brutal Japanese invasion of China, which had killed an estimated 25 million people in a single year. At the time, this young woman was a young woman of twenty-four years of age. By the time of the uprising, she was twenty-seven. The Japanese had used a small cannon to bomb a hole in the wall of the old Beijing Mosque where they were trying to bomb the city that year, and the mosque became known as the Mosque of Love in tribute to it. When the bombing was over, twenty-seven-year-old Tiananmen was shot in the chest by Japanese soldiers and died. (Tiananmen Square itself is the location where she was shot and where she was laid to rest. After she was laid to rest, a bronze statue of her has been there since the first year after the uprising.) In the year following Tiananmen's death, Beijing grew to be one of the most important cities in China. The years from Tiananmen Square to the present day have, in the main, been years of incredible development in the city.I had come to Beijing in the winter of 1971. I had been living in Los Angeles and had come to visit	0
A Swedish man is being investigated by police after apparently trying to put together a nuclear reactor in his apartment, Sweden's nuclear watchdog said Thursday. The man, named in local media reports as 31-year-old Richard Handl, contacted the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in July to ask whether he was allowed to build a nuclear reactor, the organization's research director Leif Moberj told CNN. That contact led the authorities to swoop down on his home in Angelholm, a coastal town of about 40,000 people known for its long sandy beaches. "We realized he probably had radioactive material at his home which you are not allowed to have without a permit, which was why the authorities decided to inspect his home," Moberj said. Radioactive material was found during an "extensive" inspection last month, although testing suggested radiation levels were too low for his neighbors to be worried, Moberj said. The material included "small amounts" of Americium-241, a component of smoke detectors which cannot legally be removed from the detector casing, he said. The agency has not yet confirmed what other radioactive materials were found at the property. Handl was quoted by the Helsingborgs Dagblad newspaper as saying he had his own Geiger counter and had not noticed any problems with radiation. He never got the reactor going as he had just bought what was needed, Handl was quoted as saying, and now all his equipment has been taken away. Handl told the newspaper he intended to keep to the "theoretical level" in future. Moberj said the situation was "extremely unusual" in Sweden. "I haven't heard of any similar things ever," he said. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the man-made radioactive metal americium "poses a significant risk" to health if ingested or inhaled. It recommends never dismantling or burning a smoke detector at home.	1
Pope Francis has reassigned a conservative American cardinal from a key post to one that is mostly symbolic. Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading conservative, has been  moved from the papal secretary of state to the post that is next on the papal agenda for the new conclave, the Vatican's most important gathering of cardinals.The cardinal whose post will become vacant is Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who has served for 12 years in the Vatican. He was appointed by the Pope in 2005 to be secretary of state — the Vatican's second-most important post, behind the pope himself.In the last papal conclave, which produced Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Sodano was one of the cardinals who voted for the then-pope's election in 2005. The current pontiff appointed him to the rank of cardinal last October.Cardinal Sodano is now considered a likely non-voting member of the conclave, which begins next Tuesday, May 24. The Pope already has removed two cardinals from the conclave: Cardinal Bertone and Cardinal Ouellet. Ouellet, who was the head of the Vatican's secretariat of state but was also a cardinal, was removed along with him from the conclave in 2005. Bertone, who was head of the Congregation for Bishops and was a cardinal, was removed along with him from the conclave in 1997.Pope Francis' move removes from the conclave the two most influential men in the Vatican—Sodano and Cardinal Bertone—as well as Bertone's nephew and Bertone's longtime aide. Both men are conservative cardinals, and both are close to Cardinal Sodano. The removal of these two men from the conclave could set off a diplomatic battle about the conclave. The non-voting cardinals would be a group of cardinals that the Pope does not need to consult on matters related to the conclave.If Pope Francis moves Cardinal Sodano to a non-voting post, the Pontiff would be following a long tradition that has not always been favorable for conservatives. Pope Paul VI moved Monsignor Guillermo Suarez, another conservative cardinal, from his post in the conclave of 1978 to the position of an alternate cardinal to take up a post that was filled by a conservative cardinal. Pope John Paul II moved Cardinal Hans Kelsen from a key papal position of the conclave for a non-voting	0

In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U.S. officials said Wednesday. Gen. David Petraeus will be nominated to take over as CIA director, and Lt. Gen. John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U.S-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters. In addition, longtime diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said. President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official. It is the biggest reshaping of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by Gates to step aside this year. More changes also are coming. Both Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year. Gates will resign effective June 30, assuming Panetta gets confirmed by Congress in time and is ready to start on July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls Gates was making to legislators and senior staff members. Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1. In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said. Initial reaction from Congress was positive, with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good choices. "The sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time," said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer. I could not be more pleased with these selections. I hope these nominees receive swift approval by the United States Senate." Gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended Panetta for his job six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped speaking to him for days for doing so, the officials said. In addition, Gates was saying that Allen was a consensus choice to succeed Petraeus, according to the officials.	1
Thanks to the circular firing squad nature of the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, it had begun to look as if President Obama would coast to re-election in November. But then came along high gas prices. The recent dramatic increase in gas prices could become the issue that slows the economy, stalls the recovery and sinks the president's chances at a second term. As a Republican who recognizes President Obama's great skill as campaigner-in-chief, I'm shocked he has handled the issue so poorly. Even most of those who agree presidents can't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering. Sixty-five percent of Americans tell pollsters they disapprove of the president's handling of gas prices. Average gas prices have reached $3.87 nationwide, the highest ever recorded in March. The prices are expected to go even higher as the summer driving season arrives. If President Obama can't change the perception that he can't do anything about it, he could find himself pumping his own gas after November. The international markets are unlikely to save him, given the current unrest in the Middle East and rising demand in China, India and elsewhere. Popular opinion -- and the U.S. economy -- could take a strong turn against him if the situation is not rectified by summer. Americans will not appreciate paying $5 per gallon or more on their vacations. Those in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Nevada and Colorado could be particularly annoyed. They will come to see his energy policy -- calling oil "the fuel of the past," and slowing the permit process for drilling in the Gulf -- as crafted to please his friends in the green movement. And while the president is set to begrudgingly fast track the southern portion of the XL Keystone pipeline, he does not appear to have bought into the merits of the entire project.	1
Reigning world champions, Italy have been held to a 1-1 draw by New Zealand in their World Cup Group F match at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit. The All Whites took a shock lead after seven minutes when Shane Smeltz turned in Simon Elliot's free kick from close range. Replays showed that Smeltz was offside when Kiwi defender Winston Reid flicked the ball on to him, but the lineman's flag stayed down. The goal instigated a frenzied period of Italian pressure which eventually told when referee Carlos Batres awarded a penalty after defender Tommy Smith tugged at Daniele De Rossi's shirt in the Kiwi's penalty area. Striker, Vincenzo Iaquinta stepped up and sent keeper Mark Paston the wrong way to level the scores. Italy continued to press in the second half but found no route through a spirited and steadfast defense expertly organized by Kiwi captain Ryan Nelsen. Despite throwing on all his three substitutes by the 61st minute, Italian coach, Marcello Lippi and his players found their attacking edge continually blunted. Even their long range efforts were dealt with. In the 70th minute, Riccardo Montolivo's 25-yard drive fizzed towards goal only for keeper Paston to produce the save of the match and push the ball to safety. The stalemate continued, but New Zealand's Chris Wood could have won it for the All Whites in the 83rd minute when he shot narrowly wide of Federico Marchetti's left post. The result leaves Italy progression to the knockout stage in doubt. A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group. Coach Lippi said his team lacked "lucidity." "The result is 1-1 so we just have to pull up our socks and win our next game because we don't want to go home early," Lippi said, AFP reported. "We are in a difficult situation but we are not in a panic situation. We will have to win the next match." For New Zealand, a team ranked 73 places below Italy in FIFA's official world rankings, the result is one to savor. "It's an incredible result and it's way above anything we have achieved before against the stature of our competitors," New Zealand's coach Ricki Herbert said, AFP reported.	1
The "Dream 9," five women and four men, say that they are "undocumented and unafraid." Don't believe it. I bet they were afraid. Who wouldn't have been? The nine -- Claudia Amaro, Adriana Gil Diaz, Luis Perez, Elizabeth Perez, Mary Flores, Sonia Vazquez, Marisol Ventura, Carmen Reyes, and Eunice Yzaguirre -- all met in thecourthouse in downtown Houston, where the U. S. Immigrationand Customs Enforcement (ICE) had just arrested them as"illegal aliens" and put them back on the deport list.The day was overcast, and the eight of us were wearing allkinds of clothing, including "the traditional garb of theundocumented" (which means that nobody has papers, or hasbeen granted permission to come to the United States in thefirst place). We were in the back of a van, which had beenparked at the corner of Houston and Sixth. We had come on ascooter, so we were all wearing the same kind of scooterleggings. This is not a good idea, a few of us argued. On thescooter, we should be able to talk about what was happeningto us.We arrived at our destination: an open field outside theoffice of immigration judge and immigration attorney, JudgeCarmen Bay. There were eight of us, which makes us the"Dream 9." We came from the cities of Hidalgo, Reynosa,and Matamoros, as well as from the small town of Monterrey.We had been arrested at the El Paso border crossing, whichis, of course, not in Texas, and then we had stayed inprison for two weeks or so, and were then told that wewould all be released in 20 days. That is, after 20 days inprison, we would go back to our homes back in Mexico, orelse we would be deported back to our countries.We had no idea that we would be deported from the UnitedStates. In the very first court hearing that we attendedthat day, it was the judge's job to determine whether ornot we would be deported back to our countries of origin asa result of our recent arrest and detention in	0
Sorry, dear readers, but the crop circle discovered last week etched in a farmer's barley field in Chualar, California, was not created by aliens. Instead -- surprise! -- it was a stunt intended to attract publicity to the vernacular of a group of farmers. No, it was no hoax; it was real and it was huge.The Chualar circle is the fifth longest of its kind, after one that was discovered in an outhouse at the entrance to a remote cave in southern Sweden and one at Siena, Italy, that required a massive search of the fields. The Chualar one was at least 400 feet wide, more than 5 feet tall, and it was also clearly visible for two hours before anybody bothered to take a picture or video of it.So it's not a hoax, or a clever attempt to draw attention to themselves. According to the local newspaper, the Chualar Patch, no, it's a real circle, with the letters "R.P.C." painted on the surface in white acrylic paint. No, the Chualar circle isn't a crop circle, it's a crop circle superceded. The crop circle in Siena was just a few years old, and this one was created a decade or more ago. The Siena circle was so big that it was eventually abandoned by the local farmers, and replaced with a different crop circle.It is, as its originator, Michael Burdett, told me in an email, "a perfectly natural circle, the first real crop circle I think I've seen, to the best of my knowledge. But that didn't stop it being noticed as soon as it was discovered."I asked Burdett how he knew what the Chualar circle was really about. He wrote, "I have been following crop circles for decades. It was not until after they were publicized that I knew what the significance was. There was no crop circle in Chualar for 20 years or more that any farmer had talked about. They all used the word as a vague description, a vague joke. What actually happened in Chualar was never revealed at all. As it was not a hoax, it is impossible to explain. I just never thought of a real origin for it, but the more I read about it, the more I thought, 'I get it now.'"I asked Burdett	0
In recent days, Bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one Bitcoin jumped on several Bitcoin exchanges to more than $200 per Bitcoin. But by Wednesday, it fell to $105. Bitcoins are an attempt at creating an electronic currency that is beyond the control of any government. They are created through a digital mining system, in which digital "miners" are granted Bitcoins by using their computers to do computations that verify Bitcoin transactions.  Pretty clever. With allegedly strict rules on the creation of Bitcoins, the money supply is limited. Theoretically, no government can water down the Bitcoin with any type of quantitative easing. As a result, Bitcoins seem to present the best of all possible worlds -- the convenience of modern digital payment technology and the stability of a fixed money supply. Fearmongers point out that banks are no longer safe as government authorities in the European Union have signaled their willingness to confiscate funds from even insured depositors. Those fearing the collapse of their local currency or their local banking system won't have to lug around hunks of metal as a way to store their wealth. Why not turn to Bitcoins? The near anonymity built into the Bitcoin system keeps funds away from the prying eyes of tax collectors, who are getting ever better at shutting down tax havens. This potential for anonymity makes the currency ideal for drug smugglers, terrorists and money launderers, as well as the merely paranoid. So are Bitcoins the currency of the future?  I think not. No one really knows who is really behind Bitcoins, as the creator is just a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. That in itself should be a huge red flag. I would certainly not trust my life savings to some mysterious computer algorithm created by shadowy anonymous characters in a system that attracts underworld types. One of the self-proclaimed largest Bitcoin exchanges is Mt. Gox. The name originally stood for Magic: The Gathering Exchange, an online site designed to trade cards used in playing the card game popular with the younger set. An exchange based on trading kiddy cards does not seem like a sound foundation for a monetary system. There is no government regulating participants in the system to prevent fraud and abuse. I would not be surprised if the Bitcoin mining software becomes a magnet for computer viruses.  After all, the tax evaders, drug dealers and terrorists attracted to Bitcoin would not be likely to cooperate with authorities when they have been hacked and robbed.	1
There's been a sharp spike in radiation levels measured in the pipes and containers holding water at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan. But the company in charge of cleaning it up says that only a ~~5~~ percent increase in radiation levels is to be attributed to that accident in 2011.The new report by the Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) is part of a broader attempt to explain why more than 300,000 people died from a meltdown at the plant in March 2011 and how the company took so long to clean up the mess.In November, TEPCO issued a somewhat more robust explanation of what happened at Fukushima, which in some ways is better than its original public statement on the accident in 2011.TEPCO says that a small amount of radiation was released from the damaged facility, which damaged equipment and contaminated the water as it escaped from the damaged reactors. TEPCO's statement didn't mention the melted spent fuel containers—which contain almost all of the radioactive material that caused the disaster—or the huge volume of contaminated water that leaked out and filled the sea.The company says that the radiation released from a damaged reactor is normally absorbed by the water in the tanks holding the spent fuel. They aren't leaking out because they aren't hot, but because the walls have cooled and the fuel has solidified, as has the water. Since the tanks contain fuel assemblies instead of fuel rods, they were exposed to a much lower level of radiation than the fuel rods in rods.The company also says that even if all of that radiation escaped from a damaged reactor and could have been detected, nothing would have happened.The water used to cool the reactors for safety reasons is used to cool the spent fuel, which is in molten form and would have vaporized if it had reached the surface faster than it was being cooled. The damage to the containment vessels, caused by the explosion, is what made it necessary to cool the fuel and to prevent it from exploding. The water in the tanks holding spent fuel is used to cool the fuel in the storage pools.It's that cooling of the spent fuel that is likely to be the cause of the sharp spike in radiation levels measured at the plants. The fuel rods were cooled by the water in their tanks and then the fuel, once it solidified, was cooled directly by the water in the pools.Spent fuel from Fukushima's three reactors has been	0
The unsolved murder of human rights activists in Russia. Their detention, torture and murder in Iran. Their jailing in China and Vietnam. Attacks on journalists in the Philippines, Pakistan, Mexico and Somalia. Coups in Africa and Central America. All isolated incidents around the world that together made 2009 a grim milestone in world freedom, according to a United States think tank that tracks liberty around the globe. Declines in freedom around the world outweighed gains last year, for the fourth year in a row, Freedom House says in its annual survey published Tuesday. "This represents the longest continuous period of deterioration in the nearly 40-year history" of the report, writes this year's author, Arch Puddington. There were only 116 electoral democracies around the world in 2009, the group found -- the lowest number since 1995. But the world is doing relatively well at democratic elections, compared with some other indicators. "Governments are more likely to permit relatively honest elections than to allow an uncensored press, a robust civil society, and an independent judiciary," Puddington writes. The report is not all doom and gloom. There was progress in Iraq, the Balkans, Malawi and Togo, Freedom House said. And taking the long view, the world was more free in 2009 than when revolutions swept the communist world 20 years earlier. The Central and Eastern European democracies born in 1989 have largely retained their freedom, despite economic pressures stemming from the worldwide recession. But much of the former Soviet Union is in a dire state. Central Asia is the least free region in the world, according to Freedom House, and contains two of the nine countries that got the survey's "worst of the worst" rating. Central Asia's former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are on that list, along with North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea and Somalia. Ten other countries and territories fared only slightly better. They are Belarus, Chad, China, Cuba, Guinea, Laos, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia, and Western Sahara, which is fighting for independence from Morocco. Freedom House groups countries into three categories: free, partly free and not free. A total of 89 countries were rated free in 2009. That's 46 percent of the 194 countries and territories in the survey, representing 46 percent of the world's population.	1
The music was pounding, the lights pulsing. The concertgoers, who packed the club, were rocking with wild abandon to the sound of the band on stage. But the party quickly turned to horror as flames sparked by pyrotechnics swept up the walls and across the ceiling. This wasn't the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil, where more than 230 souls lost their lives Sunday. It was The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, where 100 were killed during a show by '80s heavy metal band Great White. For survivors of that February night fire in 2003, the Sunday blaze in Santa Maria brought back memories of their own brush with death. Photos: Hundreds dead in Brazil nightclub fire "I can't help but watch because I'm one of them," Gina Russo told CNN affiliate WPRI-TV. "It's just devastating that someone else has to experience it." Russo suffered serious burns in the fire, but the flames claimed the life of her fiance, Fred Crisostomi. A sad sense of deja vu In the years since the blaze, Station fire survivors have felt the same sadness numerous times: In December 2004, when 194 people were killed in a nightclub fire in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires; In December 2008, when fireworks triggered a fire and panic at a nightclub in Perm, Russia, killing 156 people; And in January 2009, when a New Year's Eve blaze at a Bangkok club claimed 64 lives. Now, the reality of another such tragedy tears at the heart of Dave Kane, whose 18-year-old son Nicky was the youngest victim of the Station fire. "It hasn't stopped. Nobody has learned anything," he told CNN affiliate WJAR-TV. "What else do you need to get through to somebody? I don't know what that is." Sunday, The Station Fire Memorial Foundation offered its condolences and sympathies to those affected by the fire in Brazil. "The loss of life and injuries sustained are almost too heartbreaking to comprehend," a statement from the organization said. "One cannot help but notice the similarities between this tragedy and the Station nightclub fire that occurred nearly ten years ago."

A prominent group of Muslim American and Christian leaders are scheduled to return to Washington Monday, following a six day visit to Iran where top government and clerical officials indicated to them that two American hikers would be released. "Our goal has been to foster interfaith ties, build a system of understanding and ask the Iranian leadership to show compassion and mercy for the American hikers by allowing them to come home," said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) who went to Tehran last week as part of a religious delegation. The American delegation included Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, the Rt. Rev. John Bryson Chane, Episcopal Bishop of Washington, and Interim Dean of Washington National Cathedral, and former North Carolina State Sen. Larry Shaw, said Awad. "The delegation was informed by the Iranian authorities that its work prior to this trip and during its current stay in Iran was very helpful and important in the decision to release the hikers," according to a CAIR statement released Sunday. Awad told CNN the delegation traveled to Tehran at the invitation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The appeal for the release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal began with a series of personal letters addressed to Ahmadinejad and other Iranian leaders in September 2010, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. In May, boxing legend Muhammad Ali joined more than a dozen prominent Muslim American and various interfaith leaders -- including CAIR -- at a news conference in Washington to publicly ask for the release of the two hikers. Their appeal to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khameni, was endorsed by the group, which has maintained a dialogue with clerical leaders in Iran, said Awad. Last week, Awad and three other members of the delegation, boarded a flight to Tehran with a stop in Istanbul, Turkey. Their visit this week included meetings with Iranian religious scholars and leaders in the holy city of Qom and a meeting on Saturday with Ahmadinejad, said Awad. "We can only hope the two men are freed soon on humanitarian grounds and that our visit fosters a better dialogue between Iranian and American leaders of faith," he said. The delegation was granted permission by government officials to visit Baur and Fattal in prison on Sunday but their request was postponed, said Awad.	1
The National Transportation Safety Board will assist the South Korean government in investigating the crash of an Asiana Airlines cargo plane, officials said Friday. Asiana Flight 991, a Boeing 747-400F cargo airplane, went down Thursday near the southern South Korean island of Jeju, where parts of the plane were found but not the aircraft itself. The two pilots are believed to have been killed, the safety board said in a statement. The plane crashed around 4:12 a.m. en route from Seoul's Incheon International Airport to Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China, the NTSB said. The flight crew reportedly declared an emergency due to an in-flight fire, the board said. The plane crashed into the East China Sea about 70 miles west of Jeju Island, the NTSB said. U.S. officials have designated air safety investigator John Lovell as the NTSB representative, to be joined by an NTSB operational factors investigator and advisors from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the safety board said. The Korea Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board is leading the probe, the U.S. safety board said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.	1
If you use mobile data services outside your wireless carrier's network coverage area, you could get a nasty surprise in your bill. Data-roaming charges can be outrageously expensive, even totaling thousands of dollars in a single month. Also, carriers often don't make it obvious to phone users when and where data-roaming fees might apply, or how fast they can add up. But that could be changing. At its December open meeting, the Federal Communications Commission may vote on a proposed rule that would mandate automatic data-roaming agreements between carriers and address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service. In April, the FCC ordered all wireless carriers to automatically allow voice calls to roam across networks. The data-roaming proposal would do the same for data traffic, i.e. mobile Web surfing, running apps and other actions. The stakes here are much higher than just data-roaming charges. Network neutrality -- the contentious principle that broadband providers should maintain equal Web access to all and not offer favorable delivery speeds to certain clients -- may be at stake with this vote. Recently, Politico's Kim Hart explained: "The debate is the latest skirmish in the larger battle over broadband reclassification. To impose the rule, the FCC would need to change the legal framework that governs broadband services -- an idea pushed by net neutrality advocates but vehemently opposed by many Republicans and internet providers. ... Enacting a data-roaming rule would be politically expedient for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, who has faced legal setbacks in his quest to make wireless networks more open." The two largest U.S. carriers -- Verizon and AT&T, which together serve over 60 percent of U.S. mobile subscribers -- strenuously oppose this move. These carriers claim they already have negotiated dozens of data-roaming agreements with smaller carriers. According to Fierce Wireless, "The arguments by the nation's largest operators stand in stark contrast to filings by smaller wireless carriers, which argue the FCC should mandate automatic data roaming as it has already done with voice calling -- an effort intended to give smaller carriers a chance to compete against larger operators." The carriers also have a more fundamental objection to the proposed data-roaming rule: They claim the FCC does not have the authority to regulate the data side of their business.	1
Gaze across the Riyadh skyline and one building immediately demands your attention. Towering high above the city, with its distinctive inverted arch, is the 992 ft Kingdom Center -- owned by the richest man in Saudi Arabia, if Ã¢ÂÂ¦The Kingdom Center, the world&#8217t most expensive shopping center in the world, known as Burj al-Arab, is on the horizon, and what do we find there? The center&#8217s most recent high rise offers the worldÃ¢ÂÂs highest indoor skylines, where the lights never go out.Burj al-Arab, formerly named Kingdom Center, was designed by legendary American architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), and was constructed between 1978 and 1982. The building is considered one of SOMÃ¢ÂÂs masterpieces and is considered a global symbol of modern architecture.As you walk over to one of the first floors, you will notice that each piece feels like an individual sculpture that is in tune with the other individual pieces. The space between each and every piece feels like a space for creativity and wonder.These sculptures serve as a metaphor for life in the Kingdom, where a new sense of individuality and cohesiveness has taken hold of the young and old alike. And while the skyscraper&#8217s name was changed from Kingdom Center to Burj al-Arab, the concept is similar to the original concept of the building, which was named Kingdom Center.The Kingdom Center is an 11 story highrise situated atop a 1,000 ft high podium area. Burj al-Arab is an open, glass and steel building, with an atrium as the central core.The building&#8217s core rests on the podium area which occupies a small valley at the center of the building. In this valley, the atrium opens up as an oasis of greenery and sunlight. This means that all the apartments overlook the atrium of the building, which is the focal point of the building.The atrium consists of two floor open areas that offer a panoramic view of Riyadh.

Outside my window, the wind is starting to die down, although it still comes through in gusts, sending branches and debris tumbling down the deserted street outside. The power's been out since 4 a.m. Life has skidded to a slow crawl, with no data available on my smartphone and no Internet to tell me when the storm might subside. It's just me inside my shelter, listening to the howl of the weather and racing to eat everything in the fridge before it spoils and has to be tossed into a garbage bag. Some people in New Orleans party before a storm starts or even after it begins. Young voices hollered and whooped down the street last night, kids running through the rain with bottles in their hands. In the meantime, I stood on the porch as the wind started to pick up. Waiting. Hurricane Isaac photos Luckily, I made sure to charge up all my laptops before the power went out. In the dark, I sit in front of a rectangular glowing screen, a reminder that my separation from technology is only temporary until someone comes and repairs the lines. Soon, I'll be connected to the world again. For now, I send texts from time to time, just to make sure others are OK, to let them know I am thinking of them as we sit in the darkness listening to the world outside. Some might describe the feeling that comes with waiting for a hurricane to arrive as fear, anxiety or anger. To me, it's not quite any of those things. It's closer to surrender. Growing up, my grandmother told me stories of Hurricane Betsy that engraved themselves on my memory. In their home on Desire Street in the Ninth Ward, they stayed put when they heard that weather was coming, with none of the advanced ways to communicate about the threat of a storm that we have now. New Orleans: The food that got them through When Betsy hit in 1965, my grandmother watched as the floodwaters gushed from the floor furnace in the hallway of their home, spilling across the living room floor. I listened, frozen in awe, as she described to me those first moments of panic, how everyone stood there and watched it, the long seconds before my mother screamed with fear.	1
Leading figures in the world of soccer, including superstar David Beckham, on Thursday blasted FIFA President Sepp Blatter for controversial remarks he made on racism in an interview with CNN World Sport. The head of world football told CNN's Pedro Pinto there is no on-field racism in football and that any player who has been abused should simply shake hands with his opponent at the end of the match and move on. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, a former England captain, expressed his outrage on Twitter, blasting Blatter's comments as "so condescending it's almost laughable." "I think the remarks were appalling, personally," Beckham said in an interview with CNN's Paul Vercammen. "All I care about is keeping racism out of soccer and out of sport. Because it's not just in sports it's in life in general. So it has to be stopped and we're part of that." Beckham, who plays in the United States for LA Galaxy, said something should be done, but he stopped short of saying Blatter should step down. Pedro Pinto: My crazy day with Sepp The chief executive of England's Professional Footballers' Association, Gordon Taylor, told CNN that Blatter should quit. "He should step down," he said. "This is the straw that broke the camel's back. We need football to set a good example, so this is inexcusable. The Swiss was re-elected unopposed as the head of football's governing body in June after his main rival was suspended amid corruption allegations. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was also dogged by bribery allegations. Soon after Blatter gave his interview to CNN on Wednesday, his position appeared to be undermined when the English Football Association charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez with racism toward a fellow player. Suarez allegedly taunted Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. Suarez, from Uruguay, denies the claims. London's Metropolitan Police are also investigating allegations of racism against Chelsea and England captain John Terry. He denies claims he racially abused the brother of Rio Ferdinand, Anton, during a Premier League match. Blatter: No on-field racism in football The UK sports minister Hugh Robertson echoed calls for Blatter to quit. "Racism is a criminal offense in this country and anybody who is caught will face criminal sanctions," he told CNN.	1
To promote her Fox comedy "Raising Hope" (which begins its third season October 2), Martha Plimpton pitched a funny idea. "People are always trying to come up with creative ways of engaging the viewers," she tells EW. "And I thought well, I play a housekeeper on a show, what if I went and cleaned the house of "Raising Hope's" biggest fan. In my uniform." The network thought she was joking, but she was serious. The contest begins today at www.fox.com/cleansweep. Through October 8, fans can enter by submitting their best "Awkward Family Photo" and a paragraph stating why their family is just like the Chance family and why they deserve a house call from Martha and her TV husband Garret Dillahunt. Yes, he's coming along to, to make like his character and mow the winner's lawn. (And okay, they'll have professional crews there to help them.) "Raising Hope" creator Greg Garcia will select the winner from the top 10 finalists in mid-October, and Plimpton and Dillahunt will get their hands dirty later that month or in early November. Entertainment Weekly: What does this say about your commitment to promoting your show? Martha Plimpton: Well, I think it says a lot about my commitment to promoting the show. [Laughs] It's a funny thing: A lot of people who haven't seen the show yet say they haven't watched because they're not really sure what it is. They think it's about a baby, or that it's extremely dumb or something. But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize. The writing is very, very sharp. If dare I say it, it's a lot more sophisticated underneath. [Laughs] Do you know what I mean? The exterior is really ridiculous and silly, but there's real sophistication in the writing, and I'm really proud to be a part of it. And I think it's really smart, and it makes me laugh. If it makes me laugh, well, I'm sorry, but then it must be good. [Laughs] Because I don't laugh at a lot of things. I'm thrilled that we got a third season. I very much would like for people to enjoy this show as much as I do. I want to share it with the largest amount of people I can. And I will do what is necessary.	1
U.S. star Jozy Altidore has said he will "pray" for those who subjected him to racist abuse during a Dutch cup game Tuesday. The 23-year-old American international was the target of racist chanting during AZ Alkmaar's 5-0 win at nine-man Den Bosch. Referee Reinold Wiedemeijer suspended the game during the first half following "jungle sounds chanted at Altidore," according to AZ's official twitter feed. But AZ players, including Altidore, persuaded him not to. Wiedemeijer asked host club Den Bosch to put a message over the public address system, warning the crowd he would stop the match if the abuse carried on. The contest was also briefly stopped after the interval after home fans threw snowballs at the linesmen. Time for football to tackle racism epidemic? Altidore was adamant the game should not be stopped and in a post-match interview with Dutch television he explained his stance. He said: "It's a bit disappointing that these things still happen at this time but what are you going to do? "You just have to hope that these people find a way to improve themselves. You can only pray for them. "I feel like as a football player that I have an obligation, to my team, to my club, to my family to not react to things like this. "I want to show them that club stands better than that and that I was raised better than that than respond to such ridiculous behaviour. "It's a bit disappointing because you would hope as human beings that humanity can grow from these types of times. "But at the end of the day, it's still alive racism and all we can do is try and educate ourselves and the young kids coming up to be better than that. "All I can do is pray for them and hope they become better people." FIFA ready to hit racists hard Altidore, who scored from the penalty spot during the contest, also insisted he would not rise to those who had insulted him from the stands. He added: "I'm not going to fight them. They just have some issues and need some help. You can only pray for them and hope they get better. "We were in a good rhythm and it was important for us to keep going. I think we started the New Year right and you have to look at the bigger picture."	1
Sen. Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, says he is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgrateful that the Senate has chosen to bring this matter before them for further review.Ã¢â‚¬ÂWASHINGTON - After a week of sometimes intense hearings, the U.S. Senate will hold a final vote on whether to approve the nomination of Richard L. Gephardt, the former Democratic floor leader from Missouri, to the U.S. Senate Post Office.Gephardt, who is nominated by President Clinton for his ninth postmaster general, is expected to be confirmed easily.Gephardt is expected to receive strong support among senators, including Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wis., whose opposition to the nomination was the only reason he voted against the appointment.Gephardt was nominated by President Clinton in 1995 for an unexpired term, but Republican senators would have been able to block his confirmation because the Senate has not taken action on his nomination since that time.At his news conference Tuesday, President Clinton said he expects Gephardt to be confirmed by the Senate.The House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, has taken no actions on Gephardt's nomination since 1995 and has not held a confirmation hearing since 1985.He said Tuesday that he hoped he would be able to be confirmed by the Senate.Asked whether he would still be able to use his Senate postmaster post if Gephardt was confirmed, the president said, "That would be a fine thing."Gephardt, 47, said he would have to determine on his own whether he wanted to stay in Congress and take up other work on the Hill.He spent more than 30 years in the Senate, including 24 years as its secretary before becoming the leader of its bipartisan body in the early 1990s. As chairman, he helped craft a bipartisan bill to stem a tide of layoffs at the Post Office.Gephardt came to Washington from Missouri in 1995, where he served as its lieutenant governor during the administration of Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died in 1999 and whom he had accompanied to Washington when he was named Postmaster General in 1983.

Sin Hwa Dee began operations in the 1970s as a cottage industry in the former soya sauce-producing enclave of Kim Chuan Road, in the Paya Lebar area of Singapore. Mr. and Mrs. Chng Kee  had first established their business in 1972 when Mr. Chng Kee  ran a food stall on Kim Chuan Road, but a few years later Mrs. Chng Kee established a similar business in the small shop in the nearby Tampines Shopping Centre. This business was later sold by Mrs. Chng Kee to her husband. In 1989, Mr. Chng Kee  opened an  ice cream shop in the same shopping centre and in 1998, Mr and Mrs. Chng Kee  established their first gelato shop next to it. They also opened a second shop and an ice-cream parlour at the corner of Jalan Paya Lebar and Orchard Road in 2000. One year later, Mrs. Chng Kee  started an  fruit juice shop  on Taman Paya Lebar Street in front of their shop at the corner of Jalan Paya Lebar and Orchard Road. They have now expanded their business to other neighbouring areas like Tampines and Jalan Besar. In the meantime, Mrs. Chng Kee continues to manage her business in her two shops, with the aim of being the first female-owned business in Tampines. (Note: Mrs. Chng Kee  also manages her husband's  fish stall. She is the sole shoplady behind that business, which opened in 2002)In 2000, Paya Lebar Street had a high crime rate, with numerous burglaries and robberies taking place. However, the business in Paya Lebar Street was already beginning to grow as a result of the increase in population in the area. As a result, Paya Lebar Street was chosen as the location for a new shopping mall to be called  UPLM which was officially opened on 18 February 2010. The mall has more than 100 stores, including two department stores, two food stores, a supermarket, a movie theatre, a pharmacy, a medical centre, a bank and many cafes and eateries.EtymologyThe name Paya Lebar () literally means 'The Bridge of the Pregnant Woman'.NeighbourhoodsThe central part of the Paya Lebar Street shopping area is known as  Paya Lebar Central	0
Much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today, enamored by the Duchess of Cambridge's very being, I was similarly captivated by Diana, Princess of Wales when I was a youngster. She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million. Of course that was long before the, "there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy. I simply adored her ... I still do. As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate. Girls' names are causing the biggest stir, as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess. If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one. In choosing a name, titled royals tend to turn to the family tree, rather than a well-thumbed copy of "1,001 Best Baby Names" like the rest of us. Traditionally they pick dynastic names, and there are plenty to choose from: Elizabeth, Alice, Victoria and Charlotte have all been frontrunners, but the sentimental favorite among punters remains Diana. In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice. That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana. Today Diana's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself: while some have virtually sainted her, others have been vehemently critical, accusing her of being childish, unhinged and self-serving. Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy.	1
Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars. The list was based on five different criteria.Criteria: The car should have at least 25 million cars sold in the past three decades.In that time frame, must have sold the total quantity of cars: at least 100,000 cars per year.Must be a company with a history of being strong in the automotive industry.Not a brand new car and not a mass market car with low volume. The list included a number of cars in all stages of their life cycle and the results were surprising. Car of the generation was the Mitsubishi Galant introduced in 1980. If you were a young teen in 1980, who went out for that first drive on your new Mitsubishi Galant, how would you like your first impression on that car?A:The first car I ever got to buy was a Ford Taurus. I thought it was quite a good buy at the time.I used to work at the Ford Motor Company during the 1960s—and I was a teenager at that.I used my own money to buy my first car in 1959. A Buick LeSabre with the "19" designation on the hood!I had a new Chevrolet Chevelle, with a 350 V8 and a "5" tag on the hood. Good for just 12,000 miles.From my memory, I had driven a Buick LeSabre and an Olds, while listening to the radio.  In 1965, I was sixteen, and I took my first delivery of a Porsche 356 Carrera in Geneva, Switzerland.I had a Corvette just after that and before joining Ford in 1969. Both of them were quite expensive. I had the same Corvette for a few months in the 1980s, when I bought it for $20,000.It is important, however, to realize that "popularity" is a relative term. A Toyota Corolla was very popular in the 1960s, as were the Honda Prelude and Civic. The car in the question is a great example of a "perfect" car that is also rather bland. It's like an iPhone without a camera app.All-	0
Football is part of the lifeblood of the people of Brazil, who have seen their heroes lift the FIFA World Cup a record five times since 1958. From the legendary Pele, who inspired that initial success in Sweden and also played in the 1962 and 1970 winning teams, through to the eras of Romario, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, ordinary Brazilians have delighted in their exploits. Because Brazil's "Samba Boys" don't just win, they win in style, capturing the imagination of a population often struggling with poverty and inequality. "I would say it is all about the joy football brings," Manchester United's Brazilian star Anderson told CNN. "It's about the children who maybe don't have enough food at home, who don't have a dad or a mum, but they go outside to play football even with bare feet and they feel joy and happiness to do it. It happened to me and many of my friends when we were growing up. "Football helps a lot of people in Brazil. If you took football away from Brazilians, you would be affecting the nation's heart." A rocky road to Rio and the 2014 World Cup? That's why it's a matter of some national concern that Brazil, a football-mad country with a seemingly neverending conveyor belt of talent, has never won the Olympic tournament -- not with its men, or its also highly-talented women. And with Brazil hosting the 2014 World Cup, and the Olympics two years after that, the pressure is on. The 2008 Beijing Games provided the latest disappointments, with a men's team sporting the likes of two-time world player of the year Ronaldinho and future AC Milan star Alexandre Pato crashing out in the semifinals to Argentina, losing 3-0 and ending up with the bronze medal. The women's side, including five-time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta, had to settle for silver for the second straight Olympics. Work and play - Brazil's samba star Neymar has it all Midfielder Anderson, who played in the Argentina match, admits that the failure hurt -- and not just because Brazil's South American archrivals went on to claim the gold medal for the second successive time. "We had hoped to win the gold medal because we had great players like Ronaldinho, Pato ... I was there, other stars as well, but we couldn't do it," he said.	1
A federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of New York City firefighters. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said the city needs "to comprehensively reassess its policies and personnel practices in race and gender."The decision, issued this morning, marks the first of many legal and other challenges to Mayor de Blasio and the city's top civil service officials on the topic of discrimination in the New York Fire Department.The Civil Service Commission is the only agency in the city that is authorized to carry out Title VII and other employment discrimination lawsuits. But in the past, the commission has been accused of being slow to respond to those complaints. In 2014, the commission settled a lawsuit with New York's Office of the Mayor, which had been investigating complaints of discrimination against firefighters and claiming that the city was unlawfully using the city's budgeted overtime pay.The commissioner for personnel, Cynthia Stroum, is not being replaced, and she will continue to handle cases of discrimination on her own.The monitor will be paid $165,000 annually for three years, according to court documents filed on Monday and made public. That number, however, is just a placeholder. He or she will get a monthly retainer, with the city having no control over that. It's unclear how the monitor will receive an annual bonus from the city.Judge Garaufis wrote in his order that "the Mayor and the Commissioner of Personnel need to make and enforce a comprehensive remedial plan to address the issue of discrimination in the New York Fire Department and ensure that such discrimination does not occur again" and that he hopes the city does this by the end of the year.The monitor also needs to develop a plan for a permanent monitoring system to prevent discrimination, including an annual review of personnel records and a system to record complaints of discrimination against firefighters, according to the order.In July, Mayor de Blasio announced the formation of a council committee to review the city's hiring policies regarding the Department of Correction. The committee will be made up of seven appointees, four of whom are current civil service commissioners and three who will be appointed by de Blasio himself. The committee's mission will be to "advance the Commission's mandate to ensure that the Commission and the City's civil service laws are applied effectively and fairly across all agencies of the government, including the Correction Department."	0
Late one night, after dark, we met up with Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, an NGO fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at Cambodia's KTVs: karaoke clubs  where a boy could earn about $3 per night.We were just beginning to get to know people like Mr. Brewster. To take him as an example of the sort of NGO worker that Cambodia needs to continue its fight against the commercialization of young girls.After getting to know Cambodia, I began to notice that this war was not a war on sex trafficking, but a war against poverty. And the battle is just beginning.And so, while I was traveling around Cambodia, I began to feel that what I was doing was important work. Not only was I trying to help girls like the one I was staying with, I was also helping people understand that Cambodia is a very poor country, and that there needed to be some help there.While at Cambodia, I found out that many people there have a deep and sincere love and concern for the girls they work with. This is something that I will carry with me, in my heart, always.This week I returned to Cambodia with a friend. We were able to visit the girl's home, sit down with her family, and also talk with her. I was saddened that after we visited her home, the people who lived and worked with her did not want us to stay with the children in the home.And though I tried to stay strong and continue to let them know that Cambodia is changing for the better, this small interaction with these girls was enough to make me feel that we are all doing exactly what we should be doing. And that we should not give up. We need to continue to fight for girls like them.When my friend and I arrived back in Phnom Penh, I immediately set out to visit Agape International Missions, headed by Don Brewster.Don came to the hotel where I was staying, and we went for a little tour around his headquarters. We visited his office and spoke with the staff, then Don took us to an adjoining room, which was packed with children running everywhere. A room where kids were being taught a song that was sung throughout the country. (And I have to wonder why the song was sung everywhere?)We watched the children's song and asked Don if he	0
I'm looking forward to Thursday night's installment of CNN's "The Sixties" with some trepidation. True, it's another excellent installment in the series. Capturing the highlights and essence of a decade, especially one as turbulent and historically significant as the '60s, is not easy. Given the controversial nature of many of the events -- at the time and even today -- and given how much influence some of those movements and events still exert, the task of putting together even a multipart series is daunting. Thursday's episode will cover the 1968 assassinations of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4, and of Bobby Kennedy, on June 5. Other episodes will cover the beginnings of the gay rights movement -- the Stonewall riots -- and the emergence of the women's rights movement. Those events changed my life, immediately. Those movements changed the way I saw the world, eventually. I was born on December 15, 1959 -- the cusp of the '60s. As the baby boomers came of age, or at least entered their teens, I went from infancy, to being a toddler, to childhood. I have no direct memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK's assassination, the Beatles coming to America, or the buildup of the Vietnam War. "I Have A Dream" was my dream -- it still is, of course -- but I learned the words in reruns. But I was old enough to be affected directly by the events in this episode. As I wrote in "Cooking With Grease," I grew up on April 4, 1968, when Martin Luther King was shot. I'd been active in neighborhood politics even before, but that night, at 9 years old, I joined the civil rights movement. I had no choice. None of us did. When Bobby Kennedy was assassinated two months later, we prayed. I remember praying. I remember my anger, my fear, my determination. I remember talking to everyone I trusted, everyone I thought wise. The times indeed were changing, but nobody knew what they were changing into. Our challenge was channeling anger into action, transforming despair into determination, using defeat to become more disciplined. I learned early it's a lifetime challenge. While the civil rights movement was woven into my childhood, it took a bit longer for me to become aware of what was then called the women's liberation movement.	1
Computer technicians have recovered about 22 million Bush administration e-mails that the Bush White House had said were missing, two watchdog groups that sued over the documents announced Monday. The e-mails date from 2003 to 2005, and had been "mislabeled and effectively lost," according to the National Security Archive, a research group based at George Washington University. But Melanie Sloan, executive director of the liberal-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it could be years before most of the e-mails are made public. "The e-mails themselves are not what we're getting," Sloan said. Documents related to the handling of e-mail under the Bush administration and subsequent information regarding how White House e-mails are currently archived will be released under a settlement with the Obama administration, which inherited a lawsuit the groups filed in 2007. But the National Archives must sort out which documents are covered by the Freedom of Information Act and which ones fall under the Presidential Records Act, which means they could be withheld for five to 10 years after the Bush administration left office in January, Sloan said. "The National Archives will sort this out," she said. The e-mail controversy dates back to the Bush administration's 2006 firing of the top federal prosecutors in nine cities. After congressional committees demanded the administration produce documents related to the firings, the White House said millions of e-mails might have been lost from its servers. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive sued over the issue in 2007, arguing the Bush administration violated federal laws that require presidential records to be preserved. Court records have shown that the Bush administration knew about the e-mail problems as far back as 2005 and did nothing to fix them, Sloan said. "They never made an effort to restore them," she said. But Scott Stanzel, a former deputy press secretary in the Bush White House, said the group "has consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard IT issues." "We always indicated that there is an e-mail archiving system and a disaster recovery system," Stanzel said. "We also indicated that e-mails not properly archived could be found on disaster recovery tapes. There is a big, big difference between something not being properly archived and it being 'lost' or 'missing,' as CREW would say."	1
HP has announced a major new initiative and a slew of new devices that enable users to print from any device to a web-enabled printer by simply using e-mail. The idea -- which builds off the Google Cloud Print announcement we saw back in April -- starts with giving each printer its own unique e-mail address. That printer's owner (and their designated family, friends, and colleagues) can then print documents by sending it an email from a smartphone, from a tablet, or any other device that allows it. Called HP ePrint, the technology eliminates the need for installing drivers and enables a variety of new apps and services. Putting Documents in the Cloud The new printers that HP is unveiling today along with ePrint can connect directly to Google Cloud using their touchscreen interface. That means users can print Google Docs directly from the cloud without using their desktop computer, as well as scan documents directly to their Google Docs account. Other Google services like Calendar and Picasa for photos are also supported. Similarly, Box.net and Docstoc users can also retrieve and push documents to and from the cloud through new print apps. A New Opportunity for Publishers Another area HP is exploring with the ePrint concept is scheduled delivery. This allows users to get content printed at specific times -- for example, getting a customized daily newspaper printed out every morning that they can take with them on the train. MSNBC has signed on as a partner to pilot this concept, and HP has teamed with Yahoo to sell the ads, which, you can imagine could include a mix of contextual advertising and locally relevant promotions and coupons. Another Platform for Developers Beyond productivity and news, initial apps include Facebook for printing photos and events and MapQuest for printing maps and directions. HP also sees a big opportunity for providing different types of activities for parents and kids, and to that end has signed on Crayola for coloring pages and PBS for a variety of education-driven printing. As for the market size for developers here, HP says it expects to ship, "tens of millions of web-connected printers" by the end of next year. Currently, developers interested in building apps need to apply for access to HP's SDK. Why's HP Doing This? Beyond selling printers, HP needs to sell ink. With more and more types of documents getting digitized and smartphones replacing former functions of printers (think coupons and tickets), HP needs new ways to drive printer usage.	1
Archie Manning: Super Bowl XLIV is Sunday in Miami, Florida. The New Orleans Saints will face the Indianapolis Colts, and it's the first time the Saints have been in the Super Bowl in the team's four-decade history. Archie Manning is in an interesting situation. The quarterback was drafted by the Saints in 1971, and was hands-down the most famous and revered Saint, staying with them for ten years. He still has a home in New Orleans, Louisiana. Now his son, Peyton Manning, quarterback of the Colts, will face his father's old team, the team he grew up rooting for. Archie Manning and his wife, Olivia, raised three football-playing sons. Cooper, an all-state high school wide receiver and now a partner in an investment firm; Eli, who led the New York Giants to their Super Bowl win two years ago; and Peyton, who did the same for the Colts the year before that. Eli and Peyton both won MVP awards. A few weeks ago, Mike Chappell in the Indianapolis Star reported that Archie Manning said he plans to root for the Colts. "I'm going to pull for my son," Archie said. "(Saints coach) Sean Payton knows that. He's a great friend of mine. (Saints quarterback) Drew Brees knows that. That's just the way it is. Anybody who thinks it's different must not have children." Indy Star: Saints legend Archie Manning pulling for son, Colts Robert Park: North Korea said Friday it was releasing the Korean-American missionary detained after reportedly illegally entering the country in December, state-run media reported. Tyong Park, Robert Park's father, said in San Diego, California, that he was "so excited" by the news but had no other information about his son's release. Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of "Christ's love and forgiveness" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. After an investigation, North Korean authorities "decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrong doings into consideration," the state-run Korea Central News Agency said.	1
A court Thursday rejected an appeal filed by a former administrative law judge who sued a dry cleaners for $54 million over a missing pair of pants. An unidentified man talks on a cell phone in front of the Chung family's shop, Custom Cleaners. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals "ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson's appeal of the case completely," said Christopher Manning, an attorney for the Chung family, who own Custom Cleaners. "The D.C. Court of Appeals held that the trial court correctly ruled that Mr. Pearson's claims had no merit whatsoever," he added. The Chungs have "some level of relief," Manning told CNN, "but they won't count Mr. Pearson out for at least trying to torment them further" with future appeals. "We are very happy with the result and thank everyone for supporting us," Jin Chung said in a statement issued by Manning. "The past three years have been very difficult, but we hope this nightmare is finally over." Pearson initially sought $67 million from the Chungs, calculating the amount by estimating years of legal violations, adding nearly $2 million in common law claims for fraud. The saga began in May 2005, when Pearson took several pairs of pants to Custom Cleaners for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge. He alleged that among them was a pair of pants from a blue and maroon suit. When he came to collect his clothing, he said, the Chungs tried to give him a pair of charcoal gray pants that were not his. During a two-day trial, Pearson, who represented himself, said that when he took the pants to the cleaners, his financial situation was precarious: He had just been ordered to pay $12,000 in attorney's fees to his ex-wife, and his credit cards were at their limit. He claimed millions of dollars in attorney fees and millions more in punitive damages for what he called fraudulent advertising under the law. He also claimed that a sign in the store's window promising "satisfaction guaranteed" was an unconditional warranty that required the defendants to honor any claim by any customer without limitation. The Chungs' attorney argued that no reasonable person would interpret the signs to mean an unconditional promise of satisfaction. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff agreed, ruling that Custom Cleaners did not violate the city's Consumer Protection Act.	1
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared Monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout Libya are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it, according to excerpts from the interview, which a U.S. official described as "delusional." "No demonstration at all in the streets," he told ABC News and the BBC in a joint interview carried out at a restaurant in Tripoli, excerpts of which were posted on the BBC's website. Told by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning, Gadhafi asked, "Are they supporting us?" Gadhafi, wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing, refused to accept the reporter's assertion that they were not. "No. No one against us. Against me for what?" He repeated his assertion that he is not president, but one of the people. "They love me, all my people with me, they love me all. They will die to protect me, my people. No, no." Asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation's second-largest city, Benghazi, Gadhafi said it was al Qaeda, not the Libyan people, who had done so. "Al Qaeda," he said. "They came from outside." ABC's Christiane Amanpour, in a posting on the network's website, said Gadhafi arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security. "Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out, and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story," Amanpour wrote. He questioned how the international community could freeze his assets, impose sanctions and embargo arms sales based on media reports, and invited the United Nations to carry out an independent "fact-finding mission," she reported. He vowed not to leave Libya, she reported, and denied having used force against his people. "He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him, and that other big cities in Libya, particularly those in the east, had been taken by his opponents," she said. "He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him. He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation."	1
For decades, comic books have had major shake-ups in their pages, with varying degrees of fan support -- and outrage. In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released "Amazing Spider-Man" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of "The Superior Spider-Man" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: "Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it." Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic.

Rafael Nadal's status as the world's top tennis player may have dimmed slightly with two recent final defeats, but the Spaniard showed again on Sunday that he is the man to beat on clay. The 24-year-old extended his record of most successive titles in an ATP Tour event with his seventh success in Monte Carlo, boosting his leading tally of Masters Series crowns to 19. Nadal beat fourth-seeded compatriot David Ferrer 6-4 7-5 in the final as he shook off successive losses on hard-court surfaces to the pretender to his throne, Novak Djokovic, to claim his 44th career title and the $630,000 first prize. He has won 30 of those on clay, putting him equal third in the post-1968 Open Era list alongside compatriot Manuel Orantes and Bjorn Borg. "Rafa is incredible on clay. I mean, he's everywhere at the same time. He's the best player on clay in history," Ferrer told the tournament's official web site. Djokovic, unbeaten in 2011, missed this tournament due to a knee injury but the Serbian is expected to line up alongside Nadal at the Madrid Masters at the start of next month. Nadal won that event last year as he went through the clay season unbeaten, culminating in his fifth French Open triumph. That run saw him beat Ferrer in the final of the Rome Masters, and he again denied the 29-year-old a 1,000-point haul in Monte Carlo on Sunday as he avenged his defeat at the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. Ferrer dropped serve as early as the third game, but the world No. 6 broke back immediately as both players made uncharacteristic errors that would be symptomatic of a match also featuring moments of brilliance. Nadal broke again in the fifth game and won the opening set in 70 minutes. He won against serve in the third game of the second set before Ferrer fought back to lead 5-4, but Nadal broke him again to go 6-5 up and sealed victory when his opponent netted on the second match-point. Nadal's only defeat in Monte Carlo came at his first appearance in 2003. Is Sharapova back as a real contender? Meanwhile, Russia ended Italy's Fed Cup reign by reaching the final of the women's teams event with a comprehensive 5-0 victory on Sunday.	1

Even if you know nothing about IndyCar Racing or NASCAR, the odds are you know the name Danica Patrick. The trailblazing racecar driver has been exposed to a global audience through Super Bowl commercials, modeling shoots and other mainstream partnerships. She's helped IndyCar and NASCAR spread their audiences beyond core racing fans. That brand awareness hasn't been lost in the video game space. A few years ago Patrick worked with Activision to promote its racing game, "Blur." And she is one of the featured drivers in both of Activision's licensed NASCAR console games. Now she's partnered with Sega for its new arcade racing game, "Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed." Gamers can race Patrick's converting vehicle -- it flies, drives and floats -- against popular Sega characters like Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails and Dr. Robotnick. Gamers can even put her up against Disney's Wreck-It Ralph for a virtual race. Patrick, who was recently named Nationwide's most popular driver by NASCAR fans, took some time to play the new Sega game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for CNN. How big of a gamer were growing up and what did you play? I played a lot of games growing up, as any kid naturally would do. I played "Sonic." I played "Super Mario Bros." I played any kind of racing game that existed, I played "Track and Field." I shot some ducks with "Duck Hunt." Do you have a favorite Sonic the Hedgehog memory from back then that you can share with us? Can anyone really remember that far back? I think more than anything what I remember is playing the games when I would be on the road racing go karts, and being in my van when I went to the track with my family and playing with my friends at the track. I remember the places more than I remember exact memories about the games. What's it like being featured in "Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed?" It's really neat to be a player in it, especially being such a famous game, such an iconic game. Being able to be able to be a player along with Sonic the Hedgehog and all the other All-Stars is very flattering and it's very cool. It comes full circle. How does this compare to seeing yourself in NASCAR games?	1
The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board will download ÂcertainÂ audio and video from the airlinerâs flight data and voice recorders and will begin its analysis, and the Federal Aviation Administration will determine whether any civil or criminal charges are warranted, according to the company and the NTSB. The plane was carrying more than 1,000 passengers, more than 400 of whom are children, and at least three of whom are still hospitalized as of Thursday."We do not have any idea at this time what the cause of the crash was, but we do know that our investigation is continuing and we will share information on the progress of our investigation with the families of the victims and our entire community as soon as we have it," said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman.The plane was heading to Philadelphia International Airport from Fort Lauderdale and had taken off just before 9 a.m. local time. More than 50 passengers and crew died Monday when the aircraft crashed in a field in Brandywine Hundred. Three people were initially reported missing after the crash but later confirmed dead. In addition to the three fatalities, 17 others on board were injured."The NTSB team is working nonstop from the moment we land in Fort Lauderdale until the moment we reach our destination in Philadelphia," said JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes in a statement Thursday night. "We greatly appreciate the support of the public during this difficult time, and we will continue to cooperate with all authorities as they complete their investigation."Investigators combed the crash site Thursday morning. About 150 NTSB and FAA personnel were working on the scene, said NTSB spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein, adding that the site was a disaster recovery site, not a crash site.She said the three FAA officials on board who were injured remained hospitalized. Farbstein said the NTSB team of investigators has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration officials, including investigators. "There is no way to know at this time what caused the crash of the jet," she said. "We have a lot of work ahead of us."The jetliner did not have a seat-belt extender.In a statement to reporters Wednesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration said a safety review board of experts had completed	0
The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday to extend three provisions of the Patriot Act and Intelligence Reform bill that are due to expire next month. The bill, which extends the provisions for another three months, passed in a 279-143 vote.  Republicans overwhelmingly backed the extensions, while a majority of Democrats were opposed. The measure now goes to President Barack Obama's desk to be signed into law. A similar measure extending the provisions for a longer period of time failed last week by a vote of 277-148 -- seven votes shy of the 284 needed to pass under a House rule requiring a two-thirds majority. Thursday's House vote required only a simple majority.  The Senate approved the final version of the measure earlier this week. One of the three provisions, Section 206 of the Patriot Act, provides for roving wiretap surveillance of targets who try to thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance. Without such roving wiretap authority, investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location, phone or computer that needs to be monitored. Another provision, Section 215, allows the FBI to apply to the FISA court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases. The third provision, Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004, closes a loophole that could allow individual terrorists not affiliated with specific organizations to slip through the cracks of FISA surveillance. Law enforcement officials refer to it as the "lone wolf" provision. Legislators opposed to the extensions claim the provisions -- particularly related to wiretapping --  are intrusive and unconstitutional.  Supporters argue they are a critical component of U.S. anti-terror operations. The White House has indicated it would have preferred a longer extension of the three provisions, through 2013.	1
The Syrian government has warned protesters in the city of Homs to stop demonstrations, hand in weapons and surrender defecting military members by Monday night or face bombardment, an opposition leader said. A 72-hour warning was given Saturday, said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army. Activists on the ground said the ultimatum was issued on Friday. The Syrian National Council, the country's leading opposition movement, had warned earlier of a potential bloodbath at the hands of the Syrian regime in Homs. "If the world continues to watch, then the massacre of Hama in the '80s will be repeated," said Hamdo, referring to 1982, when Syria's military -- acting under orders from current President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- launched an assault on the city, killing thousands. Opposition: Anti-regime doctor killed The military has dug trenches around Homs, Hamdo said. "There is no electricity, water, or communication whatsoever now and the communication breakdown has extended even closer to the Turkish border," he said. The Syrian government denied reports of water and electricity being out in the city, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). The government made no mention of the reported deadline on the news agency's website Sunday morning. Opposition figures launched a nationwide anti-government strike Sunday, which they called the "strike of dignity." The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gets information from people in different parts of the country, said people in Homs and neighboring towns widely joined the strike. "All shops were closed on all main roads in the city," the group said. Several videos posted on Youtube purported to show government loyalists breaking locks of shops that closed in support of Sunday's anti-government strike. But on SANA, the Syrian government quoted people across the country as saying there was no strike and no sign of a strike.  "It was a normal trading day in markets throughout the Syrian provinces as people bought and sold consumer goods, vegetables, fruit and clothes as economic elements shrugged off all inflammatory tendentious calls by terrorist groups that are associated with foreigners," the government insisted. Protesters attack employees at Syrian Embassy in Jordan As violence raged Sunday in parts of the country, the death toll reached 23, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC). Five of the dead were children, the group said.	1
Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. "I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. "I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  "The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games."  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. "Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria," Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. "They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."	1
In matters regarding Nigeria, the international community seems to be learning from experience. Why galvanize support for a government that then exercises its sovereignty by not backing up that support? Why effuse sympathy on people who themselves seem to care so little? When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria. From Michelle Obama to Alicia Keys to Malala Yousafzai, personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign. This response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by Amnesty International as Boko Haram's deadliest attack -- the massacre of up to 2,000 mostly women and children in Baga town of northeast Nigeria last week. At about the same time that the Baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world, the international community was rallying around France in support against the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris, giving rise to the #JeSuisCharlie social media campaign. A simultaneous #IAmBaga social media campaign has failed to gain much steam. The Igbo proverb points out that a man cannot expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep. Similarly, a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support. France's President Francois Hollande was addressing the world's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack. His government's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see. Nigeria's President Jonathan, on the other hand, waited two weeks before even offering a word on the Chibok kidnappings. So far, he has said nothing about Baga. However, President Jonathan has issued a statement condemning the Paris attacks. Perhaps it is not that the Nigerian government does not care about its own people. Perhaps they simply want to spare us the repetitiveness of their public statements and condemnations: "The perpetrators of this dastardly act shall be brought to book". "No stone shall be left unturned". "God will punish them and their families". But who cares about words and worn-out clichés? Action is what the Nigerian people need.	1
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday insisted that his country's nuclear arsenal is "definitely safe," despite growing concerns about recent gains by the Taliban along the country's border with Afghanistan. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari insists his country's nuclear arsenal is "definitely safe" from militants. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Zardari responded to the fact that the United States doesn't know the locations of all of Pakistan's nuclear sites. He also addressed the Obama administrations concern over whether the weapons are vulnerable to Taliban fighters who are gaining control of some border regions. "They can't take over," Zardari said, referring to militants. "We have a 700,000 (person) army -- how could they take over?" For the last two weeks, Pakistani troops have been battling Taliban fighters in Buner and Lower Dir, two districts bordering the Swat Valley -- a broad Taliban stronghold in Pakistan. Army generals claim to have killed scores of militants. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley, in exchange for an end to fighting. Still, Pakistan's military is continuing an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of the agreement signed by Zardari. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama said Pakistan's government appears to be "very fragile" and argued that the United States has "huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable" and doesn't end up a "nuclear-armed militant state." And, after making two visits to Pakistan in the last three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated Monday that he is "gravely concerned" about recent Taliban and al Qaeda gains across much of southern Afghanistan and in Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear weapons are "definitely safe," Zardari said Tuesday. "First of all, they are in safe hands. There is a command and control system under the president of Pakistan. And Buner ... there has been fighting there before. There will be fighting there again and there will always be an issue of people in those mountains that we've been taking on."	1
The six-point peace plan for Syria proposed by Kofi Annan is doomed to fail for one simple reason: Neither President Bashar al-Assad nor the government opposition is interested in making it work. For al-Assad, full integration into the state is as far as he will go. To his supporters, a military solution is not an option because it would kill the Islamic opposition. For the opposition, the only possible solution is a political one: to form a unified front around the UN-established Geneva peace process and to insist on the removal of Assad from power. There is, however, one problem: That the main parties – the Syrian government and the opposition – have completely failed to get along even before the war started. The war has been the catalyst for the disintegration of Syria. It has further strengthened the Assad regime and led to a crisis that could not have been solved by any other means. Instead, the only viable solution is to remove Bashar al-Assad from power through a negotiated peace agreement. And not because Annan and his foreign backers imagine that he will succeed in forging peace.For its part, the Syrian government has done nothing to improve the situation. Instead, it has continued to increase its repression, while making no efforts to meet the demands on it made by the opposition. While a regime change would bring relief to its citizens, the Syrian government finds the current situation unacceptable, and has embarked on a course that will only lead to further chaos in Syria. To make matters worse, the U.S. government is using its special powers to impose its will on the regime. The conflict is not a fight between two opposing armies, as the Syrian leadership seems to believe, but one between the U.S., which supports the Assad regime militarily, and a coalition of states, which are concerned with maintaining stability in the region and fighting against extremist organizations.The real reason why Annan’s plan is doomed to fail has nothing to do with the political dynamics in Syria or any other country. It is because Annan is not serious about finding peace. He is only after a political solution, but one that does not lead to victory in the war. A negotiated peace by Annan means surrender of the government and the withdrawal of the Syrian army from the country (an outcome of no interest to the West). It means acceptance of the government of Damascus after years of conflict and the end of the U.S. and Israel�	0
The United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. Federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday. The United States already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials. "If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law," the administration official said. The complaint charges Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal Espionage Act. Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month. The Guardian revealed Snowden's identify at his request. The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. The revelation rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties. Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach. They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself. In interviews earlier this month, Snowden said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamiliton. The company has since fired him. A series of blog posts this week purportedly by Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened "abusive" practices, instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate.	1
A jury in Copenhagen City Court on Monday found 25-year-old Chechen Lors Doukaev guilty of attempted terrorism, the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhighest levelÃ¢â‚¬ of his three-year trial.Doukaev, who faces a separate trial in March, told investigators he was born in Kosovo and said he is a member of the radical Islamic Salafi group Ã¢â‚¬ËœIslam4UKÃ¢â‚¬.He said he has "no regrets at all" about joining the group, which "promote[s] a political Islamic ideology and a violent political program to achieve its goals."His lawyer told his trial that he was radicalised by reading books about the prophet Muhammad.In its ruling, the court said Doukaev had been influenced by the "tendencies of the Salafi movement," and said he "believed that jihad was compatible with the idea of one God."The court called it a "truly terrible moment in our history and the history of many other societies."The verdict is not a precedent and there is no automatic right to a retrial for an individual charged with terrorism. The court said that Doukaev's conviction would serve as "a deterrent for others in the future."Doukaev - who was wearing a blue jail uniform with the head wound of a dog on one of the lapels - had been placed on a 14-day suspended sentence.Police on Monday released a picture of the dog's head wound before his arrest.The court found that Doukaev, who left England with his parents in 2005, was "a person of good character who had the potential to contribute to the health of Danish society."The court did not order a retrial of the Salafi preacher, whose conviction was the first in Denmark for terrorism.In August 2013, the court had found him guilty of belonging to "an organisation of terrorist organisations and inciting racial hatred in the Danish public."Earlier, prosecutor Henrik Stahre told the court that Doukaev met in 2009 with the parents of two 12-year-old girls. They were later arrested for illegal immigration and deported.During the trial, Doukaev had testified about his life in Britain and Denmark as a	0
President Barack Obama gave Pope Francis a box of seeds as a gift, a fitting token as their first-ever meeting provided a fresh start of sorts between the administration and Catholic leadership after years of strained relations. "These, I think, are carrots," Obama told the Pontiff, showing him a pouch from the box, which was made from timber from the first cathedral to open in the United States, in Baltimore. The Pope gave the President two medallions -- one symbolizing the need for peace and solidarity between the two hemispheres -- and a copy of "Evangelii Gaudium," or "The Joy of the Gospel."  The book was penned by the Pope and calls for a new era of evangelization and a renewed focus on the poor. The tokens of goodwill underscored the goal of the meeting: Focus on areas where two of the world's most influential men agree, and gently tread ground where they differ. The two men greeted each other with a smile and a handshake and posed for pictures before sitting down across a table from each other. They spoke privately for nearly an hour. When they emerged from the meeting, the President and the Vatican had slightly different takes on the tenor of their discussions, especially when it came to issues that have frayed the relationship between the Obama administration and American Catholic leaders. "... (I)t was hoped that, in areas of conflict, there would be respect for humanitarian and international law and a negotiated solution between the parties involved," the Vatican said in a statement. "In the context of bilateral relations and cooperation between Church and State, there was a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the Church in that country, such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection. ..." Obama, in a news conference that followed, told reporters that such issues were "not a topic of conversation" with the Pope and instead were discussed with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. According to the Vatican, the two men also discussed the issue of immigration reform and "stated their common commitment to the eradication of human trafficking throughout the world." On this point, the President and the Pope were simpatico.	1
The 15-year-old Mexican youth who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told  Reuters.“We don’t have any information that he was smuggling illegals,” Qualia said. “It was an isolated incident and that was never even part of his plan.”The agent was placed on administrative leave and the incident is being investigated.BORDER PATROL SUSPECTED MURDERED BY ARMED OFFICERS“It was an action that we’ll thoroughly investigate,” he added.The shooting occurred about 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, after agents and their dogs detained a migrant man, who claimed he was carrying $40,000 in drugs, at the border, said a federal official familiar with the case.The migrant said the drugs were hidden in a woman’s vagina, according to the official.After the man was taken away by the agents, another man ran up to the agents and shot one of them, the official said. The agent returned fire, killing the man.Border Patrol and Customs officials said the two men had been found to be in possession of a large quantity of marijuana.The incident is under investigation by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility, the official said.The slain agent was identified by the official by the name of “Esa”, which had been given to the agent by another agency that the official declined to identify.The name matches that of the agent assigned to the border at the time of the shooting, the official said, declining to elaborate.The agent who was shot was reportedly injured and taken to a local hospital, where he was recovering but was listed as being unconscious and in a semi-critical condition, the official said.The border had experienced a surge of migrant crossings during the holidays, when hundreds of people sought passage to the United States for work and relatives, and the surge has reached its peak for this year on Christmas Day, according to CBP data.The agent who was shot was assigned to the San Diego sector from June 2014 to November 2015, according to his official personnel file.According to	0
A suspected leader of the Juarez drug cartel told authorities he had ordered the deaths of about 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said Sunday. Federal police detailed accusations against Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, known Â­as "El Mencho" or "The Chucho," in a press conference, saying he ordered the killings of at least 1,500 people in Mexico's most violent city.Mexican authorities identified at least 10 people killed by gunmen involved in a shootout Sunday in the town of Ciudad Juarez, where a carjacking suspect has offered a $20,0000 reward for information leading to his capture. More than a dozen policemen were killed in the incident, which involved more than 30 armed people and at least 16 vehicles, according to the Federal Police.A member of Mexico's new national guard was shot and killed Sunday as he was patrolling a highway along the border with the United States, officials said. The man was traveling between Ciudad Juarez and a border crossing in Matamoros, near Brownsville, Texas, when officers flagged down his car, which they suspect may have been used for drug smuggling, authorities said.Officials have arrested seven men with ties to drug traffickers operating in Mexico who were in the United States illegally and have charged them with conspiring to smuggle more than 1.5 tons of cocaine through Nuevo Laredo, the Mexican border city that is central in the ongoing drug trade. Federal prosecutor Enrique Garcia Soto told reporters that the men had tried to board a truck in Texas and try to send it to Mexico.A drug lord has been sent to prison for life in Mexico after a judge ordered him to be kept under house arrest during the trial of six other men, prosecutors said on Monday. The head of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico's Pacific coast state of Sinaloa was sentenced by a court to 10 years in prison and a fine of $2.8 million for drug trafficking and murder, the attorney general said, citing a judicial official.Mexican authorities have arrested a former top soldier in the army's elite forces in connection with the killing of a former army general during an ambush in Mexico. The army has begun a manhunt for a 20-year-old soldier who allegedly shot dead Miguel Angel Trevino Solis, the former general of the Mexican army. The general was said to be in his 80s.	0
Smoking is bad for you, and by now, most of us know it. An estimated 4.5 million U.S. adolescents are cigarette smokers. It seems that studies on the dangers of smoking come out every week. Just recently, after an article appeared in the journal Pediatrics, we were introduced to the concept of third-hand smoke, the potentially toxic residue that lingers in curtains, clothing, hair, etc. after the smoke itself blows away. To recap: Smoking exponentially increases your risk of developing lung cancer (and other lung diseases, like emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and puts you at higher risk for cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix and stomach. Smoking also elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and insulin resistance. And, as if all that weren't bad enough, it causes wrinkles. Yet stand on virtually any streetcorner of any city or town in the United States, and you will see people smoking. So, who exactly -- in the face of all the mounting scientific evidence, social stigma and legal bans -- still lights up? According to the CDC, about 43.4 million Americans (19.8 percent of the population) smoke. Look around you. If you are in Kentucky, the state with the highest smoking rate, more than one out of every four people (28.3 percent) around you smokes. On the other end of the spectrum is Utah, with just over one person in 10 (11.7 percent) a smoker.  Find the smoking rate in your state » Here's the good news: "Smoking prevalence in the entire country has gone under 20 percent for first time in over 50 years," said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic. "For women, it's 18 percent in most places, and for men it's hovering at about 20 percent. We have gone from one in two men smoking to one in five -- a very dramatic change -- and one in three women to one in five." Here's the bad news: Smoking rates are unlikely to drop to the national health objective of 12 percent by 2010.	1
Fakher Zayed is accustomed to trouble erupting on his doorstep. For the past several years, Palestinian protesters have often clashed with Israeli security forces in front of his house. The four-story building ́s doors opened onto a narrow courtyard, a short stroll from the nearby University of Haifa, which has long hosted meetings of the World Zionist Organization and the Israel National Council.“You really have to be careful who you invite here,” Zayed told The Times on a recent afternoon. “When I come here, I don’t want my problems to touch anyone.”He’s been fighting long and hard to shut down the protest encampments springing up outside the entrances of his home. This is not an exercise in nonviolent discipline, he insists. He’s tried to block every protester who enters.Zayed is an Arab Israeli, born to a Christian family in Haifa. “I am not a militant,” he said. “I just want to stay on my side of the wire.”A few months ago, he went to a conference on human rights in the Middle East. At the close of it, a young man approached him, with a camera and microphone. “I was wondering if you could help,” he said, offering to help film the protest. Zayed invited him to remain on his side of the wire. The man set up his gear and began filming. Soon he was being shot at with rubber-coated steel slugs. The man was wounded.The Palestinian man did not know who the attacker was. The young Muslim man who came to Zayed with his camera was a Muslim convert, named Muhammad al-Halabi. He had asked Zayed if he’d be interested in filming a protest. The man said his name, Muhammad, was his actual name. He said he had been living in the West Bank for 20 years. Zayed and his wife had married in the West Bank as Muslim converts. They are now living in Haifa.Zayed has known al-Halabi for years. “I know I am getting trouble,” he said.On New Year’s Eve 2012, Mohammed al-Halabi was arrested after a pair of police officers pulled him over for allegedly running red lights. The police searched his car and found	0
An Alaska judge has denied Bristol Palin's request that her court fight with ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston over custody of their son be kept private to avoid a "media circus." The daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is seeking full custody of 1-year-old Tripp, contending that Johnston is too immature to be a responsible father and that his mother's felony drug conviction makes her a danger to the child. Bristol Palin filed for full custody in November, but Johnston is seeking shared custody. Both parents are 19. Their teenage relationship fell under an intense public spotlight after Sen. John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate in August 2008. Court documents, now unsealed, were published online Monday by the Anchorage Daily News. Johnston joined the family at the Republican National Convention after the campaign confirmed that Bristol, then 17, was five months pregnant with his child. The couple broke off their engagement about two months after their son's birth in December 2008. Johnston has asked that the case conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin, whom he said was "powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive." But Bristol Palin's request that the case be sealed said public proceedings "will turn this custody case into a media circus which is not in Tripp's best interest." "In this day and age of the Internet, media stories remain available for years, even decades, after they are first published, and anything printed in the media (whether it is true or not) will be available to Tripp when he is old enough to read," Palin said in a sworn affidavit. She said Johnston wanted a public case so he could "continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion." Johnston was set to take part in a reality show in Alaska, she said. "I do not believe that it would be in Tripp's best interest for Levi's reality show to be filming this case as it unfolds, or for Levi Johnston to be capitalizing off of this custody case through his reality show," Palin said. Johnston's sworn statement said he feared what Sarah Palin might do against him if the case were kept secret. "I really think that closing the court could make this matter very uncivil and potentially open the door for poor influences on Bristol and her attorney that may be extremely inappropriate and potentially harmful to Tripp," he said.	1
After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, "Fashion Police" is going on an extended break. The fashion commentary show on E! channel announced Tuesday that it will be on hiatus until September. "We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season," it said in a statement. The announcement caps a rocky few months. Last week, co-host Kathy Griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes, saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts. She made a dig at the show on her way out. "There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people's bodies into it," she said in a statement. "I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference." Shortly before her departure, co-host Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana. Rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen's defense. But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later. Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski  will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers.	1
She stood there, injured and holding a knife, outside her Florida home. That image is horrifying enough, but nothing compared to what police say they found inside. All three of that woman's children were unresponsive when officers  arrived to check on them about a month and a half ago."She was standing in her backyard. She was holding her 2-year-old and holding her 5-year-old," said Lt. Mike Williams of the Orlando police. "She was holding the knife in her right hand, she was holding her son in her left hand, and they were laying on the ground."The three children were taken to a hospital for several months. Now, their mother, 28-year-old Brittany Leigh Cagle, is charged with three counts of child abuse and is accused of killing the three children and injuring herself."We believe the children were in the yard and she was holding them under her dress with the knife, we know she was holding them and there were cuts to her. At that point we believe, even though she was on the ground, she was trying to stab her children," Williams said to ABC News.Her next court appearance is now scheduled for September 14.A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said the woman was often seen walking the neighborhood in the middle of the night carrying a baby."I would see her walk by in her high heels, I would wonder if she was okay. I felt like it was bothering me, like somebody was hurting her, I don't know," the neighbor said.She could not see her children but said they appeared to be fine.The mother of Cagle's two daughters, age 10 and 14, went into the home to take care of the older child and her 3-year-old brother, but police say she injured the youngest, who was in the second bedroom, before the children were brought to hospital.She told detectives she had fallen, that she did not know how, but that she was trying to save the children.She also told police that she cut herself on a piece of metal about 2 inches long that was part of a metal railing. Authorities told her to have a doctor look at it. After the child was taken to the hospital, Cagle told police she had cut her hand on the metal and that her family had never seen any cuts on her.	0
Things are looking up for entrepreneurs in the Middle East as a new breed of crowdfunding is emerging to help bring life to innovative ideas from the region. Based on popular U.S. sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo they aim to connect everyone, from engineers in Egypt to creatives in Lebanon, with a new way of funding. Zoomaal is one such site that allows someone to post a "project" like an album, a book or an invention, which the public can then pledge money to. Each project must fit into one of the platform's categories and be accompanied by a video, a biography of the project owner and a series of "gifts" to incentivize potential backers to pledge money. In line with regional sensitivities, banned projects include anything to do with alcohol, politics, violence, religion and pornography. Abdallah Absi, 21, is the platform's founder who has been involved with tech start-ups since he was 16. "There are many projects in the Arab world that don't have the right connections (to) fund them," said Absi. "We are trying to market these projects through strategic partnerships." Currently entrepreneurs from 22 countries across the Middle East and North Africa can post a project on the site. Projects include an album launch, a documentary and a new take on the toothbrush. Globally, crowdfunding is seeing explosive growth. In 2012, the market grew 81% to $2.7 billion, according industry researchers Massolution. But in the Middle East the concept is only just catching on. A lack of financial support and, crucially, mentorship is something that Absi believes is holding back creative projects and nascent start-ups in the region. For Habib Haddad, CEO of Wamda, and one of four venture capital funders behind Zoomaal, the true potential of Arab crowdfunding is the connections and exposure it provides. "There is definitely a funding gap, but that's not the biggest gap. Access to early-stage money is actually now increasing in the Middle East. "This kind of platform for the Middle East is something that will push the ecosystem of innovators forward," he added. "It will help democratise creativity." Absi believes the key to making this happen is education and outreach because some "creative communities are not very tech savvy ... and they don't know about the opportunity they can have from crowdfunding."	1
Washington and Lee University cited slavery's "regrettable" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place. The decision was announced in a message Tuesday from university President Kenneth Ruscio following discussions of concerns raised by black students about the campus environment. In 1826 the University -- then Washington College -- owned between 70 to 80 slaves and benefited from their labor, wrote Ruscio. "Acknowledging that historical record -- and acknowledging the contributions of those individuals -- will require coming to terms with a part of our past that we wish had been different but that we cannot ignore," Ruscio said. Ruscio also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from Lee Chapel. The flags are replicas of original and historic battle flags that were once at the site. The university in Lexington is named for President George Washington and Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who later served as school president until his death in 1870. He is buried in a crypt beneath the landmark chapel. The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio. A group of black law students, referred to as "The Committee," has been communicating with the administration about its concerns, leader Brandon Hicks said Wednesday. Their letter began a dialogue between the students and the administration. "It's about creating a climate on campus that everyone feels welcome," Hicks told CNN on why he sought the changes. He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel. "These are huge steps. We are ecstatic," Hicks said of Ruscio's announcement. Black students comprise 2% of the undergraduate student body at Washington and Lee. "It's commendable that the university and the administration took into consideration the feelings of all students," Hernandez Stroud, former president of the Black Law Students Association, told CNN. "I think these are age-old issues that are as challenging as they are controversial and I think there are people all across the spectrum that understand no solution will please everyone. But I do think what was incredibly encouraging was the care the administration used with these issues," Stroud said. "Schools are more than just their history," Stroud said. In April, Ruscio said questions raised by law students were legitimate.	1
A young, beloved teacher found killed in the woods. A 14-year-old student in custody, charged with her murder. That much we know. But hours after both were found -- one dead, one alive -- in suburbs northeast of Boston, much ichthyological speculation has turned to whether the two were lovers, or even, at least, were connected.But the real mystery may be one of timing. It's possible that the killing was a tragic accident, perhaps by a family member or even a friend, and that the killing of both young women may have been more of a coincidence.As the bodies were discovered, police questioned the possibility of any connection between the two teens . But the fact that they were lying, face to face, in the same spot in the woods, suggested there were not much other connection in evidence between them."You'd expect a young boy to be with a young woman, with a teenager to be with a teenager."The timing has been difficult to fathom too. Boston police, who are looking into the deaths as both murders, called it "unusual" when officers were dispatched to the scene."We don't know that this is a series of one accidental events," Boston Police Commissioner Thomas Cameron said at a press conference. "We're obviously looking very hard at what happened, and we're asking the public to help us piece pieces of this together."Investigators said a search for an unattended car that would have been discovered on the side of the road, as the victims were killed, had been unsuccessful.So if the boys' bodies were found in the area where they last saw each other -- around two miles from the place where the teens' bodies were discovered -- there would be a fair amount of speculation about whether or not they were involved in a relationship that had been broken."You'd expect a young boy to be with a young woman, with a teenager to be with a teenager," Officer Chris O'Donnell was quoted as saying by the Associated Press . "We don't know that this is a series of one accidental events."But there are all kinds of reasons why two teens could be so close and then not spend as much time together when they meet.What is common is that both teens were found within days of each other, and both had been missing for several days before either their bodies were found dead,"	0
Opie & Anthony" has been cut in half. Anthony Cumia, the "Anthony" portion of the shock-jock radio team, was fired by employer Sirius XM after Cumia made a series of racially charged tweets Wednesday night. "SiriusXM has terminated its relationship with Anthony Cumia of the 'Opie & Anthony' channel," Patrick Reilly, the satellite radio broadcaster's media relations manager, said in a statement. "The decision was made, and Cumia informed, late Thursday, July 3, after careful consideration of his racially-charged and hate-filled remarks on social media. Those remarks and postings are abhorrent to SiriusXM, and his behavior is wholly inconsistent with what SiriusXM represents." According to Cumia, on Wednesday night he was taking pictures in Times Square when an African-American woman objected to being photographed. Cumia claims he was assaulted by the woman. He let loose with a series of tweets, many with profane and inflammatory language. One called the woman an "animal pig face worthless meat sack" and worse. He did not report the alleged assault to the police. When asked why by one person on Twitter, he responded, "Because I can take some punches w/out wasting the cops time." Cumia appeared to be caught by surprise by the firing. "Sirius decided to cave and fire me. Welcome to bizarro world. Fired for s**t that wasn't even on the air & wasn't illegal. So, who's next?" he tweeted Friday morning. It's not the first time the duo has been in trouble.

If you haven't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to Meerkat, chances are you will soon. The livestreaming ________ is on Facebook and its newest feature: live comments.A Meerkat friend asked me to "Meerkat it" in a comment on his Facebook post. I agreed, but after posting he asked me to add him to the group. I hesitated for a while, then told him that if we wanted to be Meerkat friends all we had to do was message each other.When you and your friends decide to "Meerkat" (and you've been asked before), the first thing that's required of you is that you take the group to a different topic. You can choose from many, but the most common are: "Diary," "Meaning," "What you want to do," "What you think about," "What you should do," "What your friends think you should do," "What your friends think you should not do," "What it means to be happy," "What it means to be smart," "What it means to be stupid," "What your best friend thinks you should do," "What your best friend thinks you should not do," "Whatever your best friend wants to do," "What you and your best friend want to do," "What you and your best friend think about," "What you and your best friend should do," "What your best friend thinks you should do," and "What your best friend should not do" (and a "What your best friend wants to do") — there are over 30 different topics. Each one is a new area of interest for all of you, a new topic to meerkat. For this to happen, one or both of you have to agree to meerkat, "Meerkat it," "Meerkat the whole world," or some other topic.Because the group itself is online, your "Meerkat it" comment is also available to all of Meerkat's members, and you're able to read it before you post it.To keep Meerkat from being boring, there are certain times when your comment is not meant for public consumption. These times include when you're not following a group of my friends on Facebook. I post my "Meerkat it" comment in the "Meerkat it" comment field, because otherwise I'd be on	0
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN. O'Malley amplified 2016 speculation when he told the Washington Post last week that he can't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision. He told CNN on Monday that he was working toward offering "a better direction for our country." Sounds like he's planning to go for it, right? Not quite. O'Malley is angling to be the person who could step in should Clinton decide to forgo a second White House candidacy. She's the odd-on favorite in early polls to capture the Democratic nomination should she throw her hat in the ring. "The big question isn't what happens if she runs, it's what happens if she doesn't," the source said. "In that sense, he is trying to lay the groundwork so that Democrats aren't left without any potential candidates." Though, there's always Vice President Joe Biden, whose considering a bid, and a number of other Democrats in and out of Washington who would probably take a shot. But outside of Biden, who can probably wait a little longer than most due to his name recognition and certain advantages associated with his office, no one else outside of O'Malley is setting themselves up as he is for becoming Clinton's understudy. And that may be with good reason, as an O'Malley vs. Clinton race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor. A CNN/ORC International poll this week showed 70% of Democrats support her nomination. Note, Clinton was the heavy favorite in 2008 only to be overtaken by Barack Obama. But no one in the potential Democratic field is seen at this early moment as electrifying and transformational as Obama was that year. Instead of stoking speculation, the source said O'Malley is being a good party man. He's helping President Barack Obama's initiatives, helping to build infrastructure for 2014 and supporting candidates as he travels the country. Clinton lurks in corner of Republican meeting Looking more closely, here how it breaks down for O'Malley and what's likely influencing his thinking around Hillary Clinton and a presidential run.	1
The Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words. Faced with this challenge, "It's easier to learn English!" he joked, his wit shining through, even though  his words were meant to be addressed to a Chinese who had once asked him, before I met him, what the Chinese word for "painting" was. (In the end, it's a little-known French word, an adaptation of the Arabic "tajmal.")The paintings in this book are not all landscapes, however. They are paintings of people, often of parents and children. With a focus on the human figure and the human body, they're an intimate and tender tribute to a family's hopes, fears and sorrows. They are about feeling and understanding. They are about love."You don't need to love someone to paint his life as it was passed down to you," Zao Wou-ki told me one afternoon."You just need to love yourself for whatever it is that you're trying to show people," he added, smiling, "and to understand that that will always be there just because you're a human being."This book was written before the Chinese artist's passing in 2012, and when I revisited the idea of making art for the people in our lives, I found that the art could actually be very personal.A new edition of this book is now available from Bloomsbury.This book is supported by the Canada Council and the Province of British Columbia through the New Canadian Library Program.# [_The Painters Series: A Chinese Painting  of All Times_](9780062263472_epub_toc_r1.htm#c04)_For your protection, whenever you download a copy of a title from this site, you should protect yourself by buying a protection plan for 600 yen ($6.50), which you can download here._## [ **The Painter** _by_ **YAN FU**](9780062263472_epub_toc_r1.htm#c05)This painting is a portrait of a man.

In its short, sweet first season, Shonda Rhimes' Scandal introduced powerhouse political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her powerful associates, including President Fitzgerald "Fitz" Grant himself (Tony Goldwyn). Before "Scandal's" Blu-ray/DVD hits stores tomorrow, Washington shared with EW her favorite moments from the D.C. drama, discussed her electrifying chemistry with Goldwyn, and even dished on season 2. Though Washington claimed to love the "dirty work of acting," she clearly prefers watching co-star Guillermo Diaz "torture" another actor rather than the steamy scene she shared with Goldwyn. "That stuff is not fun, at all," she said. "Those are private moments. But that's what acting is -- it's about... having the courage to allow your audience into the private moments of your characters' lives. Those are difficult." Another kind of torture? Not letting herself be paralyzed by the knowledge the man with whom she's steaming up the small screen is happily married. It's just an occupational hazard, though: "Anybody who cares about somebody who has to do scenes like that [has to be] really compassionate." She adds, "Tony's very in love with his wife and his daughters, who I've met. It's all good!" Never fear, Fitz fans! Washington assured, "I know Tony's still going to be around" when the show resumes filming in July. But that doesn't mean all Olivia's relationships are secure. How will Olivia react when she learns what peppy underling Quinn has been hiding? "A lot of that depends on who she is," said Washington. "I don't think Olivia makes decisions on how to treat people or how to navigate a situation blindly. She really takes into account the circumstance at hand." "Scandal" season 1 comes out on Blu-ray/DVD tomorrow. See full story and exclusive video at EW.com.

Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity. Alfredo Cristiani in 1994 shortly  after the country's civil war declared him president.The group's complaint says that Cristiani, who had led El Salvador through its war and peace with a strong nationalist, anti-apartheid agenda, "intentionally covered up and concealed the crimes of torture, forced disappearances, political killings, summary executions, crimes against humanity, and other war crimes against civilian populations in El Salvador, and engaged in other atrocities and atrocities against the people of El Salvador in violation of international law. The atrocities to which the plaintiffs refer are numerous and varied, but generally fall into two categories: First, the events in El Salvador from June 1985 (when Cristiani took office in June) until the fall of 1989, in which the Government of El Salvador systematically inflicted systematic torture on thousands of civilians, including human bombs, that were dropped on urban centers; and second, the incidents of summary executions that occurred between June 1985 and the fall of 1989, which are described elsewhere in this document. The events of December 1988 to August 1990 are part of the second category, and they include incidents in which summary executions of political opponents and supporters of the left and the right, including members of the Communist Party, by the military were carried out as part of the military's efforts to suppress dissent and prevent the spread of civil war. Such actions in El Salvador are in violation of international law."The Salvadoran lawsuit claims that the U.S and Spanish governments should be held liable for failing to ensure that Cristiani's crimes against humanity were investigated.The US-based Human Rights Watch organization said it is in contact with human rights advocates, journalists and lawyers in El Salvador."We are in close contact with human rights advocates, journalists and lawyers in El Salvador, who have raised grave concerns about the lack of accountability for the abuses committed by Alfredo Cristiani in his leadership, which is now coming to light, we hope, after the filing of this lawsuit," said Richard Butler, deputy director of the US-based International Justice Network. "Our hope is that when this happens it will lead to a much-needed truth and justice process in El Salvador."The Spanish NGO, the Salvadoran Rights Action (Reformando-Asociacion Pro D	0
Oh, figure skating. Not again. Didn't anyone tell you? The Cold War is over. You are supposed to be reformed. At the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, South Korea's Yuna Kim, a 2010 Olympic gold medalist, skated an ethereally beautiful and outwardly perfect long program in the ladies free skating competition. She then lost gold to Russia's Adelina Sotnikova. Few saw that coming. On paper, Sotnikova had one more triple jump than Kim, including the triple loop, which Kim does not do. Although Sotnikova had an awkward moment on her own double loop, her spins were faster, her jumps higher, and unlike Kim, who looked exhausted at the end of her gorgeous skate, Sotnikova flew across the ice with great speed and then looked like she could do it all again. It should have been a great moment in Olympic sports: champion dethroned by a rising star, an upset, a shocker. Instead, it was controversial water cooler fodder the next day because the results raised so many questions: Did the youngster, a bit rough around the edges, deserve such high marks? Was she really better in just about every element, including her components mark, which was an astonishing 4.81 points higher than at the European championships last month? Setting aside her extreme margin of victory, there are reasons to think the judges got the podium right. Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko, for example, who had always accentuated an aggressive style over artistry, praised the marks, pleased that the judges rewarded Sotnikova's athleticism and degrees of difficulty over Kim's elegance. Figure skating is, after all, a sport. But if it wants to be treated like one, it has to act like one. There is a long history of controversy and scandal that continues to hang over the International Skating Federation, particularly as Russia's first individual female gold medalist (and on home ice, no less) brings familiar echoes of the Cold War. And during the team competition, there were murmurs, to be sure, over Evgeni Plushenko's high marks. It appeared to some that the judges bolstered his score based on his dynamic presence and the sentimental drama of the legendary champion's return to the ice to lead the home team to gold, rather than the difficulty of his program and his execution of it.	1
The separatist group behind a series of bombings on a Spanish vacation island marks the 50 year anniversary of its struggle this year, a milestone that sees it no closer to achieving its goal. Police cordon off the route leading to the location of the latest blasts in Palma de Mallorca. ETA, which is fighting for the independence of Spain's northern Basque region, was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of Mallorca on Sunday without hurting anyone. The latest incident appears to be part of a new wave of attacks, including another in Mallorca which killed two Civil Guard officers in July, which have left a 2006 cease-fire a distant memory. The violent resurgence also defies Spanish government claims that the group's operational capabilities have been broken by a series of high profile arrests in Spain and France. ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959. The group, whose full name Euskadi Ta Askatasuna means "Basque Homeland and Freedom" in the Basque language, killed what some say was its first victim in 1968. Since then it waged a campaign of violence against the Spanish state, targeting politicians, policemen, judges and soldiers, often clocking up numerous civilian casualties with deadly car bombs. In 1980 alone ETA was blamed for 118 deaths, and in 1995 it nearly succeeded in assassinating Jose Maria Aznar, then leader of the opposition and later Spain's prime minister. On September 16, 1998, the organization declared a "unilateral and indefinite" cease-fire, raising hopes that its campaign was at an end. ETA called off the cease-fire in November 1999, however, and 2000 saw a sharp escalation in violence. Another unilateral cease-fire was declared in March 2005, with ETA raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it "permanent." It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks. At the center of the struggle is a region know as Euskal Herria in Basque. The area straddles the western end of the Pyrenees, covering 20,664 square kilometers in northern Spain and southern France. See map of territory claimed by Basque separatists	1
Walking through a hushed cemetery at night with only a flashlight to guide your way can be a stirring experience for amateur ghost hunters this Halloween. "A lot of paranormal societies use graveyards for training grounds,"  says John E. Anderson. A former investigator for San Diego Paranormal Society, he has used his investigative skills to gain inside access to some of the most haunted graveyards in San Diego County. With the permission of local cemetery management boards, Anderson was recently invited to visit the San Ysidro, Rancho Santa Fe and Mount Soledad cemeteries.Anderson was surprised by the number of ghostly details that he uncovered on his nighttime investigations of the cemeteries. "It all just seemed to pop into my head," says Anderson. The experiences included a few strange encounters with the Grim Reaper, a man who appeared to have been hanged by his neck, a cemetery official who was shot in the back by a man wearing a deer head mask, and a former caretaker who was killed by a dog.In an effort to make sense of the cemetery tour, Anderson spoke with San Diego Paranormal Society founder Robert Mays. "We all have this tendency to go to graveyards and have these experiences because so many people talk about them," says Anderson. "It does make sense that it would happen to me, but I was still surprised to find that these areas have these stories."But the most chilling story Anderson uncovered was about the San Ysidro, Rancho Santa Fe and Mount Soledad graveyards: They are the three most haunted cemeteries in San Diego County. After a recent investigation inside the Mount Soledad cemetery—a cemetery that's been in use since 1872—Anderson, a self-proclaimed ghost hunter, realized that the cemetery was just a small part of the bigger story.  "I learned that there was a whole world that didn't get told that exists near Santa Fe, or San Ysidro, or anywhere for that matter," says Anderson. "We all don't know the secrets we never knew we knew."Mount Soledad CemeterySan Diego Paranormal Society founder Robert Mays has visited every known graveyard in San Diego County. The graveyard in the Mount Soledad cemetery, located at 13200 Soledad Canyon Rd. in the northeast part of the county, has been established as a California Historical Landmark and is	0
TV sets, computers and smartphones are hard to find in Sangano, Malawi, but farmers here are using an age-old mass communication tool to learn the tricks of their trade: radio. In a country where the vast majority of the population lives off the land, scores of smallholders in rural communities tune in to Farm Radio Malawi to get valuable information and share ideas on how to improve their yields -- from fertilizing techniques and cultivation tips to harvesting practices and weather forecasts. "Most of our farmers ... are illiterate," says Rex Chapota, executive director at Farm Radio Malawi. "They're not able to read newspapers or pamphlets or booklets, and even televisions are not out there in the community. So radio is actually the only source of critical information to our farmers, and statistics are showing right now that over 60% of the rural populace at least own a radio." Farm Radio Malawi is one of the partner stations of Farm Radio International, a non-profit organization that's been teaming up with African radio broadcasters since the late 1970s. The Canada-based group offers its hundreds of partners in sub-Saharan Africa a wide array of resources, including a weekly electronic news service and an online community that connects broadcasters across the continent. It also researches and writes radio scripts covering issues such as crop production, farm management and community health. The scripts, which are offered for free, are translated in local languages and read in 38 countries, according to the group. In rural parts of Malawi, farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they've heard. "The issue of radio listeners' clubs is very critical to our model," says Chapota. "We do understand that when farmers come together in a group to listen together to a radio program, thereafter they are able to discuss and dialogue on what they've listened to and then they're able to use that in their various fields," he adds. Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, has one of the largest rural populations in the continent. Agriculture accounts for about 80% of the country's labor force, which is why local farm programming can make a big difference in people's lives.	1
Backgammon Other than chess -- the history of which is well-covered elsewhere -- the most enduring table game of the last few centuries is backgammon, also known as "tables" early in its history. Backgammon itself is  a game, not a "table game," but it has evolved to the point where it is sometimes thought of as a "game on a square" on a board of some kind. That game (called "backgammon" in the US and "game of the table" in Britain) is a simple version of a game which is centuries old. The game is played with a large sheet of paper on which the pieces are drawn in a checkerboard pattern known as a "checkerboard."A game of backgammon, or "tables," or simply "backgammon," as you like to abbreviate it, might take any of several forms. In the simplest form, a single player takes turns to make moves, using pieces to move the object of the game. A single player makes a "move" by placing the piece on the "board" of the game. Typically, the game is played with a "checkerboard" pattern, with horizontal lines of "dead" spaces on one side, and vertical lines of "live" spaces on the other.The other "player" then takes turns placing checker pieces on the squares the "player" is trying to "capture," until none of the squares are open. Or, more formally,A player's turnA player begins his or her move by placing a piece on a square of the board corresponding to the current square on the table. The squares whose sides are closed form a horizontal row of "dead" squares, while the squares whose sides are open form a vertical column of "live" squares.A player then "captures" the current square by placing a "checker" piece on it. A "checker" piece is an item that is placed on a square on the board in the same way a player's piece is placed. A game can have multiple "players" (i.e., several people taking turns to place pieces on the board). If there are multiple players, and one of the players wishes to play a "pass," the other players must agree with the first player, or the game must be declared a draw. If there are multiple players, and a	0
He's gone from being a backup dancer to the biggest thing in Asian pop culture, an actor and singer who has sold millions of albums. The 27-year-old South Korean has even faced down U.S. comedian Steven Colbert in a spoof dance-off. The comedy skit came about after Rain placed higher than him in Time Magazine's 2008 online poll of the 100 Most Influential People. As well as a sense of humor and dance moves that shook Colbert out of his satirical posture to praise, Rain is also known as one of the hardest working men in the entertainment business. Rain, real name Jung Ji-hoon,  broke into the notoriously tough world of South Korean show business with JYP Entertainment when he was just 18-years-old. He made his first mark in Hollywood last year with a role in "Speed Racer" appearing alongside Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox. As a singer with five albums to his name, he's faced thousands of screaming fans at concerts across the world, and recently he faced your questions.	1
The new-look Gmail that Google accidentally told us about last week is now rolling out to all users. The changes, officially announced in a blog post Tuesday, allow Gmail users much more control over the look of the service. You can drag sidebars around to your preferred size and width, choose from a wider selection of high-resolution background pictures, and decide whether you want lots of email on your screen or more white space between mails. (Your choice of email density is between "Comfortable," "Cozy" and "Compact.") Heavy Gmail users will also be pleased to learn that there's a new search function -- that is, you can now access Advanced Search by clicking on the search bar. Conversations have been condensed, and profile pictures added. These are more features than Google offered in its sneak peek of the new Gmail, which started in July. For now, at least, the new features will be opt-in -- and not all of us will be able to access them immediately. "If you like what you see, over the next few days you'll be able to switch to the new look by clicking on Switch to the new look in the bottom-right of Gmail," writes Google user experience designer Jason Cornwell.

Napoli missed a great chance to cut the gap on Italian league leaders AC Milan after crashing 2-0 at Chievo Verona as favored teams struggled to impress in Wednesday's games. Walter Mazzarri's second-placed team could have moved within two points after Lazio held Milan 0-0 on Tuesday, but suffered a sixth defeat in 23 Serie A games. Striker Davide Moscardelli put Chievo ahead in the 20th minute after controlling the ball well and curling a left-foot shot in off the post, and should have doubled the lead but miskicked with the goal at his mercy. Defender Gennaro Sardo netted five minutes after halftime after winning the ball and beating three men before firing home to lift his team up to 10th in the table and completed the double over Napoli after the 3-1 away victory in September. Vote for the best clubs in the world in new CNN poll Champions Inter Milan, meanwhile, can move above third-placed Lazio on goal difference with victory at bottom club Bari on Thursday, having two games in hand. Fourth-placed Roma could have gone third on Wednesday but were held 1-1 at home by second-bottom Brescia. Loan striker Marco Borriello put Claudio Ranieri's team ahead in the 58th minute, but Brazilian forward Eder equalized 11 minutes later. Juventus coach Luigi Delneri is battling to save his job after the 2-1 defeat at Palermo -- his team's fifth in eight games this year. Lazio hold leaders Milan in goalless draw Palermo moved above the Turin team into sixth place as captain Fabrizio Miccoli beat goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from a tight angle in the seventh minute and midfielder Giulio Migliaccio headed the second on 20. Claudio Marchisio reduced the deficit nine minutes before halftime after goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu  failed to deal with a corner, but the 27-time Italian champions could not equalize. Udinese dropped to seventh after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to 14th-placed Bologna. Captain Marco Di Vaio put the visitors ahead in the 65th minute, but defender Maurizio Domizzi leveled with 13 minutes to play.	1
It really depends what you want. Boy? Girl? Young? Old?" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. "We can get," he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this "unofficial" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to "foster" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his "madam" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as "sister." I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to "foster" the children. He told me, "Sister, Jesus will reward me," so the "fostering" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would "live in my heart." If I could also then find it "in my heart" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be "God's work." In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor.	1
What would you see if you could fly over Mars in a plane and look out the window? Victoria Crater as seen by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The crater is about half a mile in diameter. It must be something like the thousands of curious, intriguing and spectacular images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera mounted on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The University of Arizona, Tucson, which operates HiRISE, has just released a new batch of these photos taken in the last several months. You can check out the full set here. They reveal an alien landscape of craters, valleys, ridges, channels, weird surface patterns and other features in incredible detail. Take the stunning image on the left, which shows the muffin-cup-like Victoria Crater, a site once explored by the Mars rover Opportunity. The camera isn't looking straight down, but is pointed 22 degrees east so we get a better view of the crater's slopes, "comparable to a view from an airplane window," the university says. Looking at some of the photos, you feel like you're flying over the Grand Canyon or the Sahara. Others are distinctly extraterrestrial in nature. In all cases, the images reveal lots of details about the surface of our neighbor in the solar system. "Each full image from HiRISE covers a strip of Martian ground 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) wide, about two to four times that long, showing details as small as 1 meter, or yard, across," according to NASA's Web site. It might be the closest thing to visiting Mars without leaving your chair.	1
The American Civil Liberties Union has called on officials in Massachusetts and Florida to conduct independent investigations into the shooting death of a man by an FBI agent. Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot early May 22 during questioning about a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, as well as his relationship with deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Law enforcement from Massachusetts and Florida as well as the FBI questioned Todashev at his Florida home. Details about the circumstances of Todashev's death have been few, and the gaps have been filled in by media reports quoting unnamed law enforcement sources. The reports have raised the question about how much of a threat Todashev posed before being shot. Father: 'Unarmed' son 'not crazy' enough to attack FBI agent who killed him The FBI is conducting an investigation into the shooting, but the ACLU said that action is not enough. "Florida officials are simply deferring to the FBI, allowing the FBI to investigate itself, but it is difficult to accept the FBI's honesty in this matter," Howard Simon, ACLU of Florida's executive director, said in a statement Monday. "The FBI has offered completely incompatible explanations; they have failed to explain how these inconsistent stories found their way into newspaper accounts of the shootings, and have not offered any clarifying comment about what really happened." The rights group sent a letter to Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley asking her office to investigate the role of officers from her state in the shooting. In Florida, the ACLU asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the role of Orlando police at the scene. A U.S. government official briefed on the FBI investigation told CNN in May that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities and noted he was never arrested or handcuffed. Did missed connections in murder case open door to bombings? A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach, the U.S. official said. After one of the detectives left the room, the other noticed Todashev was acting odd, and he texted that sense to the FBI agent with him -- the U.S. official told CNN. Those two law enforcement officials were the only ones with Todashev, according to this account.	1
Eight people were killed and 17 were injured Wednesday when an improvised explosive device detonated followed by a suicide bomber's explosion, according to police and medical officials. The attacks targeted people leaving al-Mustafa Shiite mosque Ã¢ÂÂ which is near the site of a 2005 massacre of worshippers at the compound that killed at least 140 people.The explosion Ã¢ÂÂ the first one to be reported by authorities so far Ã¢ÂÂ was at the front gate of the mosque, about 200 yards from the entrance. Police said the explosion caused a fire that was doused, but left no trace of damage.According to police, gunmen wearing police uniforms opened fire on people near the mosque. The gunmen followed up with a second, two-minute-long explosion, police said. Later, police discovered a suicide bomber sitting on a motorcycle in the street two blocks from the mosque. He was identified as Abdullah Azzam al-Sharqawi, 26, also known as Abu Talha al-Almani.No one else was at the mosque at the time of the attack, police said. Police recovered four automatic weapons and a hand grenade and said they were also looking for five other suspects.Al-Sharqawi was the son of a prominent Lebanese Shiite cleric, Sheikh Muhammad al-Sharqawi Ã¢ÂÂ who was the spiritual leader of the group linked to Hezbollah Ã¢ÂÂ and father of a 17-year-old girl who was believed to be the bomber's first target in the attack.Al-Sharqawi was a wanted man, but authorities did not say whether he was a member or leader of Hezbollah's internal intelligence unit, Sayyed Ali Hassan Nasrallah. According to reports, he was in Syria, Iraq, and Iran.The mosque bombing was believed to be revenge for the 2005 killings in the village of Khaldun, about 25 miles west of Beirut, according to some reports .Following the attack, the Lebanese government canceled the annual al-Aksa conference of the Al-Mustafa Society, an Shiite movement affiliated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah leaders had been scheduled to address the conference in Doha, Qatar, where they received strong support from the Qatari government. The Qatari government has been trying to bring Hezbollah members home from Syria	0
A U.S. mining company has denied a report by Indonesia's state media that a convoy of its buses came under fire in the province of Papua Wednesday. Indonesian soldiers provide security near a PT Freeport-owned ________, seen here, in Papua where it is being sent toward the mine in Papua."They were not in any kind of difficulty," the spokesperson for Freeport, William Adams, told UPI by telephone. "They are actually very experienced in fighting fires. They are not the only ones, there are many other private security companies in the region." Freeport said soldiers were dispatched to the area early Wednesday, responding to reports that local residents there were attempting to block a convoy of buses carrying the company's equipment to the mine. Adams said that when he visited the scene on Thursday, "the fire was not as bad as I have seen from my past experience." The state Department of Forestry and the U.S. embassy are investigating a report by the state media that soldiers and police had fired on the convoy. On Thursday, Freeport representatives said soldiers were only sent to the area after the state news station reported that residents had called to say they were fighting with the convoy. The company said in a media release that soldiers "conducted high risk and extensive search operations" in order to clear the road and avoid a clash with local residents. It added that two contractors from Freeport were "actively working" in the area, but did not reveal the nature of their work or how long it had been going on. "The company does not condone any form of threat, obstruction, or any other violation of the law that may have occurred on the operation," Freeport said. "In the event that any member of the mining community in Bougainville may have witnessed or reported violations of law or human rights or any other illegal act, they are informed of the company's position and are directed to report it to the local police force."Friday, July 07, 2005The U.S. Geological Survey said Thursday that earthquakes that shook the West Coast on Thursday were not related to nuclear testing in the region. The agency said the tremor followed a series of smaller quakes that followed the 11-magnitude quake that occurred on July 4. But seismologists said they suspect the quake-triggered earthquake swarms were caused by a huge underwater quake that had not been felt on land in the U.S. so far. "We have been	0
Proving that the Wii's motion-sensing controls weren't a fad, both Sony's PlayStation Move and Microsoft's Kinect had strong holiday seasons, suggesting a growing appetite for active video games. Sony and Microsoft sold Â£1.27bn of motion controls products last year - more than double that of last year. For Sony, that helped boost second-year sales to more than Â£2.3bn, the biggest-ever for a year, and helped it become the top-selling console in the UK.But now that the Wii U is out (even if it's not out for the year), will game play like Avatar? It's a question that games industry analyst Michael Pachter is asking. "I do think the Wii U will be the biggest, and the most important, [in 2013]," he tells me. "It's still a little early for us, but we've been hearing more and more buzz about the Wii U [and the success of the PlayStation 4].""The numbers game is over," he adds. "I can see the Xbox One dominating the console market, but the Wii U is going to be a bigger and greater force in the next several years."He's not alone in that belief. Pachter believes that the success of the Wii U will be enough to force the PS4 to move over to the "more dominant" console market, and that Xbox One consoles will also enter the "mass market" by the end of this year. He argues that the Wii U's strong hardware and software has given Sony "a platform to play on" as well as a profitable place to "build a new audience for next-generation consoles", while making the PS4 unprofitable."I don't believe that Xbox One and PS4 are going to go away either," he says. "The Wii U is the biggest game-playing machine on the planet and that is a powerful platform for developers and publishers looking to distribute and brand their blockbuster titles."He is confident that the Wii U will also remain strong in the "consumer electronics box" aisle - despite the fact that Sony and Microsoft might not have anything to play until 2015. "Microsoft should be very, very worried about its future when it comes to the consumer electronics game console market," he says. "The PS4 has been on the ropes and Microsoft is still struggling to make a compelling platform."	0
Let me tell you a little about me." "Farouk1986" introduced himself to a Muslim online community with these words in February 2005. "My name is Umar but you can call me Farouk," the poster continues, detailing biographical information that appears to match the life of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive on an international flight into Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. The failed terror plot put airports on high alert and refocused American attention on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the attempted attack. Internet postings for Farouk1986 -- apparently a combination of his name and birth year -- reveal a young man who fought feelings of loneliness and struggled with balancing his life as a Muslim with the temptations of the secular world around him. He wrote about his desire to attend university, possibly in the United States, and his thoughts on love and marriage. Officials have not confirmed that Internet postings by Farouk1986 were made by AbdulMutallab, but the many detailed biographical points made by the poster match what has been reported about AbdulMutallab's life. "I will describe myself as very ambitious and determined, especially in the deen," Farouk1986 wrote in February 2005, referring to the Islamic way of life. The poster writes about being in boarding school, with possibilities of attending Stanford University or the University of California-Berkeley. Eventually, AbdulMutallab studied mechanical engineering at University College London. Besides being ambitious, Farouk1986 also described himself as lonely. "First of all, I have no friend[s]," he wrote in another online post with informal, imperfect grammar. "Not because I do not socialise (sic), etc but because either people do not want to get too close to me as they go partying and stuff while I don't. or they are bad people who befriend me and influence me to do bad things. "i have no one to speak too, no one to consult, no one to support me and i feel depressed and lonely. i do not know what to do." Somewhere along the way, AbdulMutallab turned toward Islamic extremism.	1
The Texas jury that found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty Thursday of sexual assault will deliberate again to determine his punishment. Jeffs, who represented himself after firing his defense team, remained stoic as the verdict was read. Jurors will decide his fate after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, which began Thursday evening and will continue Friday. The sect leader faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his "spiritual wives." The jury convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child -- charges that stemmed from a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott hailed the verdict and said prosecutors were seeking a life sentence for Jeffs. "Here in the state of Texas, juries render tough, swift justice against anyone who would sexually assault a child," he said. Before the verdict, witnesses showed jurors DNA evidence they said showed Jeffs conceived a baby with a 15-year-old child. And prosecutors presented an audio recording that they alleged documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in the presence of three other "wives." Abbott said attorneys were presenting new, "repulsive" evidence about the sect leader during the trial's penalty phase. "I think it will confirm in (jurors') minds why they convicted the man and why they want to put him behind bars for a long time," he said. Court adjourned about two hours after jurors reached a verdict Thursday. The trial was scheduled to continue at 10 a.m. Friday (11 a.m. ET). Jurors deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes, starting Thursday afternoon. They sent out two notes during deliberations, requesting a CD player to listen to audio recordings and asking for the transcript of testimony from a witness. Jeffs stood silently for most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday -- the latest dramatic twist in a trial that included frequent objections and sermonlike speeches about religious freedom. Jeffs stared at the table in front of him for most of his allotted block of time during closing arguments, as Judge Barbara Walther counted down. He looked up at the jury when he reached the 20-minute mark, staring at each member. The jurors stared back. Five minutes later, Jeffs mumbled, "I am at peace."	1
In the face of Republican opposition, the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama's nominee to be deputy secretary of state Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden congratulated Tony Blinken on his confirmation. "Admired in every vernacular by the American people," the Obama White House said in a statement, "Tony has the proven experience and deep knowledge needed to serve the nation with distinction as our nation's next secretary of state."On April 29, 2009, Mr. Blinken wrote to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging his confirmation to head up the State Department. "The confirmation of a new secretary of state is in everyone's interest," he wrote in his March, 2009, letter to the Committee. "It is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly." He also called it a "sacrosanct constitutional function" since international relations are in the hands of the president. But his support for the nomination seemed to vanish overnight as the Republican party held its annual national convention in Tampa, Fla. Mr. McCain, for example, said he would refuse to meet with Mr. Obama because of the nominee.But Mr. Blinken remained a constant in support of Mr. Obama's efforts in the confirmation process.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Blinken said the confirmation hearings went well. “The hearings for my nomination were very positive, professional and on point,” he said. “My nomination was supported by both parties.”The president nominated Blinken - who has been deputy undersecretary of state since 2004 - to be the State Department's second-in-command. He replaces Hillary Clinton who left to focus on her White House bid.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement, said it “found the nominee to be a capable and hardworking assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasia at the State Department.” The committee noted his experience in Europe and the “expertise he brought to the portfolio” as assistant secretary.The committee noted his experience in Europe, including a role as ambassador to the EU from 2005 to 2007 under former President George W. Bush.“The nominee is well qualified for this position and is well-equipped to serve as the next assistant secretary of State,” the committee said. “The Committee also recommends his confirmation.”Mr. Obama nominated Blinken for the position in January 2009. He won confirmation from the Senate Foreign Relations	0
Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger was reunited Wednesday with both survivors and rescuers at the scene of the remarkable emergency landing of U.S. Airways flight 1549 five years ago on the Hudson Frontenac Lake.Two survivors of the crash, Richard Roe and Dawn Hochsprung, said they were overcome with gratitude after learning that the pilot of the Airbus 320, Sully Sullenberger, was there to meet them.It was a day for the ages for both survivors and rescuers on the ice of the Hudson Frontenac.There was celebration, too, when the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that it was the first time in its history it had identified the cockpit voice recorder as the device that had helped investigators track down the flight recorders.The cockpit voice recorder was found wedged between seats in the plane's right seat, the same seat as the flight instructor and stewardesses who told everyone that the plane was too heavy to fly.When the cockpit voice recorder was opened, its voice made it clear what had transpired."We did not lose cabin pressure and we did not depressurize the airplane," the cockpit voice recorder revealed."We don't know what happened," the voice from the cockpit agreed.Roe and his brother, Eric, now 39, were in the back seat of a rented van, en route to Toronto, waiting for the ferry carrying their parents, Mike and Nancy, to return to the United States.They were en route from a family reunion in Michigan, and arrived at the hotel only a short time before the ferry. They had booked the hotel room under the assumed name of Kevin Roe.But the brothers couldn't believe their luck when the hotel's phone bill showed the calls had been made to room 4 at the Westin in Boston, with a note on the pay phone reading: "Mr. Kevin Roe and Richard Roe."On Wednesday morning, Roe was watching television at the hotel when the news came that Mr. Sullenberger had been arrested in Florida for crashing the plane.There was a bit of confusion at first, but with his parents present, Sullenberger told them what had happened.They were relieved, said Roe."It was just the best possible thing that could've happened to us," he said.As	0
More than a quarter-million American women served honorably in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. These brave women sacrificed much to keep us safe. Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them  continue to heal.We owe them this, and we owe our own healing and reconciliation process as well.For many years, the public has been able to see the women who have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following combat tours of duty, the symptoms that are indicative of PTSD. Some of the more extreme symptoms include depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and extreme rage.A growing number of women also are coming forward with stories of having been sexually assaulted while in war zones.We also have increasing numbers of female veterans who are coming forward with experiences of combat deployment, sexual assault and war.I have been honored to meet, and to talk with, scores of military women who have volunteered their time, patience, talent and energy to heal and to heal themselves as well.They have been extraordinary. They are extraordinary because they have become like sisters to us, and we have become sisters to them.Many of these women never left their families for the war zones. They never were the poster children and the heroines and the models that we wanted to emulate. And now, after a war takes these women on, they become a different breed.I have met and spoken with many such women who have undergone very long recovery processes, who have been through painful relapses and relapses of the PTSD symptoms, who had to overcome long periods of drug and alcohol addiction, who still are plagued by many of the same fears and guilt that gave rise to the PTSD in the first place.But these women are not only making it. They are learning to live with the effects of the war trauma, of the physical pain, of the emotional pain. They are learning how to be and to heal.Some of them become like sisters to us. Some become good role models for our children and the children of their children and the children of their children.So I am very pleased that we have passed another milestone in our nation’s efforts to heal the wounds of war, because one key factor in this process is the support of our troops.After their deployment, troops who have been through our country’s long and courageous process of	0
On the same day the United States announced the arrest of a 19-year old attempting to leave the country to join ISIS, a top State Department official said the American efforts to combat ISIS' powerful online vernacular, the "kill list" and the propaganda that it generates, were expanding.The president's top diplomat described the ISIS propaganda campaign as the biggest and most effective challenge the United States has faced in fighting Al Qaeda.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been the most high-priority act of the Trump administration so far."This is the first time that we have brought somebody from Daesh, Al Qaeda's branch, to justice. And I think everybody has been quite impressed with that," Earnest said. "I think it's an indication of a significant shift in priorities in our country."The killing of Baghdadi, who the United States had publicly designated a global terrorist, has been the biggest priority for the Trump administration so far, although he had been expected to be killed soon after a video surfaced showing the beheaded corpse of a US soldier.The killings of top terrorists — including the 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden — had been the main focus of the administration during the eight months since Trump took office.Earnest described Baghdadi as a "key financier" of Al Qaeda's international network and a man who "was responsible for the finances and the leadership of terrorist groups globally. Baghdadi was responsible for funding and directing terrorist activities." He was also known for directing "international terrorist operations" in Iraq, he said."What I think is most impressive about this operation is the extent of the global reach," Earnest said. "It is a global network, and for folks to see this beheading itself in front of the world is an indication that we are responding to it," he said.The announcement of the al-Baghdadi death "is a major achievement, but it's not the only achievement," Earnest added later after a question about the US campaign against ISIS online had been posed."There's no question that in order to counter this threat, that we have to address the online component of it," Earnest said. "It is the largest and most powerful weapon that we have in this fight. And it's an example of how we're really winning."	0
A blind man and his black Lab service dog fell onto subway tracks and escaped injury Tuesday after an alert Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee instructed them to duck ahead of an oncoming train. The incident happened around 9:30 a.m. at the 125th Street station in Harlem, according to Marisa Baldeo, spokeswoman for the MTA. The blind man, identified by CNN affiliate NY1 as Cecil Williams, was walking on the subway platform with his service dog when witnesses describe him slipping and falling onto the tracks. "I heard a man say 'Oh no!,' and I heard him fall into the train tracks," witness Danya Guiterez told CNN affiliate WPIX. "I was in shock and everyone ran towards him, but no one went in the train tracks." A nearby MTA employee, described by Baldeo as a construction flagger, jumped into action and tried to calm the man. The MTA employee instructed Williams to lie still between the subway rails and not try and climb out as a northbound "A" train quickly approached the station, according to Baldeo. Customers standing on the platform attempted to alert the conductor, according to a statement from the MTA. The conductor applied the brakes when he noticed Williams on the tracks, but the train came to a stop only after one and a half cars went over the man and his dog. Firefighters Ralph Costello, George Gerrish and Spencer Presume arrived on scene and noticed Williams was underneath the second subway car but not pinned. They jumped onto the tracks and removed him by a backboard. They said the man was just semicoherent and only managed to give his name and ask about his service dog, which was also safe and uninjured. He said little else, according to a Fire Department of New York press release. "It's a miracle," Williams' girlfriend, who only wished to only give her first name, Cynthia, told CNN affiliate NY. Cynthia told NY1 that Williams fainted and fell over into the tracks but was expected to be fine. "He's doing great," Cynthia said. "He's on observation. I'm very grateful to God." Cynthia added that Williams' dog, who she identified as 10-year-old Orlando, was OK and going home with her.	1
Nationalists held a narrow lead in Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, the country's election commission said Monday. Of the 87 percent of the votes counted by Monday morning, the Ata Zhurt party had won 8.6 percent, said Nuriya Iskanderova, a consultant for the commission. The other four main parties followed with narrow margins separating them. The pro-government SDPK (Social-Democratic Party of  Kyrgyzstan)  won 7.97 percent of the counted votes; followed by the Arnamys Party (7.12 percent); the Republic Party (7.02 percent) and the Atameken Party (5.94 percent). The election commission has to announce final results within two  weeks, said Klara Sooromkulova, a member of the election commission. Voters in the Central Asian nation went to the polls Sunday to elect a new parliament. The elections come after a year that has seen the president flee the country and ethnic riots that left hundreds dead. International monitors did not report any major complaints on election day, though local observers from the political parties were more vocal with their concerns, Sooromkulova said. Voter turnout was high, especially in the south of the country, she said, including a 56 percent turnout in the capital, Bishkek. The new government will have to rebuild "the entire infrastructure of the government, as well as the rebuilding of social cohesion and trust between ethnic groups," said Kanat Saudabayev, a top official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed in April and was replaced by Roza Otunbayeva, who became the first female president of a Central Asian nation. Two months later, at least 356 people were killed and about 400,000 fled their homes in a wave of violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. Shortly after that, Kyrgyz voters approved a new constitution that puts more power in the hands of parliament, reducing the president's role. "Following the June situation of unrest and violence, it was not easy to organize the elections," Sooromkulova said. Kyrgyzstan hosts a United States air base which is an essential supply route for NATO personnel and equipment into Afghanistan, called Manas Transit Center, as well as a Russian military base, Kant, just outside of the capital Bishkek.	1
Andrew Brannan, 66, who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22-year-old Georgia sheriff's deputy in 1998, is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional. His defense attorneys claim Â“the State of Georgia has no power to impose the death penalty . . . on a human being [for the death of deputy James "Jim" Giddens] who was not executed . . . [and] cannot constitutionally impose the death penalty on a non-human animal."Judge Elisha C. Howard ruled that the current statutes governing capital punishment do not allow for the punishment of Brannan or any other nonhuman animal, which in fact makes up an awful lot of them around this globe. On the other hand, it's not entirely clear what exactly is unique about the punishment. The U.S. Constitution leaves it up to each state to determine how capital punishment will be carried out, and some may have the right to impose it, but this court has ruled twice in the past that those states are not allowed to carry out the punishment on an animal. Brannan's lawyer, George Rekers, has even gone so far as to claim that the death of Brannan isn't even necessary in order to punish Giddens for what he did.While the Georgia Supreme Court (in 2006 and again in 2007) ruled that a person must be specifically convicted of murdering Giddens, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision. The Court ruled that the punishment must be found to be the necessary and proportional result for the crime itself, not just for the person who committed that crime.For instance, a man might be sentenced for the murder of a human being. That man's sentence would be to be held in a state-run prison for several decades. The judge overseeing the case would have to find that holding the person in prison for his crime was the right thing to do to protect the public. The judge could look at many factors, such as the person's crimes, his prior record, his mental health, etc., but a key part of the judge would have to find that the person was serving his punishment as a necessary and proportional punishment for the crime he committed. This is what Judge Howard has done.Brannan, one of the most infamous serial killers in American history, was given life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1998	0
I know what you're thinking: What do Justin Timberlake and I have in common? First, we're both responsible for bringing sexy back. Second, we're both standing up to cancer on Friday. Why? Well, I don't know Justin's connection to cancer, but I do know mine. I lost both of my grandfathers, an uncle and numerous friends to cancer. Additionally, my mother is a cancer survivor. (First, uterine cancer, and then kidney cancer.) And I know that all the stars who are coming out Friday night and all the viewers at home have been personally touched by cancer in some way. They've seen the havoc the disease can wreak on a person's life, family, friends and immune system. No matter who you are, how wealthy you are, how famous you are, cancer will find a way into your life, affecting you or someone you love. Every day, 1,600 Americans die from cancer. Eight million people worldwide will die this year from the disease.  In the U.S., one in every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetimes. Stand Up to Cancer is a movement designed to get top researchers from the best medical centers focused on highly specialized projects aimed at bringing new treatments to people faster and making everyone diagnosed with cancer a survivor. We're gearing up for a national election, yet it's rare to hear leaders from either major political party say anything about cancer. We, the people, must.  It's why for years now, I've "spontaneously" showed up at baseball games and other events to support cancer research and on the Friday after Labor Day, I put on one of those fancy T-shirts and stand up to cancer with my friends from film, TV, music and sports. Say what you want about the entertainment industry (and, really, what hasn't been said?) but on this one, we're getting it right. For all the issues and problems facing us all right now, this is one of the most pressing. It's also one of the most promising.	1
European Champions League holders Bayern Munich have been drawn to face Manchester City in the group stages of the continent's most prestigious club competition. The German champions are now led by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, who secured 14 trophies for the Catalan club during his four seasons in charge. Guardiola has a hard task repeating Bayern's feats of last season when under Jupp Heynckes they won the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League crowns. At the draw in Monaco, Bayern's Franck Ribery was also named European Footballer of the Year, beating Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid. "It's always nice to win this trophy; it's a special moment for me to be here," he said. "It was an extraordinary year for us, we'd wanted that trophy for so long and to play at Wembley was fantastic. I think Bayern deserved to win the cup after such a long time." Despite huge investment in their playing squad, and winning the English Premier League title in 2012, Manchester City have failed to make it out of the group stages in the past two Champions League competitions. Russian club CSKA Moscow and Viktoria Plzen, from the Czech Republic, complete the line-up in Group D. Spanish champions Barcelona have been drawn in a particularly tough looking group alongside Italian giants AC Milan, Dutch title winners Ajax and Scottish champions Celtic. Celtic famously beat Barcelona in the group stages of last year's competition, and booked their place in the group stages with a last-gasp victory over Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan on Wednesday night. English side Arsenal face a tough test to emerge from Group F alongside last year's beaten finalists, Borussia Dortmund of Germany, Napoli from Italy and French side Marseille. Carlo Ancelotti's first Champions League campaign as manager of Real Madrid sees him face Italian champions Juventus, Galatasaray from Turkey, and Denmark's FC Copenhagen. Jose Mourinho has been handed a favorable draw in Group E as Europa League winners Chelsea pulled German side Schalke, FC Basel from Switzerland and Romanian outfit Steaua Bucharest. English Premier League champions Manchester United will also be content with their draw in Group A as they face Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk, Germany's Bayer Leverkusen and Real Sociedad from Spain.	1
Ask Steve "Lips" Kudlow how his band, Anvil, overcame bad management, a dead colleague, cruddy jobs, unpaid tour bills, raging arguments and now mockery as a Spinal Tap clone, and he has one word: Ã¢â¬ÅFuck!Ã¢âÃ¢â¬ÅFuck, fuck, fuck, FuckÃ¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦Ã¢â¦"My old friend was always asking me if I wanted to sing with the rock group Anvil. I always told him, 'Nah, I don't want to sing with them.' You need someone in the choir before you can get in the door to rock. And that someone always has to be someone other than me! That's where I was wrong. I thought it would be easy, that's where I was wrong. I thought, 'Man, all I have to do is find someone who'll put up with what I have to do.' Someone who's been where all these guys have, someone who can't tell the difference between us and the bands we're singing on.

Anvil's sound is as hard-hitting and confrontational as that of the band Mötley Crüe. But Anvil is about so much more: Lips is one of the few men in the business today who can relate to it. He is more than a fan: he is a friend and a mentor. And he's about to find out why."I thought he wouldn't get it at first," Lips tells me when I meet him by phone from his home office in the foothills of San Diego.

I don't know if I've watched too many scary movies lately, but I've been pondering natural burial alternatives for dearly departed pets. I know eco-sensitive burial methods are increasingly popular with humans, but I wasn't  able to learn of any such methods for deceased pets. So, I decided to investigate whether burying a pet in the ground could be an animal-friendly alternative. Since animals do not have a very good sense of smell, it would be difficult to do a full autopsy and determine cause of death if they were buried. Perhaps the best option would be to simply leave them at a place where they will always be found: their house! I also do not know if burying a pet would qualify as an "animal-friendly" alternative.If a pet is buried "under the earth," how much of the body would they have to dig out of the ground to be able to return to normal? Also, would that really be a "burial" under the ground, at least in the sense that it's not being buried to a new home or a new cemetery? What happens if the pet's grave collapses, or worse, is destroyed by vandals or the elements?What I mean by animal-friendly is that it can be done in a way that minimizes damage to the pet's body. For example, it could be done in a way that makes it as quick and painless as possible, such as having the animal's body returned to its original position. Also, it could be done in a way that limits the amount of dirt that would have to be thrown into the grave before the body is returned intact to the pet.The first part of this series was supposed to last about 10 minutes, but I've decided to make a series of videos to follow up on this topic, especially since there are so many different ways a pet could be buried or, more specifically, a natural burial.I should mention first that if your pet is buried, it's best to use a natural burial method that will preserve as much of the pet as possible. If the body is too decomposed to use a pet casket, you could pour the body out of the grave in a tub of water and return the body to its original position. In that case, the body doesn't have to be returned to its original position in the ground. If the body is too decomposed to allow a c	0
A judge has ruled in favor of two Florida school administrators who faced contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon, according to a group that helped represent them. Rep. Mike McIntyre is one of three members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus  that filed the suit.Judge Robert H. Cleland of the federal district court in Tallahassee said the school district should make "the choice between incurring contempt costs and losing an opportunity for prayer at public school lunches, or incurring contempt costs in exercising a constitutional right to which it appears to be entitled." The ruling follows an earlier ruling in favor of three school board members who were accused of using “sectarian prayers.”The four-term congressman, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, said "no religion should be excluded from the public square" and that school districts should follow the law regarding "sectarian prayers.""The Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the vast majority of Americans agree that prayer in public schools is not only constitutionally permissible but a crucial part of the educational process," McIntyre said in a statement. "We look forward to this lawsuit being finally resolved, and the American people finally being able to know whether prayer is part of a school's routine or just another attempt to 'de-obstruct.' "The ruling came as a civil rights group filed a separate motion on behalf of the two school board members who were accused of using "sectarian prayers," saying there was no evidence any prayer was offered in a sectarian manner. The lawsuit sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the board members from invoking "a specific faith in public school assemblies."A number of other lawsuits have been filed, but the one challenging the prayer at the school luncheon has gone to court before. A federal judge in Tallahassee ruled in favor of a former school board member in 2013, declaring that a sectarian prayer given at a school board meeting at the St. Joseph Parish School District in New Orleans was unconstitutional.The case in the federal court in Florida over the luncheon prayer case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Religious Freedom Association.The two-page ruling in the school board members' favor will be posted this afternoon and will become part of the court record.	0
For consumers, the news that the Department of Justice is suing Apple and several publishers, accusing them of price-fixing, boils down to one kitchen-table question: Will this mean my e-books will get cheaper? The short answer? More than likely, yes. But the long-term ramifications of the move remain murkier, with some arguing that prices will ultimately rise because of it. Wednesday's lawsuit centers around the 2010 release of the iPad, when the government alleges Apple colluded with six major publishing houses to raise prices on digital books. At the time, Amazon's Kindle was far and away the dominant device for e-books and Amazon forced publishers to sell most books on the devices for $9.99. Publishers argued that price was too low and, according to the Justice Department, went to Apple in 2009 looking for a way to force Amazon's hand. iPad books ultimately sold for closer to $12.99; as part of their deal with Apple, publishers only offered their books to other retailers at the same prices. After a couple of days, Amazon caved and allowed publishers to set their own prices as well. "This action drove up e-book prices virtually overnight," said Sharis Pozen, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, at a news conference on Wednesday. "Let me be clear: When companies enter agreements that prevent price competition, that is illegal." The three publishers who have already settled with the government -- HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette -- agreed to tear up current contracts and renegotiate pricing with outlets like Amazon and Barnes & Noble, whose Nook is one of the other most popular e-readers. So, what happens now? Amazon wasted no time suggesting that its prices will be dropping soon. "This a big win for Kindle owners and we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books," an Amazon spokesman said via e-mail. That, too, will presumably lead to lower prices. And it only stands to reason that Apple would have to eventually follow suit. Apple declined to comment to CNN for this story. But some say Amazon's lower prices have been the problem all along.	1
The next step after exposing the world of male strip clubs? Descending into a bordello-themed New Orleans vernacular of filth, sex and profanity.The next step after exposing the world of male strip clubs? Descending into a bordello-themed New Orleans vernacular of filth, sex and profanity.The latest chapter in New Orleans' never-ending love affair with the sex industry.A new strip club in New Orleans is taking on the city's reputation as the porn capital of the world and is adding a whole new dimension of filth, sex and profanity to its menu.The establishment is called Follies at the Orleans, and it has opened its doors to the city's porno elite.They're serving hot dogs and fried chicken in the front of the club and a hot-pink-themed menu in the back."We have a very hip crowd, who want to go there for that little bit of edge," said owner, Bobby White."What we're doing is not as graphic as the Strip Club on Carrollton Square, but it's still very erotic."White is expecting an influx of porn fans to the club's first day, with a few more to follow afterwards."It should be a great night," said White."The best crowd is a happy crowd. And that's what they're going to get here."The Orleans is the only male strip club in New Orleans. Its main stage, dubbed the "Cotton Box," is a 6,000-seat dance hall-cum-bar with a black-and-white checkerboard floor, an elevated stage and walls adorned in old-time showmen's portraits.Its only female dancer -- whose name is T-Bird -- is a former child star named Jasmina."She's a lot of fun. She has fun with everything," said White."She's a classic stripper. She does great dances. She's beautiful. And she's a good dancer."T-Bird said she loves the New Orleans lifestyle, which is part of what motivated her to open a club in the city.	0
Surely, not. Sometimes things happen that propel a palm to your head. You just ask aloud, "Really?" With the brightest of spotlights on the NFL -- and its handling of domestic violence issues threatening to tarnish the shield that represents the most profitable and popular sports league in the country -- you'd think the nation's pro football players would be on their best behavior. So, it sparks a little incredulity when -- on the heels of five players' arrests, the indefinite suspension of a premier running back and the deactivation of two of the NFL's biggest stars -- yet another NFL player is alleged to have exacted violence against loved ones. As women's groups demand change from the top down -- and one group is demanding the ouster of Commissioner Roger Goodell and flying banners over stadiums that say, "#GoodellMustGo" -- the bad news kept piling on the National Football League on Wednesday. Jonathan Dwyer walked off the Arizona Cardinals' practice field and into the backseat of a Phoenix police cruiser after multiple allegations of felony assault. It was the latest public relations debacle for the NFL, as Dwyer brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six, after July incidents in which police say he broke his wife's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face. Here is a quick look at those players and their travails. Adrian Peterson One of the top players in the NFL, he left the Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in Texas. Peterson had been deactivated by the Vikings and missed Sunday's game, then reactivated Monday. But the team said it needed to correct its mistake and deactivated him again. Peterson then took a leave of absence and Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues. At no point has Peterson been suspended. Greg Hardy The Carolina Panthers' defensive star also took a leave of absence because of legal troubles. As with Peterson, Hardy will be paid while he is away from the team. Hardy was convicted by a judge in July on misdemeanor assault charges. He asked for a new trial in front of a jury, which is scheduled for mid-November. Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues.	1
You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed "Year of the Woman," the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women. And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama's State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators -- all Republicans, all men -- voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders. And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men. Just think: A few hours before Rubio was to deliver a message reflecting a new Republican Party, he casts a vote that screams more of the same. The jokes about him fidgeting like a 5-year-old and chugging water during the rebuttal will eventually go away. But if he's seriously thinking about running in 2016, that one vote is going to come back to haunt him. Especially if a revitalized Hillary Clinton, and her 18 million cracks in the ceiling, is in the race. Domestic violence vote key test of more inclusive GOP In a statement, he said he "could not support the final, entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences. Specifically, this bill would mandate the diversion of a portion of funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs, although there's no evidence to suggest this shift will result in a greater number of convictions." The Senate-version of reauthorization extends protections to Native Americans, gays and lesbians, and immigrants. It would allow the prosecution of non-Native Americans for abusing Native American women. Regarding that, Rubio said he voted against the bill because of "concerns regarding the conferring of criminal jurisdiction to some Indian tribal governments over all persons in Indian country, including non-Indians." Translation: From a political standpoint, Rubio blew it long before he lunged off-camera to grab a swig of water. And Democrats wasted little time pointing this out. GOP's Rubio rips Obama Voting against a bill to help women because you're not happy about the amount of money being spent on domestic violence vs. sexual assault is splitting some pretty fine hairs and just isn't choosing the right fight.

Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset al-Megrahi is "a very sick man," but there is no way to tell how long he will live, according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight  from New York to London.Hani al-Zoubi told CNN's "Inside Politics" on Sunday that his son would be "sick for the rest of [his] life." He said his father was in shock over the death of his son, Mohammed Zoubi, who was the only child of his first wife, who died of cancer the week before the plane crashed in 1988.Hani al-Zoubi described his son as "a very normal person" who never met or went to war with Megrahi.His son died along with 260 other people in the disaster that led to one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history."He was very strong, very brave," Zoubi told CNN. "He loved books; he was very knowledgeable about science and history. He was very kind to people."Zoubi said that since the disaster, he has been haunted by visions of the disaster and by nightmares about flying bombs and explosions."I always cry a lot, when I see the footage of the bombs falling on that plane," he said. "I feel that pain day and night. When I think about my son, he is at peace now. He is a very sick man. He will be for the rest of his life sick. It's a shame that he has passed away this way."Speaking from his home in Amman, Jordan, Zoubi said that he wants to help Megrahi's family. He said that some of the family's friends in Lebanon tried to get help for Megrahi, who lived in Qatar, since his death but that they were turned away."The whole world is talking about his death," Zoubi said.Hani al-Zoubi, who was an engineer before he began working in medical science, said his family wants to help those who lost loved ones in the disaster."We want to help them. We want to get back to them, so they can build their lives," he said.Family members told CNN that "they are angry and are devastated at the fact	0

The world wants to like America. The guiding values that Thomas Jefferson articulated so eloquently -- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- resonate strongly around the world, transcending countless superficial and cultural differences, not because these are American values, but because they are universal values, embedded in the human heart. Americans must outgrow the unbecoming arrogance that leads us to assert that America somehow owns a monopoly on goodness and truth -- a belief that leads some to view the world as but a stage on which to play out the great historical drama: the United States of America versus the Powers of Evil. The language of good versus evil is precisely the language of the fundamentalists whose worldview we oppose. Once we define as evil those who counter us, we lose the moral high ground and begin to descend an exceedingly slippery ethical slope. Sufis teach that we first must battle and destroy the evil within ourselves by shining upon it the good within, and then we learn to battle the evil in others by helping their higher selves gain control of their lower selves. TED.com: Robert Wright explains where compassion comes from To battle the evil of others by responding in kind and exhibiting equally violent aggressive behavior is to flout the very ethic of our religious traditions; it is also to violate the Geneva conventions, international law, the United Nations, world opinion, and even our own Bill of Rights. If we truly believe that God is on our side, rather than making sure that we are on God's side, we slip into the illusion that sees no measure as too extreme -- a delusion that captivates every extremist heart. We have two powerful tools with which to bridge the chasm separating the United States from the Muslim world: faith in the basic goodness of humanity and trust in the power of sincerity and dialogue to overcome differences with our fellow human beings. This faith and this trust are taught by all the Abrahamic traditions. They define the Abrahamic ethic, which lies at the core of our American Declaration of Independence, and America needs to rely more heavily on them, as do our fellow actors on the stage of history. TED.com: Rev. James Forbes on learning compassion at the dinner table What's right with America and what's right with Islam have a lot in common. At their highest levels, both worldviews reflect an enlightened recognition that all of humankind shares a common Creator -- that we are, indeed, brothers and sisters.	1
At one point in the 2012 presidential campaign, each of Mitt Romney's tweets had to be approved by nearly two dozen aides in the lead-up to the Republican's loss to President Barack Obama, a new ersatz crisis for the Romney campaign.As the dust is settling on that campaign and preparing for Mitt Romney's next one in 2016, the candidate's Twitter feed is now a reflection of his views on a wide range of subjects. And his top advisers continue to rely on advice from Twitter, a medium that Romney has used to speak directly to voters and to interact with people around the globe.Romney is not shy about engaging on Twitter, which he began to use in 2011. But while Trump uses Twitter as a platform for attacking his political opponents, Romney has instead used it to promote his agenda.He will often post responses to the tweets of his constituents or to news about America's military. But he also often asks or suggests questions to his followers on Twitter, and he uses the network to discuss foreign policy and social issues.Romney's tweets are now among some of the most popular in the world. He has nearly 1.1 million followers, as of Tuesday morning, according to his campaign.Here are the most-read tweets of the year that Romney has posted on Twitter so far. All times are Eastern time.Monday, August 9, 2015In the latest installment of "The Week A Political Commentator Pitches," this time on Fox News, Republican political consultant Grover Norquist made a clear argument against the idea of a government bailout of the U.S. financial sector.Norquist, a staunch libertarian who was a founding father of the modern conservative movement, said it is better for taxpayers to simply not bail out the banks while the economy is still in a free-fall."The problem has always been the government intervention," he said. "It's been a fundamental problem with the American economy."Norquist argued that the government should instead be focusing on things like infrastructure spending and education reform."When I hear some of these politicians say we need to get some government spending in the economy, I say 'Not for me, thanks' -- if you can't afford to pay for a loaf of bread, I'm not interested in spending the loaf of bread on the roof of Grandma's house," he said.

Holders Bayern Munich equaled the record for successive Champions League wins held by their manager Pep Guardiola's former side Barcelona as they reached the knockout stages Tuesday. Bayern eased past Czech champions  ASV Ditzingen 4-0 in the last 16 second leg of their quarterfinals as Guardiola's team became the first team ever to open up a three-leg series in the knockout stages of the competition with one win from the last two. Bayern Munich beat ASV Ditzingen 3-0 at home in the first leg to knock them out of the competition. The result meant Bayern also eclipsed the record of five successive Champions League wins set by Bayern in 2012 when they won a seven-year cycle. It is the 13th consecutive season they have won at least one title (after losing in 2015)."We've had a fantastic run," said Bayern captain Thiago Alcantara. "We've done it so many times before, but we knew that we can give ourselves a good chance, and we were ready to take it." Coach Pep Guardiola put an emphasis on team play in the first leg against the Bundesliga rivals. "We played one-against-one in the first leg, but the first half was really difficult physically. We lost a lot of players this offseason. I thought that it was important that we played from the back, without [foul] calls. That was important for us -- especially that we were able to play with freedom."Guardiola, who is back coaching in the final year of his contract with the Bavarian club, said that he will be able to work well with their "young players" as Bayern prepares to meet Barcelona in the semifinals. "We will see in the end if it's possible to win this tournament with my team. Bayern are a very good team, and they will be a difficult competitor," he said.Bayern reached the semifinals for the second time in three years, and for the first time since 2012 when they won the league in a record 27 games. Last season, they were knocked out in the Champions League round of 16 after losing 2-1 at Real Madrid in the first leg. Bayern have won four consecutive Bundesliga titles and four consecutive cups, winning the league for the first time in 32 years after a 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the final.Lukas N the 5th/16th: 1-0ASV Ditzingen coach Markus	0
On Friday Italy held a national day of mourning. For this is not simply an accident. Accidents and emergencies cannot last two decades.  As a field researcher who has dedicated years of work to maritime migration, and as an Italian citizen, I am grateful to the Italian Council of Ministers for taking such an unprecedented decision to make this declaration. Today we honor the memory and the families of more than 100 refugees, young adults, women, and children from Eritrea, retrieved off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa; and of the many dozens who are still trapped at the bottom of the sea. We also honor the selfless work of the island's residents, tourists, armed forces, medical personnel, and fishermen who have now rescued thousands on their way to Europe. But I have listened uncomfortably to national and EU politicians who, as usual, have pointed their finger at smugglers, purporting that redoubling efforts to fight them will prevent further loss of life at sea. People at the helm of unseaworthy vessels are menial laborers executing the last and risky part of trips organized by transnational criminal networks. Smugglers are not the reason why people are on those vessels. Italian and EU institutions are asking what can be done to prevent further tragedies. To answer, they have to ask also whether they did anything to enable them in the first place, including failing to consider implications and alternatives of their specific actions and inactions. I need to raise a seemingly simple question. What brings thousands of people to trust criminals, pay them 10 times more than they would pay a comfortable seat on a ferry or airplane, and risk their lives? The overarching answer, in its brutal obviousness, is that they may not legally get on those planes and ferries. They come from countries, such as Eritrea, that methodically oppress their own citizens and will not grant passports and exit visas. They are refugees, forced to leave home without the time and resources to secure legal passage. They have survived the Sahara, and returning from Libya or Egypt is not a feasible and rational option. They are poor. They fail to offer the financial guarantees requested by European consulates, and will not be granted a visa.	1
The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday told 149 regional airports across the country it would begin closing their air traffic control towers in April, but said it would spare another 40 towers that had been on the chopping block. The agency said Â in a press release it would “begin on Monday, April 25, with the closure of the remaining 50 towers that met our criteria to meet the needs of the marketplace.”The FAA also took aim at a second group of local airports, saying it would begin closing towers at more of the 49 other airports that “are not in the top 50 busiest and were not included in the earlier announcement.” Those locations include airports in Tennessee, Indiana, and western Kentucky. It said it would “begin on the next scheduled maintenance shutdown (April 26) with the closure of the remaining 35 towers at these unprofitable airports for the remainder of the year.”The agency further announced it was temporarily suspending the daily flight plan system at the 49 airports that were initially targeted for closure. It said it would “proactively suspend the daily flight plan system at all airports during the next three to four weeks, to complete the review and to provide a better experience for travelers through those airports.”“To ensure that the towers are in the best possible condition to be reopened quickly and safely, the FAA recommends that all current tower operators work with their tower manager to determine the most cost-effective solution for relocating the tower,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced in a statement.The FAA also said it was extending the deadline for the final decision on whether to close a tower that met the FAA’s criteria to a minimum of 60 days. Currently, the deadline was March 31.“In the meantime, we want to give customers and employees at these 40 towers a comfortable transition to their alternative airport,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a release. “We have met with many of these airport communities and will continue to work, informally, with their aviation stakeholders to assist in their transition. We anticipate that this transition will be a smooth and successful one for these communities.”In addition to the 49 airports, the FAA said it has opened a site-wide appeal to the remaining 149 airports.The announcement comes weeks after a federal court in Washington, D.C. ruled the FAA had acted ir	0
Rescuers have yet to find any survivors or bodies Saturday after a landslide that buried 83 workers at a gold mine in Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChuitoÃ¢â‚¬Â township in the eastern province of Sierra Leone.The government-run Sierra Leone Press Association said the collapse on Sunday night triggered a "mass fatality" but was not believed to be related to an epidemic of the Ebola virus.The death toll from the disaster has climbed to 13, but the cause of the landslide and of the casualties remains unknown. The landslide happened near a highway that links the capital Freetown to the gold mining village of Chuito."The government is coordinating the search for the victims of the landslide and we are trying to confirm the cause of the landslide and death toll," Sierra Leonian Interior Minister, Joseph Mosala said in a telephone interview Saturday."We have not yet found any bodies yet," he said, describing the effort to find survivors as "a massive tragedy in itself". Many victims, Mosala added, will have to be buried with relatives.Rescuers have so far discovered 10 of the 87 miners who were inside the collapsed mine, and the whereabouts of only six miners remain uncertain.The Sierra Leone government said Saturday that it has established a field hospital and is ready to receive victims as soon as the government reaches out to local chiefs to help coordinate the search and rescue operation.A total of 87 miners were working in the mine when it collapsed.An international response was requested after reports of people trapped in the gold mine went viral on social media sites such as Facebook.Local villagers have since offered to use their mining expertise to help the Sierra Leone government reach out to the thousands of residents in the area."The government has contacted us and we are ready to help them," John Kajeh, a local leader, told the BBC. "Many of our people are involved in the mining industry, so we are ready to help."While the exact cause of the landslide is still unclear, officials have reported that the victims were probably buried by a sudden explosion.The Sierra Leone government said the explosion occurred due to an improperly sealed entrance to the mine that led to gas buildup."A team of experts has been dispatched immediately to help with the search and rescue so that we can find	0
More than 30 people were killed Monday in southeastern Kenya in the latest outbreak of tribal violence. A mob of more than 300 people descended on the village of Kilelengwani in the remote Tana Delta on Monday, many of them armed with spears and machetes, the Kenya Red Cross said. Thirty-three men, women and children were killed, including seven police officers who had been deployed to the area as a buffer between warring tribes. The massacre comes just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit-for-tat violence that erupted last month. The violence is blamed on the Pokomo and Orma tribes prevalent in the region. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds. There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute. More than 50 people were killed in that attack, mostly women and children. The revenge attacks are the worst violence in Kenya since more than a thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless after a disputed election in late 2007. Kenya's security forces have been heavily criticized for being unable to quell the escalating violence along the Tana River. Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there. He said four local administrators were being fired for their lack of a response. But in a move indicating the seriousness of the situation, he said the Kenyan military could be brought in to bring security to the region. "If the situation proves more volatile, then the deployment of the army will be inevitable," Kilele said.	1
As Markus Winkelhock took to the sodden track of last week's European Grand Prix in Nuerburgring he went where one Winkelhock had been before, his father Manfred Winkelhock. Nico Rosberg (left) gets a pep talk from his world championship-winning father at this year's Monaco Grand Prix Winkelhock junior's first grand prix -- and possibly last for some time, now that Christijan Albers' vacated Spyker seat has gone to Sakon Yamamoto -- will be talked about for years to come. His decision to run on extreme wet tires on lap three saw him leading the race by 33 seconds before the race was suspended for the second time. And, although his race ended with hydraulic failure, and future drives in Formula 1 are by no means certain, he joins the rare club of drivers who have led a grand prix on their first race. It was at Nuerburgring that his father Manfred Winkelhock raced his last Formula 1 grand prix. Never a contender -- he scored only two points from 47 starts -- he was nevertheless a popular driver with the home crowd. Sadly, eleven days after the 1985 German Grand Prix at Nuerburgring, Winkelhock was killed driving a Porsche 956 at a World Sportscar event in Mosport Park, Canada. Manfred's brothers Joachim and Thomas Winkelhock were also racing drivers; Joachim entered seven grands prix in the 1989 season but did not pre-qualify, so didn't race. "My father did his last F1 race at the Nuerburgring and now I'm doing my first," said Markus last Sunday, "that is something special." Underneath his Spyker overalls, Markus wore a chain around his neck, as he always does when racing. On it was the wedding ring belonging to the father who died when Markus when only five years old -- a good luck talisman given to him by his mother. Formula 1's history has many such tales of sons following fathers into racing careers -- and in some cases the second generation drivers lost their fathers at an early age. Fatalities have been so rare in F1 in the last two decades that it's easy to forget quite how dangerous an activity it once was.	1
Four more cases of a possibly fatal respiratory virus have been confirmed in Oman and Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is a member of the coronavirus family with the potential to kill people from what appears to be a respiratory illness. (SOUNDBITE) (Arabic) MOHAMED AAMIR (PHONOGRAPHIC). "In addition, in the last two days they have confirmed three more cases of the coronavirus in Kuwait," said Dr. Margaret Harris, deputy director of the WHO regional office for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf, earlier Tuesday. The three new cases, found in the Arab Republic of Bahrain and Kuwait, are three times the number of cases in the UAE and Kuwait combined, according to Dr. Harris. She said that the Oman Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization were "following up" on the new diagnoses. Earlier this year, the U.S. and the World Health Organization announced they had discovered a virus that they call Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus — or MERS — in Saudi Arabia.

Four more cases of a possibly fatal respiratory virus have been confirmed in Oman and Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization. Three people in Eastern Saudi Arabia contracted the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and one of the patients has died, the WHO said. They ranged from 49 to 83 years old and all three had underlying medical conditions. The WHO is investigating what exposure might have caused their infections. The viral respiratory illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and since spread to at least four countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MERS unlikely to cause pandemic -- for now, experts say The WHO says it has confirmed the first case of the virus in Oman, where a 68-year-old man from Al Dahkliya region became ill October 26 and was hospitalized two days later. Since September of last year, the WHO has confirmed 149 cases of MERS-CoV and 63 people have died from the illness. No cases have been identified in the United States, according to the CDC. It's believed the virus has spread through close contact with ill people. Symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and -- in severe cases -- renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock. The WHO is asking member countries to carefully review any case of severe acute respiratory infections. Opinion: Why MERS virus is so scary	1
Four people in Japan have been killed amid heavy rain from a powerful typhoon that is expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon, authorities there said. The center of ōhoku, or the typhoon, is about 180 miles west of Tokyo.The storm hit the country's western main island about 10 miles east of Tokyo on Monday evening and then continued south over the next 36 hours, dumping torrential rains that caused flooding and landslides.In western Japan's Kansai region, the Typhoon Halong crashed into the city of Kesennuma in western Japan, causing massive damage, injuring several people and a school bus, and forcing many residents to evacuate.The typhoon that was threatening Tokyo is said to have been more powerful than Typhoon Haiyan, which killed nearly 7,800 people in the Philippines in 2013 with winds of up to 195 miles an hour."The storm is expected to become the strongest in the system, and is headed toward Tokyo," said Kimihiro Nishiyama, an official with the Meteorological Agency. "This is a serious and significant typhoon with wind and sea levels equivalent to those of a Category 5 hurricane."Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday that the government will provide an additional 6 billion yen ($55 million) in financial assistance for municipalities hit by the typhoon.But the storm is forecast to reach the capital by Thursday, putting the capital in the path of the worst typhoon to strike Japan since the 1995 Super Typhoon Halong, or Typhoon Nala, which killed about 500 people, after hitting Okinawa.The storm is also forecast to make landfall in Okinawa on May 19, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The storm would be the most powerful to hit that island since 1947, when Typhoon Talim slammed into the southernmost main island of Kyushu, causing widespread flooding, landslides and power outages.Nishiyama cautioned that it could be days before a decision is made on whether to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo to deal with the storm.Winds of up to 155 miles an hour hit Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, where residents took shelter in underground shelters and high rises as the storm swept through the city late Monday evening.Officials evacuated the city of 609,000 because of the risks of falling trees but later lifted the order.

Suspected Maoist insurgents killed nine policemen during an ambush in eastern India, authorities said Tuesday. A 10th officer is missing. The attack took place Monday in a remote area of Gariaband in Chhattisgarh state when the officers were on their way to search a house as part of anti-Maoist operation, said state police spokesman Rajesh Mishra. Their truck broke down, and they were attacked as they were waiting for a second vehicle to arrive, he said. About 10 days ago, seven officers were killed when they were ambushed as they were returning from routine patrol, Mishra said. "It's a war-like situation here," he said. The Maoist movement is considered by the government as India's greatest internal security threat. The Maoist guerrillas are called Naxalites after Naxalbari, a village in neighboring West Bengal state where they originated in the late 1960s. Officials say the Naxals aim to seize political power through what they call a protracted people's war. For their part, the insurgents have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. Over the years, they targeted Indian security forces in several impoverished eastern Indian states that have become known as the "Red Corridor." The slow-churning unrest has killed about 2,000 people.	1
Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections. A new  Nielsen study shows public support for this idea has increased since the U.S Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2013, a bill designed to protect free exercise of religion against government pressure.“When you’re talking about a federal law, you know people have reservations about it on both sides,” said Paul Taylor, managing director of the Public Religion Research Institute, which conducted the survey. “More broadly, the question really is a moral question and a cultural question.”In addition to religious objections, there are financial and legal reasons for businesses providing services to same-sex couples. More than half believe businesses should be allowed to refuse to serve the couple on the basis that their wedding is “not appropriate for the marriage-like service.” Similarly, 57 percent of Americans say businesses should be permitted to refuse to serve a same-sex couple when it is against their values.As a practical matter, when businesses get asked to comply with federal and state laws such as the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), they also may be asked by a court to issue civil marriage licenses to same-sex couples.In the new survey, Taylor and his colleagues asked a total of 2,000 Americans, including an equal number of men and women, how they felt about providing civil marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Seventy-five percent said they believed a gay couple should be able to use the civil marriage license in the same way a straight couple would, even if they objected to those services offered by the wedding venue. The percentage of Americans who were in support of that idea increased slightly after Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2013.However, less than one-third of Americans said they thought it should be legal to refuse to provide civil marriage licenses to same-sex couples on the basis of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Still, that was up from 26 percent in the question asked in 2006.“The fact that the survey was conducted within two years of congress passing that law, not having the same percentage of respondents in support of it, and having more people who disapproved of having a government mandate and a federal license law, indicates	0
Bruce Levenson couldn't cut it as a successful NBA owner. His business, the Atlanta Hawks, was failing. He needed a scapegoat, and he blamed African-Americans, his most loyal customer base. Apparently, he forgot those fans are the only group that has stuck by him in spite of the inferior product he's put on the basketball court since he took over the team 11 years ago. He should be grateful any fans showed up for the games at all. His first mistake, among many, has been forgetting that Hawks have been barely a smidgen above mediocre for as long as any sports fan can remember. Philips Arena is dull; the overpriced concession food is awful. And no matter what anyone says about "Hotlanta," football (college first and then NFL) will always be king in that city. So if you are going to invest in the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, a league that boasts the highest share of black television viewers, at 45% -- three times higher than the NFL or NCAA basketball -- and a player roster that is nearly 80% black, well, then you better have a smart business strategy to keep your core customers happy and attract corporate dollars at the same time. What we know Levenson, it seems, had no winning strategy. The "self-reporting" bigot seems to have awakened one day, looked around the City of Atlanta (which according to the 2010 census is 54% African-American and 38.4% white) and decided that all of his business failures in Atlanta had nothing to do with his own mismanagement of the team. He then sent a racist, ranting email to his business partners, outlining his personal theories about how their failing franchise might be turned around. Levenson has apologized for his tirade and said he will sell his controlling interest in the team. "I wrote an e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive," Levenson said in a Hawks news release. "I trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests (i.e., hip hop vs. country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another (i.e., that white fans might be afraid of our black fans). By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans."	1
Tom Cruise rang in the New Year smiling, as "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" led the box office with an estimated $31.3 million over the three-day (Friday to Sunday) weekend. That represents a 6 percent jump from Christmas weekend. However, nearly every wide release saw their grosses rise compared to last weekend. The weekend after Christmas has historically been a strong box-office period, as many families are still on break but are no longer occupied with holiday preparations. "Ghost Protocol," the fourth entry in the action franchise, has now cumulatively tallied $134.1 million, surpassing the final gross of "Mission: Impossible III" ($134 million). The PG-13 movie, which was helmed by Pixar animation director Brad Bird, will now attempt to catch up with the first "Mission: Impossible," which collected $181 million in 1996. That figure should be within reach for "Ghost Protocol." In second place was "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," which rose 9 percent for $22.1 million. The sequel has taken in $132.1 million in 17 days. The original "Sherlock Holmes," by comparison, had earned $165.2 million by this point. Although "A Game of Shadows" trails its predecessor, it is slowly closing the gap. This is because the first "Sherlock Holmes" opened on Christmas weekend, thereby inflating its initial figures. "Shadows," on the other hand, debuted on the (typically slow) weekend before Christmas, and is just now benefiting from a post-Christmas bump. In other words, the first "Sherlock Holmes" started out of the gate much quicker, but "Shadows" is picking up steam. The sequel probably won't have enough momentum to reach its predecessor's final tally of $209 million, but the gap between the two films should be a lot smaller than many people initially thought. The same holds true for "Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked," which jumped an incredible 45 percent for $18.3 million. The rodent threequel has so far earned $94.6 million in 17 days. In the same time frame, the 2007 original had grossed $141.4 million and its 2009 sequel had amassed $165.4 million. Despite "Chipwrecked's" slow start, it has been holding up well and should finish its domestic run with a respectable number.	1
Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on February 24, 2010, a SeaWorld Orlando trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park's killer whales. The death of Dawn Brancheau was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to Dawn -- her family, friends and colleagues at SeaWorld. I was honored to know Dawn and count myself among those SeaWorld team members deeply affected by her loss. Dawn's death has been the subject of thousands of articles, broadcast news stories, blogs, books, and now a feature film called "Blackfish." Many of these accounts trade in the details of Dawn's death in graphic detail. They do so not to inform but, rather, regrettably, because of the desire to sensationalize. Filmmaker: Why I made 'Blackfish' The three years since Dawn's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory, but rather to use the events of February 24, 2010, to advance their own interests. Some seek commercial gain. Others seek to forward a political or philosophical agenda. Still others appear to be engaged in self-promotion. But anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact: Our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care, training, shows, educational presentations, husbandry, exercise, play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years. The tragedy of Dawn's death cannot and has not been ignored, but neither should the literally millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales over that span of time. "Blackfish" focuses on a handful of incidents over our long history at the exclusion of everything else. Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld. Not one visitor who left SeaWorld more aware of the need to preserve the world around them. Not one word about the thousands of ill, orphaned and injured animals rescued by SeaWorld or the millions of dollars we dedicate to supporting conservation and research. There is no acknowledgment anywhere in the film of the great things SeaWorld does every day or the simple fact that our animals are healthy and passionately cared for. SeaWorld answers CNN's questions on orcas I started at Sea World in 1975 and have witnessed the growth and changes that come with a company that is dedicated to understanding these magnificent animals. We have collected invaluable information about these animals that could not be obtained from observation in the wild.	1
American golfer and world number six, Jim Furyk, was kicked out of the first FedEx Cup play-off on Wednesday after missing his tee-off time by oversleeping. Furyk, 40, told the official ute-driver of his problem during a phone communication, before the driver's tee time was confirmed in the event's final minutes.A golf news release on Thursday said Furyk had overslept by two minutes in the morning, and that despite his explanation, it had meant his tee-off time was not accurate. The FedEx Cup team said the club had "reviewed the situation and found that the driver's time was not accurate" and had "decided Furyk will not be playing in today's play-off".The incident has echoes of the 2011 US Open when Tiger Woods was found to have failed to report an illness, although he was only forced to withdraw from the match.The case is a reminder of how difficult it can be to check all the boxes when it comes to playing a golf club.It is not the first time this year that a USGA golf official has been disciplined for over-sleeping, and Furyk was accused of failing to report his driver's time to the tour by an official from Augusta National.That case was also dismissed by the USGA after the official confirmed the time that was originally sent.Tiger Woods withdrew from the final round of the US Open amid accusations he had failed to report a potential illness.The case was dismissed at a hearing in Boston in July.Furyk said he had overslept by two minutes in January and sent a text message to his wife from the official's mobile phone.The official said Furyk "had asked for a different number to be assigned to his phone but was not given it", leading Furyk to believe he was entitled because the tee times were published before he had played the match on the morning of the scheduled start."I was not given a new phone number, so in my opinion I missed the last phone call with the caddie that morning," Furyk said."Because of that I felt like I was trying to get the wrong number to play the golf course, so I decided to not play the golf match."The case is an illustration of how the rules around the sport can be misinterpreted.The USGA	0
Syrian opposition leaders have dubbed Friday's planned demonstrations "Friday of Saleh al-Ali," a prominent Alawite who commanded one of the first rebellions against the French mandate of Syria in the early part of the 20th century. Some opposition activists said they hope the name prompts the powerful minority ruling class, which is composed primarily of Alawites, to join the demonstrations demanding the fall of the regime. They also say the name sends the message that their demands are not directed against Alawites, but against the regime. Government opponents accuse the regime of identifying them as an Islamist movement, which they deny. The plans came as Syrian refugees continued Thursday to flee across the Turkish border to escape violence, as world powers amplified their outrage over the Damascus regime's tough crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey stands at 8,904, Turkish emergency officials said. Their report comes a day after Turkish government officials, including Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, met with a special Syrian envoy to help stem the growing tide of refugees. Violence in the country and an offensive in and around the town of Jisr al-Shugur spurred thousands of people to make their way to the border region, and Turkish officials are worried that the crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the area. Davutoglu met Thursday with Syrian envoy Hasan Turkmani, who also sat down on Wednesday with Erdogan. The foreign minister briefed the news media in Ankara about the border crisis, the Turkish meeting with the Syrian envoy, and his visit with Syrian refugees on Wednesday in the Turkish city of Hatay. "It was a meeting that was very comprehensive in which everything was openly discussed, based on mutual confidence and a joint understanding of sharing matters," Davutoglu said of the meeting with Turkmani and his delegation. Calling for a "strong, stable and prosperous Syria," Davutoglu urged the timely development of a "comprehensive reform process" there and an end to the discord in Syria. "I hope the positive scenario of introducing reforms and eliminating violence will take place," he said. "I don't even want to think about the other scenario." He said Turkey will provide humanitarian help to Syrians massed on the Syrian side of the border. Many Syrians who have fled their homes haven't crossed into Turkey and have instead lived near the border in grim conditions.	1
From bedroom creators to big studios, hand-drawn to CGI, animation has charmed and entertained children -- and, increasingly, adults -- for many years. The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to vernacularize animation, and this guide explores what makes it special.I met with many people at Cannes Lions after they had watched the opening night film, Finding Neverland, with its sweet, sentimental story of a father's love for his son and a mother's love for her daughter. The mother finds her son, after the father dies, floating in the Caribbean by himself. He turns out to be a mermaid, who has been living with a human woman, a local, for decades. (It's a heartwrenching tale, and well acted, which is surprising considering that the movie was actually made by Peter Jackson.) The French have a word for it: "le féminin."But that's not the only thing that struck me during my day of sessions with animated screenwriters and directors I'd met at the International Animation Workshop. First, and probably most important, they all had great stories to tell about animation.The first thing I heard time and again from the people I met -- people whose work I'd previously only heard about or read about in books, like Michael Sporn, the late animator who worked on Wallace & Gromit, and who died tragically at age 35, when he was struck in a trainyard, in 1995. For the last eight years, Sporn had been the head of the Art Department at London's Film School, and the only person I'd met at Cannes on the day of the workshop who, despite having had very little exposure to animation in his life, was able to tell me about how moving it was to watch Sporn do his films. (I heard he was the person who encouraged Paul Dini to go into animation: "I can see him working over the back of the sofa," Dini said. But then, Dini has spent much of his life working in advertising, so I'd been told.)The next person I met, who told me his story, was the late John Lasseter. I'd only met him a few times, in passing, but I came to know him as a director and animator who'd done some of the best work of his career with Pixar. Lasseter and his former Pixar colleague, John	0
If there's one thing we've learned about the CNN iReport community, it's that you all love to capture celestial events. Thursday's partial solar eclipse was no exception. The eclipse reached its height at 5:45 p.m. ET, NASA said, meaning the eastern half of the country should have gotten a view before the backdrop of golden twilight hues. People living in the Central Time Zone had the best view. As the moon clipped the sun, it appeared like a fingernail. Or, according to iReporter and independent journalist Georgianne Nienaber, like an iconic arcade game character. "The moon took a little chunk out of the sun, like Pac-Man," she said. Neinaber spent her evening in Sanibel Island, Florida, getting the perfect shot of the eclipse. Of course, staring at the sun is never a good idea, even during an eclipse. "Don't stare," NASA urged. "Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the Moon can still cause pain and eye damage. Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter." Greg Hogan of Kathleen, Georgia, attached his camera to a telescope with a solar filter in order to photograph the show. Hogan, who usually photographs the moon, started experimenting with sun photography this week. The effort was worth it, he said. "It was epic!" The above photos were snapped by iReporters across the country, all with the aid of filters or other creative methods of viewing the eclipse indirectly. Check out the gallery and share your own eclipse photos here.	1
Nothing says you've made it in life or business quite like the glamor of a yacht or private jet. These extravagant toys of the rich and famous are perhaps the ultimate in status symbols, good for business and a comforting boost to the ego of their wealthy proprietors. The only problem is attaining one of these stylish items has traditionally required a shed-load of cash preceded by a healthy dose of success -- but that isn't necessarily the case anymore. An increasing number of people are pooling their resources to buy up and then share grandiose luxury products like yachts and private jets through fractional ownership initiatives. "It's great to bring clients and business contacts on the boat because the boat is a place more small ... more intimate," yacht owner Dino Ballestra told CNN. Ballestra previously owned his vessel outright but recently sold off a 75% stake to other investors, keeping the remaining 25% for himself. "Because the costs of running a boat are very high I'm looking to share the pleasure of the boat with a group," he explained. See also: Are piloteless jets within reach Fractional ownership models like those employed by Ballestra work upon the basic principle that things you don't use all the time are worth splitting costs over. The concept was first introduced to the field of luxury travel in the 1980's by forward-thinking firms such as Netjets, who brought together buyers to purchase private jets using a time-share-like model. Today, internet savvy companies such as Flyvictor have constructed their own market-based version of the fractional ownership model. "We're helping the industry to become more efficient by allowing owners to charter their aircraft through the victor platform and allowing people who want to charter a jet -- not own a jet -- and take all the benefits of flying private to and from destinations," explained Flyvictor founder, Clive Jackson. Flyvictor's website acts as a forum where owners or co-owners can advertise their jets for charter or hire. Those looking to fly solo or band together with fellow travelers meanwhile can browse to see what's on offer. Customers are never guaranteed to get exactly what they are after but if they're lucky they may be able to pick up a bargain.	1
No veteran should be forgotten, President Barack Obama said Saturday while commemorating the end 60 years ago of the Korean conflict, sometimes described as the "forgotten war." He laid a wreath at the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall and spoke to veterans and family members with ties to both U.S. and Korean troops, an audience estimated by event organizers to number 5,000. Active hostilities on the Korean conflict halted six decades ago with the signing of an armistice agreement, leaving the war between the North and South in suspension, and the peninsula divided by a demilitarized zone where tensions remain tense to this day. More than 36,000 U.S. troops died and 103,000 were wounded in the three-year conflict. Fast facts: Korean War The military says just over 7,900 U.S. troops remain missing, and Obama expressed a commitment to "give these families a full accounting of their loved ones." For example, the family of Sgt. 1st Class William Robinson, who went missing at 26 in 1950, will bury his remains in Pennsylvania this week, he said. He noted that returning veterans were not welcomed by parades or protests and said these veterans, as do all, "deserved better." Pondering Pyongyang: Beijing's problem child "Here in America, no war should ever be forgotten, and no veteran should ever be overlooked," Obama said, pronouncing the war a definitive win. "Korea was a victory," he said, because South Koreans live "in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North." North Korea, meanwhile, observed what they called "Victory Day" on Saturday in the capital city Pyongyang with a lengthy military parade that was reviewed by leader Kim Jong Un and the Chinese vice president, Li Yuanchao. Cosmetic change, but no real reform, in North Korea Obama's remarks come as the U.S. military draws down from over a decade of war in Afghanistan. He said the nation should "make it our mission to give (veterans) the respect and the care and the opportunities that they have earned." His wife, first lady Michelle Obama, has led an initiative for veterans and military families called Joining Forces. Talking peace with a backdrop of war	1
The final results from Ukraine's presidential election on Wednesday showed former Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich winning a close race, but an official declaration of a victor was still to come. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has refused to concede and called her election as president "a sham," saying it had "been stolen." Yanukovich, she added, could not win.Ukraine's national election commission said late Wednesday it would declare Yanukovich the winner by a margin of just about 200,000 votes (plus 100,000 ballots invalidated by police and the election commission). But the commission said there were "sufficient grounds" for further study in the case of tens of thousands of absentee ballots that were never counted.At a press conference late Wednesday night at the presidential headquarters, Tymoshenko said the election had been a "sham" and that the commission's election report would be "a lie.""Today, we do not have the mandate to declare the winner," she said. "I have been trying for three days to get it accepted and I have been going to the president and the Central Election Commission, but I have been told that they do not have the mandate. We need some days to decide in order to have a clear picture. Today, we have only two possibilities: (A) that the president of Ukraine wants to see the report, or (B) that the report is prepared by someone who is trying to make Yanukovych the winner."The BBC's Robert Mackey says the report is expected to come out in the next few days and, while it could be presented in a way that gives the impression that one candidate is a sure winner, it will also be presented as a study of the situation, not a definitive and conclusive result.The European Union, the United States and the European Parliament have issued strong statements calling for respect of the will of the people and the vote of the people. The UN has also called for a "free, fair and transparent election."Tymoshenko said at the press conference that she had been trying to convince the Ukrainian parliament to accept the results of the election, but it refused, saying it was not up to the parliament to recognize the results."When our election commission is ready to declare the results, we will be able to give a response," she told journalists.A few hours later, Yanukovich said on his private television station that the election commission	0
How many Ferraris does it take to impress a hotel valet in Boca? More than 25, apparently. The guy driving us around the opulent Boca Raton Resort and Club in his hotel-issued golf cart was non-plussed by the abundant wealth on display in the driveways and parking lots around the property. How many Ferraris were here? "Twenty to twenty-five," he said, shrugging.  How many BMWs? "Too many to count." This is Palm Beach County, of course, where money ain't a thing. But there was even more money here this week: The resort was playing host to the the Republican Governors Association's annual meeting, always a magnet for major GOP donors, corporate fixers and political consultants looking to get some some face time, and maybe a contract or two, with the 31 Republican governors and governors-elect who now control state houses around the country. "It's a target-rich environment," said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. "Governors are able to talk to businesses from around the country that are looking to re-locate and looking to expand ... I've gotten a few scalps here." Perry joined a half dozen other potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich and Mike Pence. They were all more than happy to soak up attention from admirers and make nice with potential contributors. "If you are an individual who is running for office, this is a good place to be to meet people who have a lot really good ideas about how to to do public policy, and meet men and women who want to see good government put into place," Perry said. "And it's up to the point of, 'Well, I'm gonna loan you not only my name, but lend you some money as well. I'm gonna contribute to your campaign.' And that's all good. That's how this process works." All of this means that money is in the air at events like the one in Boca, which are as much about donor maintenance and business meetings as they are about electing governors. When their donors are involved, the RGA likes to roll out the red carpet, holding their conferences at high-end resorts like this one: Past RGA meetings were held in Scottsdale, Aspen and Austin. Ferraris abound.	1
The captain of a Greenpeace icebreaker carrying 30 activists protesting Arctic drilling has declined a demand made at gunpoint by Russian authorities to sail it toward the Russian port city of Murmansk, a Greenpeace spokeswoman said ikezak.ru, an online version of Russia's state television network RIAAccording to Greenpeace, its captain refused the demand saying he was unwilling to sail into Russian territorial waters. He also said the ice breaker would stay at anchor in international waters, the organization's Ria news agency reported.According to Greenpeace, the captain of the vessel refused to sail into Russia until he received orders from Russia to stop. Russia’s Federal Security Service is investigating the incident.The spokeswoman added that the ice breaker was forced to stop in the Arctic because the captain of another ship, carrying Greenpeace officials and several activists, refused to follow orders to proceed.The action comes after Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced he was ordering Arctic drilling to stop within nine months unless the environmental group did so as well.In July, Putin said the country should leave a "free and transparent Arctic.""Russia has long been a supporter of the environment, but now it is time to act. The Arctic will lose its unique features as it becomes a dumping ground for hazardous substances. The Arctic is the last unspoiled area of the planet. We must do everything we can to protect it," Putin said.Greenpeace says there's ample evidence of drilling activity and pollution in the Arctic."Russia is doing dangerous and reckless things in the Arctic. We are watching it, but it is time for other countries to step up and help protect this incredibly fragile environment," Peter Gleick, a geochemist and Greenpeace's senior scientist, said in a statement.The group has called for a ban on Arctic drilling. Russia says Arctic drilling is essential to its energy needs and to protect its northern economy.In 2009, Russia established the Arctic LNG terminal to import liquefied natural gas from Canada.The agency said earlier this week it was examining the report published by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the effects of climate change. Greenpeace spokeswoman Katie Townsend said "this report is deeply worrying," according to the Associated Press.The IPCC is expected to present its report on Saturday.It will include a summary of its findings and a preliminary assessment of possible responses, including	0
The fragile relationship between China and Japan came under fresh strain Tuesday as ships from both sides crowded into the waters around a disputed group of islands and nearly 170 Japanese lawmakers visited a controversial war memorial. The Japanese Coast Guard said eight Chinese government ships had entered waters near the contested islands in the East China Sea on Tuesday morning, the largest number to do so at any one time since tensions surrounding the territorial dispute escalated last year. China said its ships were there to monitor the movements of Japanese vessels in the area after a Japanese nationalist group chartered a flotilla of fishing boats to take dozens of activists there. The Japanese foreign ministry responded by summoning the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo to lodge a strong protest about the Chinese ships' presence near the uninhabited islands that lie between Okinawa and Taiwan and are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. The Chinese ambassador, Cheng Yonghua, retorted that it was the Japanese vessels that were intruding in Chinese territory. Will radar-rattling turn to conflict? A day earlier, Beijing had protested to Tokyo about a visit at the weekend by three Japanese cabinet ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japanese people killed while fighting for their country, including convicted war criminals. Countries that suffered heavily at the hands of the Japanese military before and during World War II, such as China and South Korea, consider the shrine as an emblem of that aggressive period in Japanese history. But China's representations failed to deter 168 Japanese members of parliament from visiting the shrine on Tuesday to pay their respects to the war dead, the most to do so in recent years. How a remote rock split China and Japan New men in charge New leaders have taken office in both countries in the past few months: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan and President Xi Jinping in China. They inherited a highly delicate situation concerning the disputed islands that analysts have warned could spiral out of control -- a concern for the United States, which has a mutual security treaty with Japan. "Despite expressions by both governments that they wish to avoid a war, potential for escalation has increased and there is deepening pessimism on both sides over the prospects of a peaceful settlement," the International Crisis Group said in a report this month on the tensions between Japan and China. "Tokyo and Beijing urgently need to work toward establishing communication mechanisms and strengthening crisis mitigation in order to avoid a larger conflict," the report said.	1
Ronaldinho scored twice as Barcelona wrapped up their Scottish pre-season tour with a convincing 3-1 win over Hearts before a record 57,857 home crowd on Saturday. Two-goal Ronaldinho played a key part in Barcelona's convincing 3-1 win. The Brazilian put Barca ahead with a 21st-minute penalty and restored their lead with a 40th-minute header after Finn Juho Makela had stabbed in a quick equalizer from Christophe Berra's header across goal. Second-half substitute Thierry Henry, who scored in Barcelona's 1-0 win over Dundee United on Thursday, set up the third six minutes after the interval for Mexican teenager Giovanni Dos Santos. The Frenchman ended a fine run by squaring a pass to the 18-year-old who slotted home from close range. The friendly was played at Murrayfield, home of the Scotland rugby union team, to accommodate a bigger crowd. The previous record for a Hearts home match was 53,396 for a Scottish FA Cup match against Rangers in 1932. Arsenal were 2-1 winners over Paris St Germain and Valencia beat Inter Milan 2-0 on the first day of the pre-season Emirates Cup tournament. Both games were played at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium where the friendly tournament ends on Sunday with Arsenal playing Inter and Valencia facing PSG. Valencia recorded a comfortable win over the Italian champions. Jaime Gavilan opened the scoring, collecting a long ball forward and beating Inter keeper Francesco Toldo from a tight angle. Striker David Villa made it 2-0 before the break with a deflected free kick. Arsenal's French midfielder Mathieu Flamini put the hosts ahead on the stroke of half-time in the day's second game, with his first-time shot flashing in off the post. Danish forward Nicklas Bendtner poked home their second in a goalmouth melee in the 70th minute and Peguy Luyindula scored PSG's consolation goal 10 minutes from time before Bendtner missed a late penalty. Rangers beat Chelsea 2-0 with both goals coming in the last four minutes of their pre-season friendly at Ibrox. Spanish substitute striker Nacho Novo fired home the opening goal with a 20-meter shot, after taking a neat pass from Chris Burke in the 86th minute.	1
The Deep South will be plunged into a deep freeze again this week, this time with ice and snow expected to fall all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters issued a winter storm warning for New Orleans and its suburbs Â the rest of the state, and along the Gulf Coast, where the mercury is expected to hit the mid-30s. The good news is that the rainstorms will pass, but by then, the state will be bone-dry for the rest of the week. Here are some weather-related stories you need to know.How will the storm affect traffic?No, we are not talking about traffic on I-10, or north or southbound I-10 on the way home from work or to school. We are talking about traffic in downtown New Orleans during the week of Jan. 5-9. The city is planning to shut down two key streets to discourage drivers from taking the detour route out of town: Interstate 10 and U.S. 90.The roads will be closed starting at 7 a.m. Friday, Jan. 4, and will remain closed through the weekend, weather permitting. U.S. 90 will be closed west of Canal St. west of Marconi St. and will be closed east of Marconi St. The closures will be in place until 1 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 7. Eastbound I-10 will close from Louisiana to St. Bernard St., and from St. Bernard St. to I-10, as the storm approaches.All other access points to and from New Orleans will close, and traffic restrictions will be in effect when the city closes off I-10 and U.S. 90.I-10 on eastbound and northbound lanes will continue to be open west of Canal St. for eastbound traffic only, weather permitting.This is exactly the kind of emergency action that can be seen as a symptom of a much deeper problem: the increasing congestion, pollution and traffic congestion that are a legacy of a dysfunctional, largely unregulated, corporate-based transportation system. I-10 on the way home from work, or to school, or simply a trip to the grocery store or pharmacy. That is New Orleans' reality, and it's all too often one commuters face every day.Here are some highlights from the story:• New Orleans has the worst traffic congestion	0
Syria's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now, resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people, according to estimates from the office of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner. More than 500,000 Syrians have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and the U.N. believes that number could top a million in the coming year. Will the situation improve in 2013, or will the bloody stalemate continue? There have been encouraging signs lately for the opposition, which has made military gains against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But some observers say al-Assad's grip on power remains strong. CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold. Will the rebels defeat the regime? Nick Paton Walsh: I think there's very little doubt that will happen. It's not going to be one day in which there's a decisive changing of the flags over a building in Damascus and then the whole country turns 180 degrees in terms of its government. But there have been weeks now of consistent bad news for the regime. ... That affects not only how people feel inside the regime's inner circle, it affects how their sponsors feel. And, of course, it boosts morale for the rebels as well. So that real sense of momentum has been in place for months. It's beginning to nip around the capital, and I don't think any observer at this point thinks that the Assad government really has a chance in terms of retaining long-term power over the country. Will al-Assad stay and fight until the end as he has said? Or will he go? Nic Robertson: The rebels have said that they won't rest until Assad is completely gone; they won't negotiate with them. But he's showing no signs of leaving whatsoever. Perhaps there are early indications that Assad does realize that he cannot hold on to complete power as he has in the past. So perhaps what we're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where, rather than fight to hold on to everything, they're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future.	1

With money a bit tight these days, many people searching for jobs would like a Â job matching a job they already have. If they already have a job matching, they could contact CareerBuilder.com directly instead of using CNN.com.(CNN) -- With President Obama's tax reform plan now on shaky ground and the White House being criticized by Republicans for its failure to produce jobs, a new question is emerging: Will Americans who hold two or more jobs hold on to them?It's not an entirely irrational question, but few would argue that it's one that's not yet been asked."We do this as a government of, by and for the American people," said White House Director of Economic Policy Sylvia Burwell during a briefing Monday. "We're in a position where we can do anything we want to."In addition to helping the working poor, President Obama's plan seeks to reduce revenue for the rich by increasing taxes, and help the middle class grow by lowering tax rates."Most of the people who are working right now are not taking all the money they earn and putting it into the economy," Burwell said.As the President outlined his proposed tax reform in his address to a joint session of Congress last week, economists estimate that as many as 15 million jobs could be created over the next decade from the proposals, and the White House has said it would "actively seek" to do that.But the question of whether Americans who hold two or more jobs will hold on to them remains up for debate.In a study published last week, a team of economists said that as the economy continues to recover after the recession of the late 2000s, more than one in five jobs will be lost in the decade ahead, and two in five jobs will be lost for the next two decades.The study, released by the Brookings Institution, found that three out of four jobs that could be lost in the next decade were held by women and that the bulk of those jobs would be held by workers aged 50 and older.But the economists concluded that for workers who had their first jobs in the 1990s, "the odds of holding onto a second job are about the same as winning the lottery for someone who doesn	0
Despite the departure of star Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, the "Bourne" franchise still ruled the box office this weekend. "The Bourne Legacy," Universal's $125 million sequel/reboot, which stars Jeremy Renner as a new (but similarly brainwashed) secret agent, topped the chart with an estimated $40.3 million from 3,745 locations. The action film debuted higher than franchise launchpad "The Bourne Identity," which grossed $27.1 million in its 2002 opening weekend, but it will need solid word of mouth (which may not be merited by its lukewarm "B" CinemaScore grade) to match that film's $121.7 million finish. "Legacy" was unable to reach the heights of its two predecessors, though. "The Bourne Supremacy" started with $52.5 million on the way to $176.2 million, and 2007′s "The Bourne Ultimatum" started with $69.3 million en route to a $227.5 million finish. The past year has been a great one for Jeremy Renner, who nabbed roles in back-to-back blockbusters "Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol" and "The Avengers," and while the opening of "Legacy" is another solid notch on his belt, it still doesn't prove definitively that he is a real box office draw. The original "Bourne" trilogy earned the franchise a tremendous amount of goodwill from audiences, and it's that franchise trust that likely benefited "Legacy" (and "Mission," and "Avengers") more than Renner's presence. Whether the formidable actor can pull in audiences on his own remains to be seen. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis' election comedy "The Campaign" took second place with $27.4 million. The R-rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as Ferrell's last live-action wide release "The Other Guys" ($35.5 million), and Galifianakis' last non-"Hangover" comedy "Due Date" ($32.7 million). While "The Campaign's" grosses are a bit lower than those movies (and recent R-rated hit "21 Jump Street," which opened with $36.1 million), the debut frame is remarkably impressive considering the subject matter.	1
Whip It!" suggests what might have happened if Juno had gone to a high school as poky as Napoleon Dynamite's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a ____ she just needed some extra push to get there.In "A Few Kind Words for the New Kids," the narrator of the song lives in the suburbs until she gets home one day and finds her house stripped bare of all her furniture and decorations. But what really sends her into panic mode is that the house next door has new furniture installed the previous year, in the shape of a jukebox."We need your help," a child's voice says, when a boy named Johnny appears and gives her a stack of dollar bills. "Take that to your mother. She will need it." And that's when the song says it all, in that it doesn't matter if the kid's mother is old or young, rich or poor, male or female, black or white, as long as she has a few kind words to say.I think it's really powerful. It's a perfect example of not trying to make everything more dramatic, but instead, make it as easy for the audience to see that all the bad things in the world are still happening to everyone. The song's message is that bad things can, and probably will, happen no matter what you do, so why not embrace it. Let the "problem" be the song itself. And it's especially powerful because the problem is that when it comes to the people who seem to be on the other side of so many problems, there is no way things could be worse."Dedicated to The People's Front," written by the Beach Boys, originally appeared on the album _Pet Sounds._ Here, the narrator is a teenager who is living at home until her father remarries. Then, she tries to find a job waiting tables at the local diner after school. As the song proceeds, her friends start asking other girls to go out—and then they find out they can't find anyone to go with them. In a twist of fate, the girl she takes to the diner is the daughter of her father's second wife."Dedicated to The People's Front" is a heart-wrenching song, but it also has a hopeful message, one that is echoed in a number of other records the Beach Boys made during this time.

A killer who sent a prosecutor a taunting letter about  killing a 16-year-old girl died in Virginia's electric chair Thursday night, the Richmond Times Dispatch reported. Paul Warner Powell was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. ET, the newspaper reported. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell had denied clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court in January refused to block the execution. Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home. Powell claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing. The high court in July delayed Powell's execution while considering the broader constitutional claims, which were finally rejected. The killer rejected lethal injection, the state's usual method of execution. "I'm hopeful this is the last legal chapter in the long history of this case," said Powell's prosecutor, Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert. "The survivors -- Stacie's mother and [her sister] -- have really been traumatized by delay after delay. Hopefully they're going to get some peace and closure after all these years." CNN does not identify sexual assault victims without their permission, even though the surviving victim, now 25, has talked publicly about the case. The crime shocked the Washington area. Stacie Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist. The state's highest court eventually threw out the 2000 verdict in the first trial, saying prosecutors had not proven other necessary death-eligible offenses were committed against the 16-year-old. Such "aggravating" factors could include, rape, attempted rape or robbery in commission of the murder. The sexual assault and attempted murder of Stacie's younger sister was upheld, and Powell was given a long prison sentence. Powell, believing he was free from execution, proceeded to write a taunting, profanity-filled letter from behind bars to Ebert, laying out explicit details of the crime unknown to investigators at the time. "Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are," wrote Powell, who is white.	1
An $8.5 million stimulus spending project to rebuild a little-used Montana border station is on hold because the station could become an outpost on a one-way street. Canada has decided to shut down its side of the Whitetail, Montana, border crossing next year because fewer than five vehicles a day use the crossing. The decision comes at the same time the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is planning to spend spend the millions in stimulus funds to upgrade the border station. The upgrade is part of a highly criticized decision last year that sent tens of millions of dollars in stimulus funds to revamp or rebuild border stations across Montana's northern border with Canada. The crossing at Whitetail is the least used. Canada estimates five vehicles a day cross the border there. Vehicles crossing into the United States average as few as two a day at Whitehall, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records. The Department of Homeland Security has stressed the need for spending tens of millions of dollars in Montana to improve security along the border. But in light of Canada's decision, Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rafael Lemaitre says the government "is pausing construction at the Whitetail Port of Entry until September 1 in order to work with the Canada Border Services Agency to develop a joint solution that ensures the continued security interests of both countries." The recent announcement by Canadian officials to close the station on their side of the border has brought sharp criticism about the stimulus spending plan from Montana's lone congressman. Rep. Denny Rehberg, a Republican, released a statement saying, "Montanans aren't happy about how their tax dollars are being wasted." Rehberg has asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to once again review the plan to spend $8.5 million dollars on the border crossing, adding that its his job as a congressman to "safeguard tax dollars, and I'm making sure this boondoggle doesn't slip through the cracks." Even Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who last year was one of the biggest supporters of the plan to spend millions on Montana's border crossings, is now backtracking. Tester told CNN in August of 2009 that the spending would "pay off for generations to come by creating new jobs and opportunity that would benefit all of Montana." A spokeswoman for Tester says the senator now is asking for construction to cease until another review can be conducted.	1
A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said. The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said. All three aircraft -- CV-22 Ospreys -- were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement. The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said. Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was "reviewing options," Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. "Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department," he added. The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter. The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month's violence. Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry's second call to Kiir since Thursday night. "Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.	1
Those little yellow minions can't be stopped! "Despicable Me 2" easily won the box office race on Wednesday with $34.3 million ($4.7 million of which came from Tuesday night showings beginning at 7 p.m.), putting it on pace for a remarkable $140 million five-day debut. The $76 million film, produced by Illumination Entertainment and distributed by Universal, will easily notch one of the best opening weekends of 2013. And with an enthusiastic "A-" CinemaScore, the film is on track to quickly surpass "The Croods" and Monsters University to become the biggest animated hit of 2013. Disney's ultra-expensive western "The Lone Ranger" stumbled out of the gate on Wednesday, wrangling a terrible $9.7 million, which puts it on pace for a five-day debut in the $45-50 million range. The film, which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, cost at least $225 million to produce and could cause a major financial blow to the studio since westerns rarely play well outside of the United States. EW: On the scene at 'The Lone Ranger' premiere The weekend's other new opener, comedy film "Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain," pulverized already heightened expectations with an impressive $4.8 million from only 876 theaters. The film, a follow-up to Hart's $7.7 million-earner Kevin Hart: Laugh at My Pain, could earn about $18 million in its five-day start — a fantastic result for a film that cost just $2.5 million to produce. Due to the July 4th holiday, there has been some delay in reporting studio grosses this morning, but check back to EW throughout the holiday weekend for more box office updates — including holdovers from last week — and have a happy Independence Day!

Silent, almost shy as she headed into Manhattan Criminal Court, Ailina Tsarnaeva was anything but timid when it came to a perceived rival, prosecutors say. According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying "Leave my man alone." "Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live," she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn't consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev's lawyers don't dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother's head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive.	1
A Republican member of Congress in charge of investigating the Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed said Monday that questions remain about what happened that night but he does not think the Obama administration formulated a "complete cover-up." Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Georgia, chair of a House Intelligence subcommittee, said incompetence is the likely culprit. "I don't think they knew what they were doing," he said. He said the various arms of government involved -- the State Department and intelligence agencies -- "got their communications mixed up." "I think what ended up happening, you had the State Department trying to tell one story and you had the security, the intelligence community that may have been trying to sell another story," Westmoreland said on CNN's "New Day." Westmoreland's subcommittee interviewed five CIA contractors who were at the compound that night. More than a year after the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, questions still linger as to what led to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The House Intelligence Committee has held 15 hearings on the attacks. Benghazi Consulate Attack Fast Facts In the days following the September 11, 2012, attacks, the Obama administration said the incident was not a planned attack but was a protest turned violent. That story quickly unraveled and the administration has been accused of a cover-up. "I don't think there was any doubt that they knew it was a coordinated attack," Westmoreland said, pointing to the "accuracy of the mortar fire that came." More questions about a cover-up arose recently when members of Congress found out that Americans present that night were asked to sign an updated nondisclosure agreement. CNN investigative correspondent Drew Griffin reported last week that a source told him that "there is not a person in Washington, D.C., who doesn't understand why the forms were put in front of these people." Congressional source: Benghazi contractors seem to contradict CIA chief Westmoreland said it's "not that unusual" to sign updated security agreements and that the forms specifically stated that signatories have the right to speak to House and Senate Intelligence committees. Westmoreland also said that reports of "an ongoing gun battle" throughout the night are "just not true." He said the CIA operatives told his subcommittee there was random fire throughout the night, which was commonplace in Benghazi. He said questions do remain, however, including if there was a lull in activity between the sparse gunfire.	1
A best picture nomination is not exactly nothing. Many would argue that it's just about everything. Yet there was brush-fire-level rage on and off the Internet -- see #OscarsSoWhite -- following Thursday Ã¢ÂÂ yes, Thursday Ã¢ÂÂ when director Ava DuVernay was denied a nomination for directing Ã¢ÂÂ for best picture at the 86th Academy Awards. Her film, the story of a young girl's battle with post-traumatic stress disorder, had only been nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes. As many of you know, DuVernay's film was the top choice for best picture.So here we are with the Emmys Ã¢ÂÂ and now we're thinking, which film deserved to win, and which didn't. (Spoiler: it was the Best Picture winner.)It's important that we speak the truth.There is no truth in the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. There was never any truth in it.All of the debate we have seen in this time around the Emmy Awards is a result of a conversation that we've been having for a long time. We are saying, "Well, the truth is, none of us really know what's going on."We do know that there wasn't an "Oscars So White" film. And from this day forward, that's it. There won't be another one.We are talking about that. You are talking about it.No matter what Ava DuVernay and her people say, they haven't explained what they meant when they said that they had "inclusive, all-inclusive" plans for the films in the category.You've heard enough of them saying it. You know that their only plan was to include both an all-black and an all-white film in the category. You know that that is the only plan they had in mind.It's not enough to just say, "Well, we didn't realize she was in it. So we didn't realize she was in it. Maybe she didn't know anything about it. Maybe she never got involved in the category at all."They had a plan. It wasn't inclusive at all. It made no sense.	0
Condolences continued to pour in late Sunday night following the death of heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio, who lost his battle with stomach cancer earlier in the day. "Today my heart is broken, Ronnie passed  away peacefully in his sleep," the singer's publicist Steve Kornacki tweeted. "The music he made for so many will live on. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family." "Rest in peace Ronnie J Dio, we will miss you and love you forever," added Dio's family and close friend, Joe Barbucci.I've never known a man who was as full of life, full of fun and full of love as Ronnie. He loved his job, I knew when I first met him that he was a real professional.I have the utmost respect for Ronnie James Dio. He was a man of genuine kindness and class at all times; the kind of person that you could share a drink with, smile at, and chat with. Ronnie James Dio was always so gracious and always had a smile on his face. He was kind to everyone he met and made everyone feel special and cared for. He was a true friend and a gentleman and I'm proud to have known him. RIP Ronnie J. DioThe world's greatest Rock star died just two months before the release of his first album in 15 years, a fitting tribute to a man who epitomized the style and artistry of hard rock in the 70s and 80s.Dio had been battling Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes problems controlling bowel movement, since September 2012. He had undergone treatment in the past for Crohn’s disease and underwent another procedure at the beginning of this year, but he apparently did not get the diagnosis until just before he passed.He was scheduled to perform on Saturday night in Detroit, but he was too ill to finish a show. Those who could make it to Dio’s funeral in New Jersey told the Associated Press that his body was slumped forward as he lay in bed while watching television and was unable to talk or perform. Many expressed sympathy on Twitter for Dio’s family, but his closest friends have expressed disbelief that it took them so long to learn of his illness."I didn't know he [Dio] had Crohn's," Dio’s longtime friend Joe Barbucci told	0

A pharmacist testified that he warned Anna Nicole Smith's doctors and boyfriend that a list of medications intended for Smith a week after her son's death could be "pharmaceutical suicide." Anna Nicole Smith, with Howard  Smith's knowledge, then made a list of other medications and a schedule of doses. This was in violation of the regulations under which Smith was operating as a drug company employee. Although Howard Smith attempted to prevent Anna Nicole Smith from making the list, he helped her to do so and then attempted to prevent her from withdrawing it. As Smith left the hospital with her son's remains, Howard Smith walked with her, and Smith told him he had "one of those" last conversations with her son before he died. Howard Smith agreed Smith would go to trial.15Smith had been in an intimate relationship with her boyfriend, Larry Smith, for some time. Larry Smith testified that before the trial started he had heard rumors about Anna Nicole Smith's death, that it had been drug related, and that Howard Smith was being tried for murder. Smith was frightened when Smith told her they were going to trial, and testified that she felt "very guilty about [Howard Smith] just holding her back from going through this trial."16Smith also testified at trial that about two or three days after the trial began, Howard Smith said that if Smith had testified at trial that she had done nothing wrong, the jury would have believed Smith that "they had been threatened or there were threats made." Smith did not testify at the trial, nor did she offer any other version of events. The jury convicted Howard Smith of murder in the first degree. This was based on the fact that Smith had helped Anna Nicole Smith prepare the list of medications  and the fact that Smith was found guilt by a jury. Howard Smith was thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment.17Howard Smith appealed to this court, arguing that he was denied his right to due process of law when he was unable to call his sister, his sister's son, and his brother to testify that he was in Mexico or in a different country, when the indictment alleged he was in the Middle East. He also argues that the jury was biased and the judge erred when she granted the government's motion to dismiss the count of the indictment alleging Howard Smith committed murder in the course of a felony. This court affirmed the judgment, United States v. Smith,  No. 93-5546, 1995 WL	0
Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country's rural heartland. The controversy over ฿2 billion (US $26m) of rice subsidies in the 2009-2010 fiscal year has been a political nightmare for the government, with dozens of officials accused of corruption linked to the rice scheme and facing criminal charges. The rice subsidy scheme is administered by the Thai government, but a number of agencies, including the Ministry of Agriculture, also help administer the government's other rice subsidies and are accused of making money out of the scheme, as well. A series of exposés, including the New York Times and The Times of India, have highlighted alleged kickbacks in the rice scheme.The scheme has triggered allegations of kickbacks, corruption and abuse of power, all of which have angered farmers, many of whom are being asked to forgive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in 2007.Shinawatra, who has become the first female prime minister in Thailand's history, has denied all the accusations against her, calling them 'false and groundless' and threatening to sue the Times. Shinawatra has asked the Supreme Court not to investigate or prosecute those accused as the allegations have been made by 'a small handful individuals who have no information about other people and who are being investigated by courts'. She has not yet asked the court to rule on an anti-graft commission.Thailand's prime minister has said she is not a suspect in the allegations, even though she has not been officially asked to resign as prime minister. But there are reports she may be forced to step aside if Shinawatra decides to sue the media outlets for libel.The rice scandal is just one example of the growing influence of the populist Thaksin Shinawatra, who has become Thailand's most popular prime minister since he was toppled by a military coup in 2006. The power he wields has been strengthened by a strong military and government, and his populist policies have helped propel him back into power. His biggest victory came four years ago when the military overthrew Thaksin's government, a decision made in part by his supporters in the military, which has a long history of backing the populist politician. Shinawatra has often said he was driven to power as Thailand's military was losing	0
John Travolta and Kelly Preston have returned to Ocala, Florida, with the remains of their teenage son, a family friend told CNN on Tuesday. Actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston say they are "heartbroken" Â with news their son died in July. The bodies of 16-year-old Matthew Travolta and 17-year-old Chandler Preston were found in his house in Palma, Florida, on July 13.Ocala police have identified the teen's body as that of 16-year-old Matthew Travolta. It wasn't immediately clear how the boy died, however.The Associated Press reported early on Tuesday that the bodies of 16-year-old Chandler Preston and 17-year-old Matthew Travolta, two of Travolta's three daughters, were found in his Palma home on July 13.Authorities say Chandler did not have a pulse when his body was found at the house and it took more than seven hours to revive him and make him breathe on his own before the teens' car was found on the property about 8:30 a.m. on July 13."They were really heartbroken," a family friend told the Associated Press on Tuesday. "We were talking about it last night and, you know, I knew it was going to happen. They never really got over it."The friend described Chandler as a cheerful teenager, who loved to sing, play guitar and play video games.Travolta was recently in Arizona where police are investigating a string of armed robberies of women in their homes in the Phoenix area. A police spokesman said there are no suspects at this time.Travolta is well known for his role in the movies "Saturday Night Fever" and "Raging Bull," was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won an Academy Award for best actor for his performance in the 1989 film "Saturday Night Fever."Preston recently appeared on "The Arsenio Hall Show" promoting a book about her childhood and relationship with her brother.The movie "Sex & The City" was filmed in Florida, where it was shot.A Florida hospital is treating two teenagers whose bodies were found in the basement of their Palma, Florida, home, authorities said on Tuesday.One 16-year-old girl died of a gunshot wound	0
Abu Dhabi stepped in to help troubled fellow emirate Dubai and its state-owned holding company, Dubai World, with $10 billion in financing on  Feb. 11. The deal came shortly after reports on the condition of Dubai World's assets. And, after reports that the firm was insolvent. The company's debt soared to $36.6 billion in the past three months, the highest level since it started the debt process in 1996, a person familiar with the situation said. Dubai officials refused to comment on the size of the potential bailout. "We don't comment on ongoing discussions or transactions," Emir of Dubai Sultan Ahmed Al-Abdali, chairman of Dubai Executive Committee, said in a statement. "The government of Dubai will decide in its discretion the terms and conditions of any transaction with respect to Dubai World." Officials of Abu Dhabi and Dubai had also begun negotiations on Feb. 1. In those talks, the companies sought to form a partnership or a special purpose company. Such a company would be "a strategic vehicle to bring together Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the entire region ... so that they would share in the region's best development prospects, thereby contributing to the region's growth," Abdul Rahman Al Kaabi, secretary general of Abu Dhabi Executive Council, told state-run news agency WAM. "For us, this is an opportunity ... to work hand in hand with the Abu Dhabi government," he said. Al Kaabi said he hoped to sign a cooperation agreement as early as next month. In January, Dubai World's finance chief for external affairs, Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Mubarak, said the Dubai World board was being restructured, but that Dubai World's finances were not in "serious" danger. "We are at the end of restructuring, but because we have been prudent, we did not fall into the red," he said. Abdulla, who was appointed to the post in September 1999, had said the company faced a debt crisis. "Dubai is not facing a crisis, but a restructuring of the company is required to give Dubai World sufficient time to restructure the company," he said. The report of insolvency was based on figures for June 20, after a number of public reports were published saying the company was in financial distress and facing bankruptcy. In July, Dubai Holdings, the	0
With extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states, there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers, consumers and the world's poorest populations alike -- about the ills of overexploitation and the benefits of conservation.The following are four such lessons to be learned by everyone concerned with food.1. The Farm Bill: the best opportunity to improve the food supplyCongress is moving on multiple fronts to improve the food supply and, not incidentally, improve the farmer's bottom line. The Farm Bill, a bipartisan effort to extend food assistance programs to an additional half million people, is a centerpiece of this effort. (The program is named the "Farm Family Support Program," and those over age 50 are eligible.) With the farm bill, and the accompanying farm bill extension, Congress aims to end hunger and poverty in America by improving the farm sector, which is the primary provider of food in the United States.The bill includes the nation's first major tax subsidies for agricultural commodities (including oilseeds), a new marketing order to promote biofuels and a measure of support for conservation programs, among other proposals. It is a chance for Congress to show good faith by acting to improve the well-being of farmers and ranchers.The bill also includes a measure to provide $2 billion for food assistance and an additional $500 million to expand farm family support programs to include schoolchildren. (Note that more than half the total budget for the farm bill is to be provided by the Agriculture Department, without the need for the usual Congressional appropriation.) All of this is evidence of Congress's commitment to the farm and food communities.Now, of course, the farm bill is only a part of the food reform effort. Food for All needs to extend beyond farm subsidies and into the public market. (Many small farmers would be lost without the income they receive under crop subsidies.) We need a Food Trust, along the lines of the New Deal Food Trust, that is a genuine program of public ownership of the food system. It would use market mechanisms to ensure the stability of the food and agricultural sector. This could be achieved, the argument goes, by guaranteeing loans for seed and fertilizer and a permanent loan program for production equipment, the kind of steps that were taken in the Farm Bill.2.

Every year the holidays bring cold weather, family gatherings, gift-giving, and of course, the perennial debate over the Constitution and Christmas. Recently, a Long Island school district drew criticism following a vernier-to-wolverine-to-motor-crossing game it was hosting for children. And in a case not made by the government, at least one person is arguing that the law has been violated.The lawsuit, filed by attorney Matthew W. Tinkham on behalf of two boys whose mother filed a complaint with the police, asks a federal court to overturn a New York law that prohibits parents from attending, observing, or otherwise endorsing ‘extreme sports’ for minors. The suit says the ban was never meant to apply to schools. The school district’s publicist says the school was not aware of the law when the school-sponsored games were played.The students’ parents argue that the decision to allow the boys to “run wild and play with dangerous equipment” was in the opinion of the school not in any of their children’s best interests. Parents say that the school district is discriminating against the parents’ own children. When the father of one of the boys attended a school-sponsored game, the boy’s friend told a teacher about the father’s visit and the boy’s “attitude changed”, the parents say in the lawsuit.The school’s publicist, the lawsuit says, told the parents that the school had a policy to take such concerns “under advisement” but “in the process, [the parents] made no requests for information about the program or any potential harm to your child’s physical and mental health or safety.” They did not ask to be excluded from the program, only a few minutes before the boys set off on the motor cross.We say: We can’t help our children watch the games. But we are doing something that should be protected.The law in question was passed as part of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The lawsuit claims that the government has not shown that the district violated COPPA. The state district’s publicist argues that the games were appropriate because there’s a need for competition among school divisions in the event of an emergency, and because the district is	0
Allies of Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday defeated an attempt by opposition leaders to impeach her on large-scale corruption charges -- the fourth such attempt in four years. Protesters display slogans in front of the House of Representatives in Manila on Tuesday. The House Justice Committee dismissed the impeachment complaint by 42-8 votes, saying that it was "insufficient in substance," the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. The complaint alleged that Arroyo and her husband were directly involved in an Internet broadband deal with a Chinese firm. The deal was ultimately scrapped amid allegations of corruption. "I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient," Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote. "The allegations are not allegations of fact. They are conclusions, opinion, inferences, and even arguments," Garcia said, according to the news agency. Arroyo first took office in 2001. Since then, she has survived four impeachment attempts and periodic rumors of coup. She won re-election in 2004, but opposition parties called into question the legitimacy of that race. During the vote count, Arroyo was tape-recorded talking to a senior election official, which opposition leaders charge is evidence she manipulated the outcome. The president has denied any wrongdoing. The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering. Congress rejected the charges. The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well. Her six-year term ends in 2010.	1
The International Olympic Committee has reinstated India, allowing its athletes to once again compete under their country's flag after a ban of more than a year. The reinstatement raises to 89 the number of  athletes who were allowed to compete under the Indian flag after the Supreme Court cleared them to compete under their country's flag.In the meantime, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were left out and unable to compete due to the IOC's ruling, which was not appealed."This is a historic day in the fight for sports, and a victory for common sense that puts athletes before governments and public opinion," IOC president Thomas Bach said. "Athletes worldwide should no longer be defined by the government or a select list of countries that offer preferential treatment."India now has the largest number of Olympic medals at six from four athletes. The Indian athletes have also been banned from competing in the Asian Games, and from competing in the Paralympic Games.The Indian Olympic Association has challenged the reinstatement of the country with immediate effect, but the ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne will remain in effect until the case is decided.According to the IOC, since it was not allowed to compete under its flag in any of the Olympic Games it contested from 2014 to 2018, India will have to compete under the Olympic flag in 2022 as well as 2016.In the meantime, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced that it will not send any athletes to the Paralympiad after ruling on this case as it has no jurisdiction to do so.In September this year, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that an Indian athlete had had a right to compete under the flag of India.This is a historic day in the fight for sports, and a victory for common sense that puts athletes before governments and public opinion. Athlete around the world should no longer be defined by the government or a select list of countries that offer preferential treatment. Thomas Bach, President of the IOCThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said India, which hosted the 2016 Paralympiad, had the right to compete with its Paralympiad competitors at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. The Court of Arbitration for Sport also said India had the right to compete with Paralympiad competitors at the Olympics in 2020.	0
Violence and heavy metal seem to have been inextricably entwined since the dawn of the metal genre. Accusations that the Columbine killers were influenced by Marilyn Manson's music were found to be false. Judas Priest,  the band that released their breakthrough album and single "Hell-Bent for Leather" in 1975, is considered one of the pioneers of heavy metal; in fact, the song that first gave the metal world its name became a worldwide hit for them. The Beatles, the greatest rock band of all time, were also heavy metal fans. Their drummer Pete Best, a big fan of American heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden, has said, "From what I hear, heavy metal was the primary influence on the Beatles."Of course, the Beatles were mostly influenced by classical music, which is why they were called "the most unmusical" band. Although, to be fair, they really did play a very heavy metal guitar riff on "I Saw Her Standing There."Many American heavy metal acts of the period played heavy metal music that was completely free of any major influences. Of course, not everyone agreed that this was the case, notably the Beatles, who insisted their music was influenced by classical music. It's likely that their musical influence on the Beatles was somewhat more subtle than that, though. In fact, Beatles biographer Michael N. Tods writes, "John, Paul, George, Ringo, and George's bassist/drummer, Pete Best, were the first to recognize that the songs of the Beatles had the power to change the nature of rock."Indeed, one could argue that American rock and roll was the most important influence on the Beatles. As we shall see, it had the power to transform classical music."The most important influence on the Beatles," Mike Tods writes, "was the music of the Beatles in the sixties. That is, not the British rock of the mid—twenties, but the new American folk, rock, and R&B in the sixties. No one else in the period can be said to have had quite the same influence."American musicians of the time, including country singer Alan Jackson, were especially important in this regard. One could argue Jackson was the most important of the American musicians because at the time he was the only major American performer who was playing an instrument other than guitar. His	0
New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles. ÂMayor Michael BloombergÂ said his new policy would also include limits on sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks. ÂThe proposal also would impose new restrictions on food advertising. ÂCurrently, in restaurants and other venues, drinks are sold in containers of 16 ounces or less, but the number of people who can drink them has grown far larger since the 1950s, and obesity rates are now rising. The new policy will bring the number down to 15 ounces or less, which is the lowest size that is still available.The Board of Health currently restricts the serving size for soda, sports drinks and energy drinks."Our new policy is designed to help people reduce sugar calories and to limit drinking times to no more than three or four drinks per hour," said Dr. Nirav D. Shah, chief of the Board of Health.Shah, chair of the New York City Department of Health, said reducing sugar calories is the most effective way to control obesity and to help keep residents from being labeled as obese by the Department of Health. ÂBloomberg said the new policy was the result of the growing obesity problem in his city.He said he thought some communities were starting to have "tipping point."He said that if cities across the country followed New York's lead, they too would reach a point at which they would have "tipping points."In New York City, people consume over 20 pounds of sugar per year, the mayor said. He said city residents have to think "big picture" about how to reduce obesity rates.By Chris Moeder11/07/2003New York TimesPage W-A4Copyright 2003 New York Times Company THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF HEALTH has proposed a new rule that would allow restaurants and bars to serve up to 15-ounce sodas, sports drinks and energy drinks in the city as long as they display the calorie content and list the ingredients carefully, rather than providing their own version of calorie counting.The board's decision followed an intensive public hearing that brought thousands of people to City Hall's landmark One Times Square building to urge the board to adopt a new rule that would allow the serving of sugary	0
The tea party-backed challenger who narrowly lost a Republican primary runoff in Mississippi to longtime Sen. Thad Cochran says he plans to file a legal challenge contesting those results "any day now." State Sen. Chris McDaniel said Friday on CNN's "New Day" that "the integrity of the process matters. We believe on that night of June 24 there were thousands of irregularities and we've already found thousands of irregularities in the process." McDaniel also defended his campaign's offer - announced Thursday - of rewards of $1,000 each for individuals providing "evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in voter fraud." And McDaniel said "we condemn any racist comments what so ever," when asked by CNN anchor Kate Bolduan about a bizarre Cochran campaign conference call on Wednesday that included borderline racist comments by an unidentified caller who appeared to be a supporter of the challenger's campaign. Led primary, lost runoff McDaniel narrowly edged Cochran in a June 3 primary, but with neither man cracking the 50% threshold needed to win, the contest moved to the runoff three weeks later, which Cochran won by fewer than 7,000 votes. His victory was aided by votes from African-American Democrats, who were actively courted during the runoff by Cochran's campaign and allied groups. According to Mississippi law, voters are not required to register with a political party, and anyone who doesn't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party's runoff. Since the runoff, McDaniel has refused to concede and has repeatedly vowed to use every legal maneuver available to fight the results. McDaniel alleges that some Democrats who voted in the runoff had previously cast a ballot in their party's Senate primary. "Right now, we have found we have found more than 5,000 irregularities. There are more than 19,000 absentee ballots we still haven't seen yet," McDaniel told CNN. Disputed claims The Cochran campaign disputes McDaniel's claims, and numbers. "The time has come now for the McDaniel campaign to put up or shut up. If they have hard evidence, bring it forward. But quit talking about exaggerated numbers that they know are not true," Cochran campaign spokesman and adviser Austin Barbour said Wednesday. After last week's runoff, McDaniel's campaign dispatched volunteers across Mississippi to investigate the results in the state's 82 counties.	1
Rory McIlroy's grip on the world number one spot in golf loosened Friday after a disastrous seven-over-par 79 at the European Tour's PGA Championship at Wentworth saw the Northern Irishman miss the cut. McIlroy had cut a frustrated and angry figure during an opening 74, but after a solid start to his second round he dropped a string of shots on the back nine. It opens the door for England's Luke Donald, who needs to finish in the top-eight in the Tour's flagship event to reclaim top spot. Donald, who is the defending champion, carded a second straight 68 to share second place on eight-under-par with Scot David Drysdale. They both trail runaway leader James Morrison who carded a superb eight-under 64 in calmer morning conditions to lead at halfway on 12-under 132. McIlroy faced an uphill battle to make the cut, but had recovered to stand one-under for the day through the seventh. But a double bogey on the eighth started the rot and he proceeded to card five straight bogeys and another double bogey on the 15th. For the 23-year-old, who also missed the cut at the Players Championship on the PGA Tour, it is hardly ideal preparation for his defense of the U.S. Open title next month. "It's been a week I'd like to forget. It's not nice to play like this and not nice two weeks in a row. Maybe it's a good thing I have two days off to practice and I'm looking to getting back to the States next week," he told gathered reporters. Donald, who can benefit the most from McIlroy's implosion, insisted that repeating his 2011 success on the Surrey course was his first priority. "To be honest, the focus is always to try and win the tournament," he told the official European Tour website. Morrison, who lives nearby, is looking to add to his 2010 Madeira Open success and finished in fine style with an eagle. A fine all-round sportsman, he played in the England under-17 cricket team with current Test players Alastair Cook and Tim Bresnan, but has never regretted turning to golf full time. "Playing golf is better than standing in the field all day," he jokingly told reporters. Peter Lawrie of Ireland and Spain's Alvaro Quiros shared fourth spot on seven-under.	1
NASA said Wednesday that it is collaborating with recording artist Mary J. Blige to encourage girls and young women to pursue careers by studying ʻscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics,' according to a news release.In the announcement NASA said the project will use 'new media to inspire the next generation of female engineers and scientists.'"Today, there are more than one million women in this country with bachelor's degrees in science or engineering and these are the only fields where women have reached the same rates as men," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in the release. "We should give them an equal opportunity to pursue careers and expand the opportunities for women in math, science and engineering." NASA's Office of Education will host an open forum to discuss the initiative, and then work with high school students to develop a digital campaign to spur interest in math, science, and engineering among girls and young women. "I do believe that our children deserve an education and they should have the opportunity to pursue whatever aspirations they aspire to in life," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in the release.

The Japanese coast guard has rescued a British woman on a solo round-the-world trip whose boat was damaged when it rolled several times during a tropical storm, her team said Friday. Sarah Outen was rescued by the coast guard in rough seas Friday afternoon, the London2London team wrote on its website. "Sarah is now making her way to back to Japan," the team wrote. "We are awaiting final confirmation of details of Sarah's arrival in Japan and will let you know more once we have further information." A nearby merchant vessel and a coast guard plane kept watch on Outen until the rescue ship arrived. Sarah Outen: Around the world on two boats and a bike A small amount of water had gotten into the cabin of Outen's boat, Gulliver, but she was "bearing up well and demonstrating the strength and resolve that has brought her the huge distance on the journey so far," the team said before her rescue. She asked for pancakes, cold orange juice and grapes for her first meal after arriving in Japan. Planning a round-the-world trip Coincidentally, a second solo British rower is about 280 miles northeast of Outen's position and is also awaiting rescue, Outen's team said. Charlie Martell departed Japan last month on a quest to row 6,000 miles across the Pacific, his website says. Outen managed to send updates on Twitter while waiting for rescue, writing, "Trying hard2 smile and breathe calm keep getting interuptd by waves throwing us over." (sic) "Focusing on calm trying2 block out wind and waves. Visualizing family and friends pulling us in." Sarah Outen: Volunteering with victims of Japanese tsunami Outen began her solo circumnavigation April 1, 2011, in London with plans to cycle, row and kayak more than 20,000 miles. She hopes to finish in London in autumn 2013. She is halfway to her goal. Her team says she has already cycled and kayaked more than 11,000 miles, going through countries including Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and China. Outen is traveling alone, assisted by a London-based team that includes doctors, a weather forecaster and a sports psychotherapist. CNN's Kyung Lah in Tokyo contributed to this report.	1
A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund. The Cat Ba leopard gecko Â?Â?was found in the southern province of Quang Binh, northern Vietnam.The Greater Mekong region, encompassing Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, is famous for its biodiversity, with more than 50 per cent of species found there having been discovered in the past 30 years. The region is also home to a high density of endemic species, with most of the remaining species restricted to the region.This report is intended to showcase some of the species discovered in the Greater Mekong region last year. The Greater Mekong region is home to the highest diversity of amphibians, and it is also home to some of the highest diversity of freshwater fish and birds. The region is rich in biodiversity, with more than 50 per cent of species discovered in the past 30 years, with many of those species restricted to the region.Although this report by the World Wildlife Fund was originally published in January 2016, the information below is a year old now.

If the U.S. election race conjures up images of mud flying through the air for many Japanese, campaigning politicians in the Land of the Rising Sun evoke visions of a more white-gloved affair. Japan's politics are as  political as they are in any country; they are largely defined by who sits in cabinet. That leaves the role of the prime minister to one of the country's two political parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) or the Japan Socialist Party (JSP).A prime minister's prime job is to set the agenda of a country's government and to shape its policies. The incumbent, Keizo Obuchi, is a centrist who has been in office since 1996, and his term has been an uneventful one. Yet the U.S., which has its own prime minister, was never going to let Japan's main party, an old-looking man sitting in the prime minister's office, be in charge of its government. There are many reasons for this, not least of which are the fact that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who led the Liberal Democratic Party for eight years, was an out-and-out liberal. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, was a party devoted to the welfare state, the only party in Japan that was committed to the policy of free-market economics as a way to bring prosperity to the country.Japan's government is, therefore, a strange one because of the way the two parties have functioned together in the past. Prime ministers who were LDP members like Koizumi and Obuchi did not seek to make Japan socialist. They did not do everything that they could to undermine the government of prime minister Suzuki Teruzuki who won a landslide victory in 1993, and they did not wish to follow in his footsteps as much as they did to ensure that they would not lose power.It is only the recent leadership change that has changed this. That change came in 1996, when Keizō Obuchi took over as prime minister and he was a LDP member. One year later, when Obuchi's term as prime minister was ending, Prime Minister Koizumi announced his intention to return to the LDP.This change in prime ministers has brought the two parties into conflict more than ever before. In the short run, the LDP has won the majority of seats in parliament because of the landslide in 1993. Many supporters of the	0
Based on Mick Jagger's serious expression and Keith Richards' focused stare, it was clear the pressure was on. It was the summer of 1972, and the Rolling Stones were on their American concert tour for their acclaimed "Exile on  E" album, which included the critically acclaimed "Start Me Up." The tour was only eight weeks long, and yet it had already proved far more than a money grab. The Stones were becoming legends and legends were being built.The show was in Boston, Massachusetts, on Sunday night, July 24, 1972. It was their first concert that year in New England. The Stones drew an enormous response from the sold-out audience, filled with screaming girls, the soundman's assistant, and a good-looking young guy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The band had arrived in Boston just in time to be part of the festivities. The Rolling Stones had appeared before a packed house at the New York Coliseum, and now they were back for their first performance in Boston.Onstage, there was an air of tension as the opening notes of the song "Honky Tonk Woman" were played. As the lyrics came over the speakers, the audience erupted with screams of "NO!" and "STOP!" The show went on as planned and the fans responded with a thunderous response to "I Wanna Be Your Man."Onstage, Mick Jagger looked like a man who had been slapped in the face with a three-by-five stick. Keith Richards, on bass, was in his element, singing the lyrics at the top of his lungs. Brian Jones, on lead guitar, was the rhythm guitarist and played with incredible confidence.Onstage, the audience was all at one time or another being beaten up by the Stones. In the middle of the night, a fan ran through the crowd, yelling, "Hey, Mick, stop screaming. It's an invasion of your privacy." As Mick looked over at him, the man said, "You don't pay us enough attention."The next day, the tour bus picked up the group at a hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The bus contained all their luggage: a suitcase, three guitars, a bass, two drum kits, and a drum machine. The drums were set up on a wooden platform, near the front of the bus. The setlist included their first hit "You Can't Always Get What You Want,"	0

Xi Jinping is a mystery. So much so that the presumed leader-in-waiting of the world's most populous nation could vanish for more than a week without any explanation being given. In September this year, Xi disappeared. It sparked a flurry of rumors: he'd had a heart attack, suffered a stroke, was injured swimming, and had even gone on strike. Xi eventually re-appeared and normal transmission was resumed. But should we be so surprised? Barely an analyst I've spoken to can say they really know him, or what type of leader he would be. Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S-China Institute, has seen China's leaders come and go but concedes Xi is difficult to read. "Xi Jinping is in many ways an unknown commodity. He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks," Chinoy said. CNNMoney: Economy key to China's transition But this is not an era characterized by leaders such as Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, Chinoy added. The China of the 21st century has no supreme leader. The modern Chinese Communist Party is run by a small collective, the nine members of Politburo Standing Committee of which Xi is expected to be the next leader. This is an opaque system. It is a transition worked out behind doors -- nothing is left to chance and little is revealed to the Chinese people. As the United States prepares to elect its next president this week, a very different, more selective "democracy" is taking place in China. The 18th Communist Party Congress will come together on November 8 to chart a new course for the country, say farewell to the old leadership and usher in a new generation. More than 2,200 delegates from across China will gather for the Congress, and they in turn select the 200 plus members of the party's Central Committee, who in turn appoint the Politburo and ultimately the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee -- the country's decision makers. But most, if not all, of the outcomes are predetermined. The Congress itself meets every five years. It is designed to assess the country's progress, and set new directions. Every ten years it selects the new leadership.	1
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can expect an apology from Premier League referees chief Keith Hackett following his dismissal in the closing seconds of Saturday's 2-1 English Premier League defeat to Manchester United. Arsene lled out with his players at half-time, but he received a letter from Hackett which he will later read aloud in front of his players.The letter, in the form of a fax, was sent to Arsenal at 2.55pm on Sunday and addressed to him. Here are some key excerpts from the fax:"I have to say that I am deeply disappointed with refereeing on Saturday and the way referee Keith Hackett handled the matter and handled the players.This is not the first time you have been disciplined by me. This is not the first time that you have been disciplined by the referee. It is the first time that I have seen you disciplined at all. I believe it is because you have become a player who is not prepared to accept the rules.It did not escape me that you took the referee's decision to dismiss the players outside the field of play. You also took the referee's decision to make 11 substitutions at half time. If you were ever to continue to be a professional referee, you will not be disciplined again.It is not acceptable that you are acting like a professional referee and behave this way.I am deeply disappointed with you and wish you well for the future.I am sorry for the disappointment my decision has caused you all, and you will understand that I will not tolerate any further misconduct from you.I am sorry that you were not present at the referee's meeting this afternoon, as you were asked to be in attendance. Hopefully, you will attend today.I am sorry for any offence that has been caused as a result of my decision.I hope to return to England in the near future and I will meet with you all as soon as possible.I am very sorry for the disappointment of my decision to dismiss you. I have spoken to our club management with a view to finding another way of managing our referees.It has been a difficult decision that I do not take lightly.I wish you all well for the future and I will make your case with the club as soon as possible."Wenger said: "We are all very sorry for anything that has happened the last couple of days	0
Maram scrunches up her little nose and pauses as she remembers. The eight-year-old was daddy's favorite. "When he was going to work he was shot," she says. By whom, no one can say for sure, but Syria's ills always seemed to touch her father. It was as if by age eight, he'd begun to feel like a part of them.In mid-June, when she was five, a man on a motorbike pulled up next to their home and asked for money. He had a gun, and he told her, "If I don't have some, you will die." He drove off.She looked at her mother and asked, "Where's Daddy?"Her mother said, "He's upstairs. He must have gone to your friend's house."As soon as they finished, they rushed upstairs and found their father, shot in the shoulder. He was dead by then, but still the girl found herself screaming, "Why can't I see him? Where's my daddy?" And then she remembered that she did have a "friend" whom she hadn't seen since the day before.That day, she says, she saw her mother take the little girl out of school in a bright yellow school bag. She said something she had never seen before – the family ate breakfast, and the little girl in her yellow school bag ate bread and jam, then went off to a friend's house. No one saw her again.In the weeks and months that followed, the girl lived with an aunt who didn't speak English. She says that her aunt never offered her a change to go to school, but when she grew sick and tired, her mother took her to a doctor. When she returned home and told of the doctor's report, the girl's father took her at once and took her to the same doctor, and for a long time they saw him every day. He was the sole caretaker of his son's sick daughter."We had to fight for everything," says the girl.

The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea. Revolutionary music pumped through loudspeakers wafts over to China. Back across the river, work groups can be seen stirring for a day's toil in the fields. Over here in China, a tourist tout is trying to sell us North Korean currency. "Good price!" he shouts. This is daily life in Dandong, China -- a thriving border town within throwing distance of the Hermit Kingdom. Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards. Signs all along the border warn against throwing goods over the fence, as if it's some kind of zoo. And, in a way, that's what it has become. Chinese tourists now flock to Dandong -- which lies along China's western border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- to ogle at their unfortunate neighbors. Some pay a few RMB to borrow binoculars to peer across the river, while the more adventurous take speedboats and pleasure cruises out on the river, which acts a natural barrier between the two neighbors. "Go inside North Korea!" a sign for one local boat company proclaims. Perhaps the Chinese come to marvel at how far they have come. With decades of breakneck growth, Communist China has become a testament to capitalism and urban living. North Korea, which also describes itself as a socialist state, is still sealed and secretive -- almost. Lifeline Dandong is the lifeline, say critics, of the autocratic regime led by Kim Jong Un. Whole neighborhoods in the back streets of the city are lined with trading shops quietly run by North Korean officials. China is North Korea's largest trading partner by a long way, and despite Beijing's official displeasure with the DPRK's pursuit of nuclear weapons, this trade continues to grow. China has rebuffed any attempts to strengthen economic sanctions further against Pyongyang. Up to 70% of all China trade with North Korea runs through Dandong, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, and it takes the form of both legal trade and illegal smuggling. We meet "Chen," a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers.	1
Saudi Arabia's quest for a fourth Asian Cup title, and first since 1996, is over after they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Jordan in Doha on Thursday. A mistake from goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah sealed Saudi Arabia's fate, as the kingdom slumped to their second successive defeat following their surprise 2-1 loss to Syria on Sunday. Last weekend's defeat saw the instant dismissal of Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro, but his replacement Nasser Al Johar failed to get the victory the Saudi's needed to keep their tournament alive, despite making four changes to his side. An ominous sign for the 2022 World Cup? The only goal of the game came three minutes before half-time against the run of play. There looked no danger when Baha Abdelrahman floated in a cross from the right hand side, but Abdullah completely misjudged the flight of the ball and could only watch on in horror as it looped into the net. Despite the shock nature of their exit, Al Johar was philosophical about the defeat. "We played very well and we created opportunities to score, especially in the second half," he told reporters. "But we were not lucky and this is football. Maybe we'll do better in the future," he added. The result means Saudi Arabia become the first team to bow out of the competition and puts Jordan level on points with Japan at the top of the group. Meanwhile, Group B favorites Japan claimed a hard fought 2-1 win over Syria in the day's other match to move onto four points after their two matches. Japan were never at their best against committed opponents, who would have qualified for the knockout stages with another victory, and a tense encounter saw both teams finish with 10 men. Captain Makoto Hasebe opened the scoring for the three-time champions in the 35th minute, finding the corner of the net with a well-placed strike after some superb individual play from Keisuke Honda. However, Syria levelled in controversial fashion with 14 minutes remaining, when Firas Al Khatib netted from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima had fouled Sanharib Malki -- despite the player being flagged offside. Japan's players protested vehemently but the Iranian referee stuck by his decision, sending off Kawashima in the process.	1
She was named Sara, after the daughter of the man who found her, and she got to go home Wednesday. For her, home is the waters of the Florida Keys, a place no one expected she'd ever return to. Sara is a 115-pound federally ursine-rescue-dog mix, about the size of a beagle. Her former owner said she was found in a dumpster with her collar off."I've got no idea where she came from," the owner said. "I've never seen her before, not once."According to the Humane Society of the United States, an estimated 300,000 dogs and other pets are abandoned every year in the U.S. But this is an out-of-state homeless animal, like a coyote or fox."In our city, there are some homeless animals that are like coyotes, they go after goats," said Robert J. O'Neil, chief of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force.O'Neil said he doesn't think the case is typical of the homeless animals that can be found in areas around Miami. It could be a stray or an abandoned animal."If someone comes across it, it's one of those kinds," O'Neil said.It's also possible that the animal might have been living with someone who doesn't mind them being there."There are some people who like their animals to be in the house where they sleep," O'Neil said. "They've got an animal, and they say, 'Well, I don't mind if you have it at night.' And if it's at night and you have to turn your head in the direction of the animal, he gets scared ... or he starts to think he has to defend himself."A lot of people find themselves in this situation, said Linda Smith, spokeswoman for the Humane Society of the United States. They've got an animal, but they're not sure they'll be able to keep them."If the animal is a house animal, then a lot of people say, 'I'm not going to be able to have it,'" Smith said. "There are some people who believe there's a difference between a cage-free kennel and a pet, where the animal has the opportunity to be outside."But what they're really saying is they need to get	0
Pink hair, piercings and the name Emily -- Iowa father Paul Plate saw his own teenage daughter as he read about a different Emily's harrowing experience with synthetic marijuana. Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter. But reading about Emily Bauer, a Texas high school student left brain-damaged after smoking "potpourri" she bought at a convenience store, really put him in her parents' shoes. "I felt horrible for her. I know we all do stupid things as kids, but to have an outcome like this is dreadful," said Plate, one of the thousands of readers who took the time to comment on the CNN.com story. "I am a sucker for my little girl, so I know how I would feel in their place." Bauer's tale set off warning bells for parents across the country: What is this drug? Why didn't her family keep her from smoking it? What should I tell my kids? What if that were my daughter? The teenager's symptoms of psychosis and strokes would jolt just about any parent into a conversation about the dangers of synthetic marijuana. Add in the statistics about the drug's popularity -- one in every nine U.S. high school seniors has admitted to smoking fake weed, according to a 2011 study -- and parents were alarmed. Opinion: Regulate fake pot, it's not going away While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid. "The story points to another example of people who shouldn't be allowed to be parents," wrote Lynn DeArmond, who added she was thankful Emily is recovering. She said her six children understand that using weed is unacceptable and they would face consequences if they smoked it. "Parents need to start being parents instead of friends. To do otherwise results in these kind of stories or worse." On the other side of the debate were parents who might allow their children to smoke real marijuana if that would keep them from experiencing Emily's fate. One dad argued for its legalization and suggested monitoring children while they try pot. "Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible," commenter Rob Doerr wrote.	1
In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins. Since then, the populous Latin American nation of 122 million has invested in  urban renewal and in creating its largest and most famous city: San Salvador.In June 2011, the San Salvador Archaeological and Historical Park was established. The National Museum of Salvador is located in the same plaza as the historic center. The park houses an assortment of archaeological artifacts and a collection of indigenous and pre-Columbian artifacts. It was established in 1982, making it one of the oldest parks in the country.San Salvador is a city with something for everyone, from the traditional Mayan sites to the modern art museums, museums and shopping centers to the beaches and beaches! This city offers a combination of historic architecture and modern urban development.I have taken this trip before but it's definitely worth a second look! It's easy to get lost on this side of the country so I wanted to take more pictures. It's very walkable so there's no need to worry about finding a place to park. As long as you don't leave the car running you'll have a great time. After arriving at the port you walk out the front door to the beach and end up walking the last block to the downtown.The San Salvador Historical Center/Architecture Tour is located in the center of San SalvadorI spent a couple of days in San Salvador (and now in Belize) on my way back to Panama and I have to say that it was wonderful to be out and about again in the city. The hotels and restaurants were very good and the weather was perfect! I wish I was able to stay longer!This blog has been running for about a year, I think!

A total solar eclipse occurred over the northeastern Australian coast early in the morning of November 14 local time. Clueless about this spectacular astronomical event? No worries, we've got you covered. We're here to explain what causes this  most iconic of eclipses and their accompanying phenomena.Eclipses happen once a year every spring, but only five total solar eclipses have ever occurred in the course of human history. The first one, of course, is the famous Total Lunar Eclipse of 1919, which happened over Chile. The first total solar eclipse of this year occurred in Tuscany at 14:09 CET on 13 June, when the moon came from behind the sun and only partially covered the disk of Earth; this was a rarity then, and occurred only once in the first millennium, making it the longest-lasting total solar eclipse of all time.What causes a total solar eclipse of this nature?When Earth passes between the sun and a distant star (in the case of a total solar eclipse), we are not only watching an eclipse of the sun, but also a partial solar eclipse of the Earth. What makes solar eclipses of this type such a remarkable phenomenon is that while the moon passes through the solar disk and blocks out the sun's light, the Earth's disk also becomes completely unshaded, like a paper cup that's been filled with so much water that it can't be seen through; this makes it look like the disk of the Earth is completely uncovered, just as if the moon had passed through the full disk of the Earth and left the sun completely in its shadow, thus creating a total lunar eclipse.The solar eclipse takes place when the sun, Earth, and moon have lined up perfectly to block out the light from the sun. The sun's light is made up as much as 95% of the energy behind the partial solar eclipse of Earth; the remainder (the moon's light) is about 5%.The main causes of this type of eclipse occur when the Earth passes between the sun and a star (in the case of a total solar eclipse), or when certain "sunspots" are present. The solar eclipse is caused by an obscuration of both the sun and the moon; when the Earth passes exactly between the sun and the moon, the light from the moon is blocked completely, and the sun is completely obscured by the Earth's disk. The sun's disk is dark from approximately 5:30 to	0
It's the YouTube equivalent of a roundhouse kick in the face. Remember last month's viral vernacular exchange? The video of the moment was a live-blog-style conversation that was so fast-paced that it's hard to follow for non-subscribers. With over six million views and counting, the video was uploaded to YouTube, and the debate took place under the radar of all but the most die-hard viewers of the video uploader.And now it returns courtesy of The Daily Dot, who found the video's creator, user "taylorrbradley," on the "How To" section of his YouTube channel. His response is to share five tips for making a successful YouTube video."I had a ton of fun making this video, and hope you do the same, even if you're not filming a video right now," the video begins with a simple, clear message: "You want to make a video to be great, but there's a couple things you need to do to build the foundation for it.""If you’re going to start a successful YouTube channel, this article will help you get started!" read the bottom of the video. "I was inspired by this video when I first started mine; I hope it will help you as well!"Here are the five things he did to turn a fun video into a successful one.1. Know your audience.One of the biggest issues with YouTube tutorials is that there's no way for readers to actually understand the concepts. And that's especially true when the content is just being passed around a circle of friends, coworkers and family.The first step to a successful video is realizing that you know no actual audience exists. The second major piece of advice here is to get out and spend time with your friends and family so they better understand what you're talking about.2. Create a video about what you're doing right now.This step is so important that he spends a solid 20 minutes in the video getting this step off the ground. He starts by talking about how to tell the story of what he's doing right now: "If you make a video that shows an everyday chore or how I did something in the past, viewers will get to know you and your audience a little bit."As long as he's got a point to make and isn't trying to be a	0
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg found himself facing questions Thursday about why the city was paying for more than 100 vacant hotel rooms when thousands were displaced after Superstorm Sandy. The rooms were reserved for storm victims Â? a city official said.Bloomberg was also asked for the city,s policy on evacuations and relocation for residents who don,t have a place to live.On Dec. 19, Bloomberg was asked about the hotel rooms, where he told reporters: &We do the best we can. We pay for 100 rooms, as we did with the World Trade Center. We pay for them through the Red Cross. We provide the rooms ourselves. As you know the hotel industry is struggling this year. We are the ones that are going to help people who need a place to stay while they are waiting for FEMA to come down here.8The city announced Thursday it would pay $26.6 million to the Red Cross to handle the claims of displaced New Yorkers. The city will also pay $10.4 million for hotel room vouchers to displaced Sandy victims, which will also be funded by the state.Bloomberg said Thursday he agreed with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Jr.,s decision to pay for those hotel rooms, which he said were made available when the hotel was being renovated.As for the question of emergency evacuations, Bloomberg said the city is monitoring the recovery from Sandy and has a plan in place.&The city is in a position to handle more than 10,000 calls from residents who do not have a place to go,8 Bloomberg said.In the past week, the city has responded to some 2,320 calls for service from people who don,t have a place to go.The mayor said the people who have no place to go may be able to live with family, friends, neighbors or within a church that has a place to live.In response to the questions about how the city plans to help people who have been displaced after Sandy, Bloomberg said, &We have a plan in place. We have a plan to provide help to anybody in need.8The mayor also said the city is preparing for any new or additional problems that Sandy brings.He said the city is preparing for snow and ice, and is working with the police department to keep emergency lights on and vehicles off the streets.	0
Most Americans think of the Arctic as an icy, distant place; beautiful, remote and teeming with wildlife, but unrelated to their daily lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. This summer, big doings on America's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic, strategic and environmental future of the nation. Yet we are unprepared for the challenges and opportunities. What happens in the Arctic as ice melts there could soon cheapen the cost of the gas you buy and products you purchase from Asia. It could help make the nation more energy independent. It could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory. It is already challenging Washington to protect millions of square miles filled with some of the most magnificent wildlife on Earth, and native people whose culture and way of life is at risk as a squall line of development sweeps across the once inaccessible top of the planet. Opinion: It's time to develop our Arctic resources For America, the stakes are huge: A chance to gain wealth and global influence in the newest geopolitical playing field, but there is also potential environmental and security disaster if looming challenges are mishandled or ignored. If that sounds farfetched, consider the following: -- Shell is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of Alaska in a few weeks. The operation will assess whether an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil is there. This is roughly three times the amount that has been extracted from the Gulf of Mexico over the past 20 years. Shell Oil ship slips anchor; incident raises questions about Arctic drilling plan Proponents believe a discovery would cut America's dependence on foreign oil and provide jobs and needed revenue to the Treasury Department. They say the oil could be extracted safely. Opponents fear a spill would be a disaster, being difficult to clean up in icy seas. More oil companies wait in the wings and also own offshore leases. -- In Washington, politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify "The Law of the Sea Treaty," under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves. For the U.S., that could mean extra territory the size of California off Alaska.	1
You might call her a watchdog, because this Boston area Doberman really has a thing for timepieces. She recently ate three. Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps. "My husband, who's the most calm person that I know, called me up and said, 'I'm not quite sure if I should panic,' " said Courcelle's wife, Michele Parkinson. The 80-pound Doberman, whom her owners describe as "more goofy than scary," had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents. Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own. The couple took her to the MSPCA's Angell Animal Medical Center, a 24-hour emergency and specialty hospital, where a veterinarian performed a 3-hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly. Mocha was a repeat offender: Just last summer, she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine. She had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed, Parkinson said. Fortunately this time, the jewelry remains were still in Mocha's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract. The X-ray, however, was disturbing. Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces. "It just looked like a Christmas tree and I almost threw up," Parkinson said. The veterinarian removed "about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus" during the endoscopy, and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces, MSPCA spokesman Rob Halpin said. As of Friday, Mocha was no worse for wear. The hospital sees dozens of cases each week of dogs ingesting foreign objects, and is trained to look for the symptoms of blockages -- typically lethargy, not eating and vomiting, Halpin said.	1
When they can see the world, save cash and get that surgery you wanted, it's no wonder that increasing numbers of travelers are hopping on a jet in search of cut-price healthcare. The worldwide medical tourism industry is said to be growing by up to 25% each year as patients with passports head abroad for procedures costing as much as 80% less than at home. Partly fueled by 1.2 million Americans, it's a sector now estimated to be worth up to $55 billion. But where are the best destinations for medical tourism? Last month, the UK-based International Medical Travel Journal staged its first annual award ceremony recognizing what it says are the top facilities offering treatment to visitors. While many of these establishments offer care for potentially life-threatening cancer or heart problems, patients are just as likely to be seeking cosmetic work to their face, teeth or torso. IMTJ's managing editor Keith Pollard says the awards, staged in Dubai, are the industry's first independent stamps of approval on medical tourism providers. Airline travel discounts part of package "All our winners exemplify the way the medical tourism industry should be run -- professional, offering exceptional patient care and providing the best possible medical outcomes," Pollard says. The IMTJ divided its winners into categories, including best hospital, specialist patient center, dental clinic, fertility clinic, travel agency and website. Malaysia emerged as one of the prime destinations, with victories in three categories. Gleneagles Kuala Lumpur, a 330-bed care center that offers airline travel discounts to inbound patients on its website, took the hospital accolade. Kuala Lumpur's Prince Court Medical Center won best fertility clinic, while its International Dental Specialist Center was named as the best place for teeth tuneups. Jordan was named as the best overall destination for what judges said was a remarkable success in handling 250,000 international patients.

Someone in the Obama White House clearly has a good book to write one day: "How Not to Do Rollouts." With one hapless episode after another, the rollout of the President's plan to destroy ISIS is beginning to rival the less-than-splendid debut of the Obamacare website. President Barack Obama's critics may take some glee from the recent missteps, but they shouldn't. Going to war is serious business, especially when the conflict promises to be long and messy. For the nation's sake, our dysfunctional politics needs to become functional on this one or we put too much at risk, starting with the lives of our men and women in uniform. That's why it is imperative and urgent that the Obama team and their allies take a deep breath, pull themselves together and get this war effort on solid footing. Instead of becoming defensive, they need to go on offense, showing the world they are firmly in charge and on a winning path. Ever since the President went on prime-time television to announce his new strategy to "degrade and destroy" ISIS, he and his team have slipped on one banana peel after another. First came the series of muddled messages. Was this to be called a war or something else like a counterterrorism campaign? Who knew after so many contradictions from the administration? Is the threat from ISIS something we are trying to prevent from happening one day or is it imminent? Again, contradictions. Crucially: Still we put boots on the ground or will we leave all the ground fighting to surrogates? No one can be sure yet. Even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support, questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do. Meanwhile, the media has been jammed with news analyses and comments from respected former officials calling into question the whole enterprise. The administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted Iraqi military along with Kurdish forces, working with American air power, can destroy ISIS in Iraq, but so far, press reports are skeptical. And experts point out that the best Iraqi fighters are Shia militia allied with Iran. There is even more skepticism about our capacity to mobilize "moderates" in Syria. And listening to two of Obama's former defense chiefs, Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, one suspects they would have strongly opposed the plan if they were still in government.	1
believed to be ISIS members -- attacked several Iraqi security posts and checkpoints in western Iraq's Anbar province Tuesday morning, leaving at least 11 people dead and 18 others wounded, security officials in Iraq said. The attacks, involving a suicide bomber, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, happened in the town of Jubbat al Shamiya, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad, security officials in the Anbar capital of Ramadi said. Anbar is a western province largely controlled by ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has used brutal tactics such as mass kidnappings, beheadings and other abuses against civilians and armed foes to capture vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years. Most of those killed and wounded in Tuesday's attacks were Iraqi security force and local Awakening Council members, the security officials said. Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, are made up of Sunni Muslim fighters who turned against al Qaeda and have been active in Iraq since 2006. The U.S.-backed councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across Iraq a few years ago, after the strife that followed the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003. But council members recently have become targets for ISIS, which has waged war to establish what it says is an Islamic caliphate. Also Tuesday, ISIS militants attacked the Albu Risha police station in northern Ramadi, killing several police officers and injuring at least two other people, the security officials said. The battle for the station began early Tuesday, the Ramadi security officials said. After about two hours of clashes between ISIS militants and police officers, ISIS managed to take over the station. Ramadi is about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad. The Anbar capital has been one of the province's few holdouts against ISIS. Anbar is home to Al Asad Air Base, where 320 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, are stationed as part of an effort to advise and assist Iraqi forces fighting ISIS. ISIS' campaign, and the military response to it by Iraqi forces supported by air power from a U.S.-led international coalition, left a bloody toll in Iraq in 2013. At least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in Iraq last year, roughly double the number recorded in 2013, according to the Iraq Body Count monitoring project.	1

Four members of a group of 31 North Koreans who accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat, have decided to defect to the  Republic of Korea, Yonhap reported on Monday.While the North Koreans were on the fishing trawler, the country’s intelligence bureau was watching them. A South Korean navy patrol ship and a Russian boat intercepted the boat, arresting the crew who were on their way to bring in fish when they were spotted."The North Koreans realized that we were watching them, and that the North Korean government was involved, so they were happy," South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director Suh Jong-ho said, according to the Yonhap report.Yonhap also reported that the defectors were in good health. They are among about 1,000 North Koreans who have already crossed into South Korea illegally in a bid to flee from the North's harsh economic conditions.The South Korean government is looking into ways to block North Korean ships, which it says have no right to leave South Korean waters, from entering its watersA total of about 1,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed into South Korea in a bid to flee from the North's harsh economic conditions.The news comes after the Supreme Court of Korea rejected the North's appeal to the Constitutional Court of Korea and ruled the constitution does not allow the government to bar North Koreans at the border from leaving the country.The United Nations has said it has no official information regarding the situation in North Korea.The U.S. is concerned about what it calls North Korea's "troubling proliferation of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles," according to Yonhap.China is among the countries that has threatened North Korea with serious military response if the isolated nation acts aggressively.In 2013, South Korean prosecutors said about 1,000 U.S. soldiers deserted to North Korea during the Korean War without the knowledge of their superiors and even with the help of the North Korean military.The North Korean military has been accused of abducting 46 South Koreans by the South Korean government and holding them against their will.

We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360," about Alex Teves, one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in xtown. We learned that Teves, an African-American man with whom Cooper was having something of a love affair after the two met at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards, was shot five times.We learned that he had been planning to take his mother to see a movie at the theater on Monday night — it had not been her birthday — so that was not the killing point. We learned that Teves was attending the theater as a part of "Project Green," an initiative launched in February 2010 to bring awareness to a problem that has long plagued the theater industry.We learned that, contrary to what his mother said, Teves was not an active participant in the Occupy movement, despite the fact that many of the protesters were protesting his and other arrests for public drinking. We learned that, contrary to what the police said, there were no protesters in the front of the theater at the time of the shooting.We learned, too, that the man who shot Teves, Darren Scott, 21, was also arrested but released and that the murder of Teves on Monday was "justified," in the words of a police spokesperson. And a police spokesperson told me that Teves was "just an innocent bystander."And we learned, too, that Cooper did not try to reach the mother of Teves because she is not on his radar.But the news we learned on Tuesday, the night Anderson Cooper covered all of this on "AC360," was not new. It was new to the public. And maybe new to you, but not much of it was new to Anderson Cooper.We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360."We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360."We learned that Alex Teves was murdered in what police say was a justified attempt to stop a robbery.

In Florida, one could coin a new term for black bears: Pets. Or maybe: Pests. Some have gotten into the habit, it seems, of visiting neighborhoods there, and on Thursday, one was caught literally hanging around -- in a Daytona Beach man's hammock. "He got in the hammock like he was a tourist or something," homeowner Vincent James told CNN affiliate WESH. Usually, James is the one lounging on his back in the white rope mesh hanging between two trees. The bear enjoyed the respite enough to savor it. He -- or she -- stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes, said photographer Rafael Torres, who snapped pictures of the bear from 60 feet away. Torres' presence did not seem to disturb the wild animal's repose. Residents say the bear has been scrounging for food in the neighborhood since Wednesday, ripping through garbage cans and knocking down bird feeders. Aw, isn't that cute? Torres and James may have enjoyed the visit by the large, furry character lumbering among the ranks of chirping birds and foraging squirrels on their lawns, but other Floridians haven't shared their glee. In April, a black bear attacked a woman in her garage and dragged her out onto the driveway. She claimed it was a posse of five bears that roughed her up, but authorities said it was only one. But there was a handful of black bears roaming the neighborhood at the time of the attack, they said. Don't feed the bears! Wildlife officials also discourage the warm, fuzzy feeling some residents have for the black bears, pointing to the dangers they pose. Wildlife law enforcement officers arrested an 81-year-old woman from Sebring in February for feeding loads of dog food to bears on her property. She dished out up to 18 bowls at a time to furry bunches gathered in her yard. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warned her multiple times to stop, but she would not, for fear the animals would starve without her. Officers were afraid the bears would get hazardously close to humans, and they killed one bear that was frequenting her feedings. Once a bear feels too at home among people, relocating it doesn't help, the FWC said back then. It will keep coming back.	1
Many Californians were startled awake Monday night and early Tuesday morning by Amber Alerts that made screeching noises on their cell phones. Some people even took to Twitter to complain. They better get used to it. The alerts about a blue Nissan -- possibly carrying Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in California under a new program that sends Amber Alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones. The texts are accompanied by a high-pitched squealing sound to get the phone owner's attention. Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped from her California home in 1993 and later found dead, was an unlikely critic of Monday's statewide alerts, telling CNN that while the messages were well intended, their rollout was "pretty abysmal." He feared residents might be put off by the harsh noise and opt out of the program. Cell phones have been receiving Amber Alerts since 2005 under a partnership between the wireless industry, the U.S. Justice Department and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for. They would then only receive alerts for those chosen areas, regardless of where they were physically located. So you could be from Nebraska but vacationing in Florida, for example, and not get an Amber Alert about an abduction a dozen miles from your Tampa hotel. That system was replaced on December 31, 2012, by the Wireless Emergency Alert program, run by FEMA, which sends free, automatic notifications to almost every phone in the surrounding area or even the state. Cellphone owners now receive Amber Alerts, as well as emergency weather alerts, based on their proximity to the emergency, not the location of their phone number. And people must opt out if they prefer not to get the alerts. HLN: What you should know about mobile Amber Alerts The messages are sent over a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast and aren't affected by congestion that might disrupt regular calls and text messages, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. About 100 Amber Alerts, sent simultaneously to all compatible mobile devices within range of the cellular towers in the affected area, have been sent nationwide so far under the Wireless Emergency Alert program.	1
The Producers Guild of America has announced its 10 nominees for Best Picture of the Year, and along with expected contenders like "The Artist," "War Horse," "The Descendants," "The Help," and "Hugo" were two minor ersatz contenders that were expected to get some serious attention: "Moonlight" and "The Wolf of Wall Street."The awards are one of the most highly anticipated in Los Angeles this year, with so many nominees and several major contenders for the prize of the evening.The Producers Guild of America announced its nominees for the 10th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards on Wednesday night, and along with expected contenders like "The Artist," "The Descendants," "The War Horse," "The Wolf of Wall Street," "The Help," "Her" and "Hugo," were two minor ersatz contenders that were expected to get some serious attention: "Moonlight" and "The Wolf of Wall Street."Nominations were announced at the Los Angeles Film Festival, during an exclusive press conference attended by PGA Awards hosts, producers and critics, who noted that they hoped the Academy would continue to honor the best films.While PGA Chief Executive Officer Tom Sherak said he was proud that the organization had "a very high number of nominations, and we felt that this was a strong year for all films," he also said that while film critics have been the most important of the three pillars of the Academy Awards, there are still issues that need to be addressed. "There is work that needs to be done in the voting process," he said. "What is our process for nominating films and who are the ones that influence the process? So there are things we want to work, work on, and want to do better."While PGA officials did not mention specific changes that could be made to the nominating and voting process, Sherak said that they "want to work as well as we can" and hope to have a better dialogue with people at the Oscars and the producers. However, Sherak added that "if we don't work together, if we don't make the producers part of the process - I mean, you guys are important to the process - we will not be able to make a significant improvement to the process. And if we don't understand the problem that is happening, we will not have the ability to fix it."The PGA	0
Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m. The 26-year-old finalized his protracted move on Monday after agreeing Â£12m ($17.6m) with manager Carlo Ancelotti.Cahill, who won three England caps before the age of 24, made his full international debut against Serbia at San Siro on November 8, 2007. He made his second appearance against Greece the following night. He made a total of eight international appearances in the 2008-09 season.In 2005-06 he returned to Bolton Wanderers after winning two championships with Liverpool, and spent a further four seasons with them.He has started over 100 games for Bolton and helped them reach the League Cup final each season he played there.“I’m excited to be joining Chelsea and to be able to sign an agreement to stay,” Cahill said in a statement.“I believe this is the place to be and I’m going to work hard to get into the squad and play in the team I’ve always dreamed of playing in. It’s a dream come true for me and everyone in my family.”Chelsea said in a statement that they were “pleased to have reached an agreement to bring Gary Cahill to the club and wish the defender all the best for the future”. In the same statement, they also expressed their gratitude to Bolton in the process. “We’re delighted to have completed this deal to bring another one of our English internationals to Stamford Bridge,” chairman Bruce Buck said. “We have worked tirelessly with the player throughout the course of the last few months, both on and off the pitch.“This deal will allow us to bring another key member of our squad into the club.“We are delighted to have overcome the significant hurdles that we undertook with Bolton Wanderers and now we look forward to working together as a united team.”Bolton, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, finished the day one place (2 points) and 17 points (21 points) behind the same Chelsea side on August 1.Cahill, now back in the UK after winning over 100 England caps during his playing career, joined Bolton from	0
Authorities dropped a mandatory evacuation order Sunday for neighborhoods threatened by a strained lock on a southeast Louisiana canal, but still recommended people stay away. "As there is still a potential threat, even though reduced, a  safe and orderly evacuation of the New Orleans area remains important," said an afternoon statement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "The decision to impose mandatory evacuations for certain areas of New Orleans has been made."But a key state agency said the evacuation order was still necessary. The National Weather Service said that heavy rainfall, along with a crack in the concrete cap separating water from an underground canal, could leave New Orleans without a safe way to drain the floodwaters.By Sunday afternoon, the water level in Atchafalaya Basin had climbed to 6 feet, said meteorologist Bill Hager.Another area, called the Cajon River, already was filled with water, officials said, leading to the evacuation of a large area south of the city, where levees could not withstand further damage from the rising water.The floodwater continues to rise after Hurricane Gustav in September 2010, leaving many houses in N.O. without water for more than 20 days. (John P. Leger / Los Angeles Times)U-Haul has offered to store stranded residents in its truck and trailer park. Others are moving on foot. (Jason Dearen / Associated Press)One woman drove to a Louisiana storage facility to give her belongings to a U-Haul store. She left behind her furniture, dishes and video equipment. The store agreed to store what was left of her belongings for free. The woman, who didn't want to identify herself, said she was "trying to stay afloat.""I had to leave almost everything for the kids. That was my best chance for them to have some things," she said in a telephone interview from Dallas County, where she's staying with relatives.She said the floodwaters had come into her home's backyard and destroyed her yard. Her family is now at an evacuation center. She said her landlord had asked her to find another place to live."It's heartbreaking," she said. "We've lost everything. Now it's going to be up to the bank to decide if we're going to put our home on the market or not."A woman watches the rising water at her home in New Orleans	0
If he had been listening from his car Monday morning, radio veteran Steak Shapiro knew what he would have thought of a bit mocking a former New Orleans Saint now battling Lou Gehrig's disease. "I would have been offended." Why? The now former host of "Mayhem in the AM" on Atlanta's 790 The Zone offered up plenty of reasons in an interview Tuesday with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. And none of his descriptions of the now infamous two-minute radio bit were positive. Stupid. Not thought out. Offensive. Awful. And not funny. "You walk a fine line trying to be somewhat on the edge," Shapiro said. "We blew it. We blew it in a huge way." Shapiro and the show's two other hosts -- Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini -- were fired Monday evening. It all started, he explained, as the show's crew batted around ideas during a commercial break. The Atlanta Falcons are big in Georgia, and the New Orleans Saints are likely their biggest rivals. And it just so happened that Gleason, one of the men most associated with the Louisiana team, had been the guest writer for Peter King's popular "Monday Morning Quarterback" column this week on SI.com. But Gleason isn't just any Saint. He's a hero in New Orleans not just for his play as a defensive back but, more recently, for his battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neuromuscular disease also known by its acronym ALS and as Lou Gehrig's disease. The illness has hindered many of Gleason's functions, but it hasn't stopped him. To put together the column, he pointed out, he used technology that allowed him to type with his eyes. Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease. "ALS prevents your brain from talking to your muscles. As a result, muscles die. As a result, every 90 minutes people die," he wrote. "I am a person." The "Mayhem in the AM" crew decided to spoof Gleason's illness, specifically, the fact he speaks with a synthetic voice. The segment featured punchlines of an imaginary Gleason telling knock-knock jokes, using a would-be synthesizer, with punchlines like "Smother me, do me a favor."	1
A suspected leader of the Juarez drug cartel told authorities he had ordered the deaths of about 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said Sunday. Federal police detailed accusations against Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, known as "El Diego," a day after authorities announced his capture. He was one of the country's most wanted criminals, with officials offering a reward of 15 million pesos ($1.3 million) for his arrest. Collaboration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration led to Acosta's detention, said Eduardo Pequeno, head of the Mexican federal police anti-drug unit. Acosta is accused of being a leader of the drug gang known as La Linea, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, Mexican authorities have said. Pequeno told reporters that Acosta "said he ordered the killings of about 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua's capital." An investigation points to Acosta as the mastermind behind the March 2010 killing of three people connected with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said. More recently, Acosta ordered operatives to hang banners with threatening messages directed at the DEA and other U.S. authorities, Pequeno said. Juarez, Mexico's most violent city, shares a border with El Paso, Texas. Pequeno also accused Acosta of having connections with some of the border city's most notorious violence over the past two years, including the 2010 killing of a state prosecutor, a car bombing outside a police station and a massacre at a house party that killed 15 people -- most of them students with no ties to organized crime. Acosta told authorities the targets of his criminal organization included police, government officials, rival drug gangs and civilians, Pequeno told reporters. Earlier this month, the U.S. consulate in Juarez issued a statement warning "American citizens to remain vigilant" based on information it had received that cartels may target the consulate or entry points on the U.S.-Mexico border. The northwestern Mexican state of Chihuahua, which contains the namesake capital city as well as Juarez, has been a hotbed for drug-related violence. The federal government has been targeting cartels' operations, and especially its leaders, in an ongoing battle. Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to the slayings of three people connected with the consulate last year.	1

A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving. "Most Americans think that we've solved the problem of impaired driving, but in fact, it's still a national epidemic," NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. The idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the United States. NTSB looks to technology to end drunken driving in the U.S. Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy. But she said too many people are still dying on America's roads. The board acknowledged that there was "no silver bullet," but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels. "In the last 30 years, more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol-impaired driving. What will be our legacy 30 years from now?" Hersman asked. "If we don't tackle alcohol-impaired driving now, when will we find the will to do so?" Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board  said. Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma. That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator. Supreme Court rules against police in drunk driving case Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues. It cannot impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.	1
Real Madrid came from behind to beat cross-city rivals Atletico 3-1 in the first leg of their Copa Del Rey quarterfinal tie at the Santiago Arena in Madrid.The first half was a relatively quiet affair, with neither side going on a sustained run. At the half-hour mark, Atletico looked to be on the brink of scoring a goal in the face of a challenge from Fernando Madrid, but the unmarked striker failed to get his first-time effort on target and the visitors, who had dominated so far, were able to pull even.The home side then dominated through the second half, with Cristiano Ronaldo being directly involved in five of the seven goals.Madrid’s goals came in the 17th and 23rd minutes, with two set-pieces in the first half meaning only one of the two could be counted in the official match report.The home side had dominated most of the first half and looked to have secured a memorable victory with seconds to spare in the game as Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo completed their impressive double.The visitors, however, looked to have turned the tie around in the second half as a number of fine goals from Neymar and Angel Di Maria turned victory in their team’s favour.On match day, Atletico drew Barcelona 2-2 in a thrilling encounter in Madrid. Barcelona then beat Atlético Madrid by the same scoreline in the second leg.The first half began in exactly the same way as the last, with neither side attempting to take control of the match. Both squads could do little to affect each other on either side, with Ronaldo being the only noticeable player in either team as the first half finished.At the half-hour mark, Atletico looked to have scored a goal, having been awarded a penalty just as he was about to score at the feet of Ronaldo, but he couldn’t get the rebound on target and the visitors still managed to stay in the game.At the break, the only real activity on either side was that of the referee, with both teams remaining relatively quiet and just taking care of the business at hand. At the break, Real Madrid were 1-1.The second half began with a goal as Di Maria headed home a cross from Neymar in the 52nd minute.In the 57th minute, Zinedine Zidane�	0
Editor's note: Meloney Dunning, this year's Real Simple "Life Lessons Essay Contest" winner, describes the heartbreaking day when she decided to say good-bye to her newborn son, who urn.org first reported as dead when he was found after his mother collapsed in agony. To say the least, the decision put her in tears.I have always had a real affection for babies. They were my baby dolls who took up much less space than they did real babies, and they were perfect to bring a smile to my face and a smile to yours. I think a baby has given me a lot more joy than a lot of adults that I knew.Baby books and toys of all kinds were my favorites, and they would sit close to the bed and I’d hold them and sing to them, and sometimes I’d sing to them alone. It was my way of connecting with my family and I guess it just kept me from feeling like I was alone in a big bad world, but I don’t know how or why that happened. Maybe it was the music of my life.I think my baby books were the best thing a baby could ever have. It was a lot of fun putting together my own baby books. It was really neat that you had to have a baby’s first birthday to be able to complete the book. You could have one that was given to you and you could create your own. I thought that was really neat and it was always fun to look forward to the day when I had to add a name.My husband and I had a lot of conversations about the names of our children and sometimes we would argue about them because it was hard to name our own children yet we loved them so much. I can remember that the only time we would ever have to “end it” was if we said our baby wasn’t a boy or a girl the way we had planned for them when we were children.He would always say, “Mel, I love ya and I don’t want to argue, but I just think when it’s so small and you are trying to figure out what you want to name it, that it’s hard to choose something.” And I’d say, “Well, I don’t really know.” He’d always have	0
Celebrities are no strangers to charity work: Bono created his ONE campaign to fight global poverty, Angelina Jolie travels the world as a United Nations good will ambassador, and the recently named "Sexiest Man Alive" Bradley Cooper reportedly donated thousands of dollars worth of winter clothing to homeless people in Philadelphia, where he's filming his latest movie. Is this all part of keeping up appearances in image-centric Hollywood, or do most celebrities have a genuine desire to use their star status to help raise money or awareness for certain causes? Todd Krim, who founded Give Back Hollywood -- which helps connect celebrities and charities -- says he thinks there's a true desire by celebrities to get involved. "Maybe sometimes people might think it's a good idea (for a celebrity's image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest," Krim said. "In fact, there (are) a lot of celebrities who do charity work who don't even want cameras around." Krim spoke to CNN about why he started the organization and whether "young Hollywood" has embraced charity and grass roots causes: CNN: What inspired you to create Give Back Hollywood and what exactly does this organization do? Todd Krim: I really just fell into it. I'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 I met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but didn't know how ... I met Harry (Shum Jr. from "Glee") at an event, and I asked him, 'What charities or causes do you support?' (and) he said he didn't have one charity he works closely with. Because he's a dancer, I thought he'd connect with the Andrea Rizzo Foundation (which helps children with cancer through dance therapy). Long story short, he went to Mattel Children's Hospital (in Los Angeles) and participated in a dance therapy session. CNN: Do you think most celebrities get involved with charity as part of marketing their overall image? Or is there more of a genuine desire to use their star status to raise awareness for those in need?	1
The world now knows that the remains of Richard III -- the final Plantagenet king of England who fell at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- were under a parking lot. By most accounts, the dead monarch's corpse was iced over before being put in a car trunk at a roadside dump.In this post, we'll use the same site on the Web to examine a different mystery in the same area, albeit one that has been linked with a somewhat different story.In 2005, authorities had been looking for the body of a young girl whose disappearance had spooked many in the city's affluent community. So many people were asking questions that the police eventually decided to investigate the case as a missing person case, and began looking in the parking lot, where the remains were now believed to be. But while the cops were making progress this year, the bones were no longer there.The following year, police revisited that parking lot and found a mass of bones, which they confirmed as those of the same girl missing in August 2005.The news of the discovery stunned the Internet, with some commenters saying that the bones looked like those of Richard III and that the story of how they had ended up there was a macabre puzzle. The story caught the attention of another Web giant with a particular interest in the dark side of the internet, the British TV program "House of Cards:""I found this story on the BBC news website," said the show's executive producer, Richard Whiteley, in a YouTube video he released. "I was fascinated because I thought why was the remains of a young girl so important that they were looking there? That is, I thought they were looking for a body. Well obviously it's a body. It is a body."Why might the authorities be looking for the remains of a girl who happened to end up in the parking lot where Richard III's remains were found in 2005?In the case of Richard III, the most popular of the three scenarios that have been proposed involves a conspiracy: that there was some other reason for the authorities to be searching the parking lot. The conspiracy theory has received support from conspiracy theorists who believe that the bones were planted there -- not that the authorities had any real idea where they might be looking for the body.The other theories are more straightforward: that the bones belong to a young girl whose remains were in the parking lot, and that	0
Pope Benedict XVI made one of his strongest statements to date on the sex abuse scandal sweeping the Roman Catholic Church, saying he had given "his life" in service to the Church.He is expected to speak at this weekend's papal visit to Ireland where he will be received by Pope John Paul II in St. Patrick's Day service."I live my life not to make but to give" Benedict said during a visit to the Vatican in the presence of a small group of senior Vatican officials including Secretary of State Georg Ganswein and Archbishop of Vienna Hans Joachim Meisner.Benedict XVI's comments were made during a meeting that included two Irish Vatican officials as well as the Vatican's diplomatic chief in Rome, Monsignor Luigi Di Maio.Benedict XVI had been invited to Ireland by the Vatican's chief ethics officer to address the sex abuse scandal there.Benedict XVI will be received in St. Patrick's Day services by Pope John Paul II on SaturdayMeisner described the visit as a "courageous and exceptional" visit and described the Pontiff as having been "most humble and approachable, affable and in a very gentle manner."Benedict XVI's address will be addressed to a gathering of Irish bishops at a service at the Irish Parliament in Dublin, an event the pontiff is expected to attend as well.Ireland's Cardinal John D'Aloisio, the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the man who introduced the pontiff to the Irish people as a "magnificent surprise," said: "I am sure I am ready to say more or less what Pope Benedict XVI has said."He expressed full agreement with my statement that the sex abuse scandal undermines the foundations of the Church, the unity and the unity of the Church."He also said that the scandal has also shaken the spirit of the people of Ireland - that we are in a very serious crisis."I think that is true and I think that is a very good point."Pope John Paul II is scheduled to make an open-air statement from the balcony of St. Mary's Hospital in Sligo when the pontiff arrives in Dublin on Saturday morning.John Paul will then make an address to the crowd before departing for Rome.On Saturday, Pope Benedict XVI will be	0
A white tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park Wednesday as a group of tourists watched in horror, police say. The zookeeper Â was attacked by the animal after entering her enclosure and attempting to rescue an animal stuck deep in the undergrowth.Police were called to the Taranaki Wildlife Park in the town of Hawera, near Auckland, at 4 a.m. local time. The park had closed until further notice after the incident.A man who was in the middle of the enclosure had watched the assault and tried to rescue the animal, police said.According to TV One, the incident happened in a large enclosure filled with exotic animals, including lions, tigers, bears and cheetahs.The park says that a group of five people, including a zookeeper who was in the enclosure, were alerted to the tiger’s attack when they witnessed the tiger take the zookeeper’s arm out of its mouth.Taranaki Police said the tiger charged the zookeeper and began mauling her, while others held it back.It said the tiger then turned its attention to several children who had come to visit the park, but were far from the enclosure.“The animal then left the area, went onto the grounds and started to chase another young child around the grounds and attempted to eat the victim,” police said.“The victim was able to escape and then alerted a number of people before she collapsed.”Zoo director Michael Schofield said he believed the animal was acting protectively, which has left the park in shock and shock.“I am in complete shock,” he said. “I know it is an animal that is not indigenous to New Zealand and I can only assume that it is a large male tiger. I was just hoping it would have been under a guard, or in a cage, and not attacking and mauling a person.”Schofield said the animal could have been in the area for days and that his main hope was that the victim was able to catch a ride back to her home before she died.“I am really hoping this poor girl is well to go back home,” Schofield said. “I was hoping to just get her back to the	0
One of the most cosmopolitan cities in Africa, Johannesburg is multicultural and multifaceted. Make the most of your time there with these tips. The Apartheid Museum is an often disturbing view of South Africa's troubled past. Apartheid Museum It's a disturbing experience, but a visit to Apartheid Museum is essential if you want to understand the city's troubled past. On arrival, visitors are randomly allocated a pass labeling them as white or non-white, referencing the apartheid pass laws that obliged black South Africans to carry identity passes at all times. Harrowing multimedia displays and news footage recreate the brutality of the apartheid era, while nooses hanging from the ceiling represent the political prisoners executed under the system.

the former rising star of the ruling Communist Party who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- to life in prison Sunday. Bo received the life sentence for bribe-taking, as well as 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. The sentences, which came shortly after the guilty verdicts, surprised some analysts. "I'm actually a little bit surprised. I think it's a very strong verdict" compared to some previous cases, said Yuhua Wang, a political science professor at University of Pennsylvania. "He was a political star before falling from grace. He was ... the son of a revolutionary veteran. His father was Mao's colleague," he added. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days last month, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events. 'I can bear the suffering' Days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict, Bo reiterated his innocence but said he anticipated a lengthy imprisonment in a letter written to his family. "I was dragged into this and really wronged, but the truth will come out one day," wrote Bo in a letter dated September 12, referring to the bribes allegedly taken by his wife and other scandals involving her and her friends. Read more: Five big moments from the trial "Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison," Bo continued. "Dad was thrown into prison multiple times in his lifetime and I will look up to him as my role model." Bo's late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. During the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966, however, the senior Bo was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned for over a decade. He was "rehabilitated" in 1979 and became one of the most influential senior politicians under Deng. "Dad and Mom have passed away, but their teachings are deeply ingrained in my mind," Bo wrote. "I will never bring disgrace to them and their glory. I can bear the suffering no matter how great it is.	1
Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said. Palestinians distribute U.N. food aid Thursday in a refugee camp in southern Gaza. The U.N. has "lost confidence" in the Israeli military's attempts to allow humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency's director said. Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council late Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Fourteen of the council's 15 members voted in favor of the resolution -- with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice abstaining from the vote. Hours before the resolution was approved, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanded an investigation into the convoy incident he said killed two contract workers near the Israel-Gaza border. UNRWA director John Ging said one aid worker was killed. Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.  Images emerge of Israeli troops in Gaza » "We are perfectly willing to take risks, but something has to change," Ging told reporters from Gaza City. "If they give us the clearance to move, it is [unacceptable] that their soldiers are firing on us from the ground." Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle. Four U.N. staffers have been killed since Israeli airstrikes on Gaza began December 27, and two U.N. schools in the territory used as civilian shelters have also been hit by the Israeli military. The aid agency provides food and relief supplies to some 80 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million people, but it says it has been unable to reach many Palestinians or assess the situation in Gaza during the Israeli military offensive. The absence of foreign journalists -- whom Israel has barred from entering Gaza -- is preventing the truth about conditions there from getting out, Ging said. "We have horrific stories coming out now. ... You have to brace yourself for more," Ging said. "This is a horrific situation."	1
China will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, bow out. In the post-Mao era, Chinese leadership change and power transition have become institutionalized and more predictable.  ---|---  **What causes power transitions?**  The three most commonly identified causes of power transitions are the following:  * _Losing a contest to an insurgent party_ —When an insurgent party overtakes one major political party in a contest for power, the party that has lost is the winner, and the contest ends.  ---|---  **What is an insurgent party?**  When a party is defeated in a contest among its own members, the party's members become members of an insurgent party. In the United States, the term "insurgent party" refers to the Democratic Party of the United States (DPUSA) and its allies in the Republican Party and other progressive and liberal parties.  **Who are the insurgents?**  The most famous insurgent party in the USA is the DPUSA. Its members are known as Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) in the USA; Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) in the UK; and Democratic Socialists in Ireland (DSI).  **Why are insurgents successful?**  In the eyes of its insurgent supporters, the Democratic party is too far left and corrupt. So, they are willing to take a risk by challenging the party's leadership in a contest for power. To become successful insurgents, a party needs to develop an active network of supporters and to use "voter-power" to help gain the support of working-class people.  **How do the insurgents win the support of voters?**  The most important and difficult step to become successful insurgents is to convince voters to support them. To be considered by voters as "acceptable," the insurgents first need to make their party acceptable to voters. To do that, the insurgents first have to win the support of working-class people in an election and then they have to convince them that they are the "next best thing." To win the support of working-class people, the party has to gain the support of influential business-people. To win the support of business-people, to establish a consensus among them, and to be considered	0
Mother Nature showed her extremes across the United States on Tuesday, with another day of dangerously hot temperatures broiling the Southwest while parts of the Northeast grapple with flooding from torrential storms. Temperatures iced in the Midwest Tuesday evening as another round of snow fell in the Chicago area.But there’s a lot more to be said about this week’s scorching heat outside, especially as the U.S. braces for another week of drought. That drought, which has resulted in wildfires this year in California and more than a quarter of the total acreage burned so far this year — a record — was also the topic of a conference call with top government officials called in light of the fires, with a focus on the National Weather Service’s role in spotting and responding to hazards like the drought.The nation’s top weather forecasters are worried about the drought, which threatens an estimated 15 million acres of cropland, but most have called for an end to it.“We’re worried about crop loss,” according to a National Weather Service representative, which is why several officials have focused on how the severe heat is affecting the drought’s impact on food and energy supplies.This week alone, the drought has seen three of the most destructive wildfires seen this year in California, and is only projected to get worse, according to an analysis by Reuters from the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is based on observations by weather stations across the country.The drought that began in January has had an impact on fire activity so far this year, Reuters reported:The drought also has affected crop production, with the lack of rain leading to early planting and limited moisture for corn in the first half of the growing season, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. (The corn is also used to produce ethanol, with its production linked to fossil fuels, according to the Drought Monitor.)“If this drought continues, it could reduce crop insurance and make it even more difficult for farmers to repay money taken out to adjust to its effects,” according to a report by Reuters.To read the full Reuters story, please click here.

Republicans who pressed President Barack Obama for a more coordinated federal response to the Ebola outbreak are blasting the appointment of Ron Klain, a veteran Democratic political aide, as the "Ebola czar." "This appointment is both shocking and izrashic," said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), "What this means is that we're turning over this emergency to somebody who's had no experience with this disease and very little understanding of the need to act at the local, state and federal level to prevent an outbreak."The Republican-controlled Senate voted down a resolution to grant the presidency emergency powers to deal with the outbreak, saying the resolution was too broad and that it could create dangerous precedent.ADVERTISEMENTThe White House said in a statement Monday night that the Klain will head the federal response, and the public health chief in charge of the outbreak, Dr. Tom Frieden, said the same Monday.”Dr. Tom Frieden, the president’s chief health and medical advisor, said it’s his job to be the “coordinator of all our public health activities," a position he said should be filled by the president,” the White House official said.” Klain would only have to report to Frieden, who would head up the response "to make sure that all efforts are coordinated," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said later Monday. Klain "will take a lead on coordinating all public health measures, including coordinating with Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and working with the nation’s governors and state and local partners," the White House official said. In a statement, Klain said his "new role as the public health official in charge of ensuring we have the most coordinated and effective response to this horrific epidemic is an honor and a great responsibility." He called the Ebola outbreak "a public health emergency" and praised his "commitment to public health and our commitment to the health and safety of all Americans." Klain, a Harvard Business School professor and former top aide to U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.), served for more than two years as a deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton. He also worked in the Clinton administration on public health programs for the National Rural Housing Coalition and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Finance Corporation.

White House officials have pressured insurance industry executives to keep quiet amid mounting criticism over Obamacare's rollout, insurance industry sources told CNN. Sebelius: 'I apologize, I'm accountable' for Obamacare website flaws After insurance officials publicly criticized the implementation, White House staffers contacted insurers to express their displeasure, industry insiders said. Multiple sources declined to speak publicly about the push back because they fear retribution. But Bob Laszewski, who heads a consulting firm for big insurance companies, did talk on the record. "The White House is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet," he said. Laszewski, who's been a vocal critic of Obamacare, said he's been asked by insurance executives to speak out because they feel defenseless against an administration that is regulating their business -- and a big customer. Government-backed plans accounted for about half of health care policies last year, a number that is expected to grow over the years. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the idea that administration officials are trying to silence insurance industry insiders is "preposterous and inaccurate." He added that Laszewski has been a vocal critic of health care reform for two decades. "Plus, it ignores the fact that every day insurance companies are out talking about the law  -- in large part because they are trying to reach millions of new customers who will now have new affordable insurance options available from providers through the new Market Places," Carney said. Obama and his top advisers have acknowledged problems with the health care website. On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the latest administration official to apologize for the bungled rollout. Yet she and other officials continue to argue that once they are fully up and running, the insurance exchanges will benefit Americans. But Obama also has been accused of breaking his promise that people who like their current plans can keep them. Insurers have begun discontinuing policies that don't meet Obamacare's beefed up coverage requirements. Laszewski said insurance company officials are embarrassed that they have to cancel plans and force people into more robust, and possibly more expensive, coverage. Keep your plan? Maybe not Insurers, he said, warned the White House that the regulations would lead to discontinued policies. "One of the things I think is clear here is the Obama administration has no trust in anything the health insurance industry is telling them about how to run a health plan," Laszewski said. 5 things we learned from Tuesday's Obamacare hearing	1
Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen's interior minister and a rebel official said. That news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after Yemen's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him. Nine people were killed and 67 others injured iin the clashes, Yemen's Health Ministry said. The Yemeni government, a U.S. ally in the battle against al Qaeda, described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as Houthis, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country. Turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the West because a power vacuum in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris; it also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. A Houthi delegate, Ali Daghshan, told CNN that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations. Interior Minister Jalal Al Rowaishan also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached. There are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes. Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis. Houthis say Yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in Sanaa a few days ago. A Western diplomat in Sanaa told CNN the situation was complex. "Today's events appear to be the next stage in Houthi plans to extend their control in Yemen. But there are many players with many agendas. So this hasn't finished playing out," the diplomat said. It is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace Monday. Control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country. There were reports of government buildings, a hospital and residential buildings being hit. The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday. Both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed, which is expected to happen Tuesday, said the official. The Yemeni information minister told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that government control is "almost nonexistent."	1
Police in the Pakistani city of Karachi have opened a murder case against the owner of a garment factory where a fire killed more than 250 people this week, a senior police official said Thursday. Also under investigation in the case are a local official and a provincial government representative.On Thursday, police detained the owner and the local official, Abdul Rehman Chohan, as well as a provincial government representative, Khalid Mehmood, for questioning in the blaze that killed at least 250 people on Tuesday.Mr. Chohan is the brother of the factory's owner, Muhammad Ishaq Chohan, who was taken into police custody Tuesday in connection with the blaze."They are being questioned for the time being, but investigation is ongoing," Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a spokesman for Sindh's Sui Northern police, told Reuters.A day earlier, police arrested Mr. Mehmood, a member of the provincial government, and his brother, the provincial Sindh's civil surgeon, Dr. Khalid Mehmood, for allegedly facilitating illegal activities at the factory owned by Mr. Chohan on the outskirts of Karachi, officials said.The factory has been producing high-quality clothing for export, and the police, acting on information received on Tuesday, raided the complex on Monday afternoon. There were no reports of any problems at the time.The two men were later released. Police have arrested Muhammad Ishaq Chohan on Wednesday. His family, who were in the city to collect the victim's belongings from the factory, said on Thursday that he was being questioned and should be released soonA senior police official confirmed the arrests, and said they were suspected of facilitating illegal activities at the factory and the blaze.The senior police official said the case was being investigated by Sindh's Police Services, and that the police did not receive any complaints from the victims' relatives against the owner of the factory.According to Sindh's Sui Northern police spokesman, the fire occurred when a worker lit incense sticks to burn charcoal to produce smoke, causing the charcoal to produce fire-retardant powder and starting a massive fire.The official said the factory and the surrounding areas are known for their factories of illegal charcoal and are known to produce charcoal that is prone to fire.In response to the deaths on Wednesday, the Sindh government offered to pay compensation to the	0
No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection. McGuire, 53, was convicted in 1994 for the rape and murder of 22-year-old Joy Stewart, who was seven months pregnant. He was executed Thursday morning at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville with an injection of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, an analgesic. Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson witnessed the event, his 19th. "This one was different," he said in a posting on the newspaper's website. "After three to four minutes, Dennis McGuire began gasping for breath, his stomach and chest were compressing deeply, he was making a snorting sound, almost a choking sound at times. "And I didn't notice it at first, but his left hand -- which had been waving at his kids -- had clenched into a fist." For about 10 minutes, McGuire appeared to be straining against his restraints, Johnson recalled. "Obviously, he couldn't get up, but he appeared to be trying to get up or at least raise up in some fashion." Such a response should never have happened, according to Jon Paul Rion, a lawyer representing the killer's family. McGuire's children, Dennis Ray McGuire and Amber McGuire, were among the witnesses. Controversial execution in Ohio uses new drug combination "Before the execution, there was a series of experts who testified in federal court that this is a possible to likely outcome to that procedure," Rion told reporters. He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. "The family will be satisfied if this process stops," Rion said. "That is their goal."	1
Abu Ali is 58 years old. He could be 78, his beard gray, body frail and his face a leathery road map that traces the unimaginable horrors his family has endured. It is a face that reflects a visceral human portrait of the grinding violence in Iraq and the toll it has taken on ordinary civilians. The al-Jibouri family are not politicians, nor insurgents, nor religious radicals. They are -- or used to be -- a family of humble watermelon sellers, plying their trade with plump fruit from Mosul in their stall, barely 50 meters from their home in Baghdad. Their descent into hell began on July 23, 2007. Their son Ali -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of Baghdad's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area. He was killed instantly. "I was a week away from marrying him off," Abu Ali sobs. "Instead I buried him." Abu Ali doesn't stop crying the entire time we are with the family. Eight thousand Iraqis died last year, according to the U.N. Iraq Body Count lists 640 civilian deaths so far in January. But numbers are anonymous and cold: to visit the al-Jibouri family is to see and feel and be suffocated by the human reality of those statistics. As the politicians play politics, and the insurgents deal in death, it is people like this who suffer the fallout, as they always do in war. Ali's devastated fiance Duaa later married Ali's brother Alaa. Together they had three children: a son, also called Ali, now aged three, and daughters Rukkaya, four, and Narjis, eight months. In July last year the family was preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Najaf, where Ali is buried, to honor his memory. It was July 20, a Saturday, and Alaa and brother Abbas were on duty at the water melon stand. Everyone heard the bomb inside the family home. It rocked the walls and shook the ground. Alaa, 23, and Abbas, 17, were blown to pieces, along with several other people. Today, the walls by the old watermelon stand are scarred by shrapnel. Abu Ali has now lost all three sons. "No one will call me dad anymore," he wails.	1
On most mornings, my better half wakes up around 5:30, throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work. About a half hour later, I wake up my 13-year-old son, go downstairs to the kitchen to make his breakfast and  have a cup of coffee while I shower – we never get enough time in the mornings. The same goes for eating out, especially Italian food. Sometimes, I’ll have to leave him to run upstairs to the kitchen and get a couple of minutes for a quick bite but more often than not, we end up arguing about it and he’ll end up coming back down to eat with me. We both know how hungry we are and we know how much we’re going to eat at restaurants – which is why we try to order pizza at restaurants and grab a couple of slices out for ourselves because it’s all too easy to grab whatever is on the menu to order. So I don’t really understand what’s wrong about the concept of ordering a pizza and then eating a slice for yourself. However, I’ve never understood the argument against eating a plate of cheese, mushrooms and tomato sauce for myself on my way to a restaurant. The same goes for other foods, whether or not they’re “healthy”. You could argue that you should be eating a healthy plate of food if you’re going to be eating out for most of the week. And yet, if you have a choice to eat out, you will eventually get tired of the “healthy option” – you will eat pasta with a salad, pizza with salad and so on. So, I guess I understand the appeal of eating out. You get to eat what you want and when you want because you don’t have to sit down and eat a boring, heavy dinner at 6 p.m. I get it. That’s why I’ve never understood the concept of ordering a salad for myself on the way to a restaurant. But I think that’s the part of the argument that has always gotten to me the most. I think that if you ordered a salad for yourself during the week, would you really order a salad for yourself during the week? I’m not kidding – I don’t think so. I think that I’d eat whatever was on the menu and if I were a really	0
The case of a Georgia woman, whose execution was postponed for a second time Monday, is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face: When do we put our own citizens to death? But it's an issue on which this country is all over the place. "As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."  That was Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008). You might think at first the Department of Justice isn't listening. After all, the U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death, and not all of them involve a victim's life being taken.  They fall into three main categories: 1) homicide offenses; 2) espionage and treason; and 3) nonhomicidal narcotics offenses.  While most of them involve the death of a victim, not all of them do. But what happened to all that "shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken" language from the Supreme Court?  Doesn't the Department of Justice have to listen to the Supreme Court? They do, and they have. The Department of Justice has read the high court's fine print in Kennedy v. Louisiana:  "Our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons. We do not address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State. As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken." Ah.  As with most things, there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions. Apparently, when we are talking about crimes against people, the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide-type crimes.  If it's a crime against the state, well, it's game on.	1
Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is heading to North Carolina next week to campaign with Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis, CNN has learned. This comes as GOP officials believe Tillis, the North Carolina Republican for Senate, is in a stronger position to win a hotly contested runoff against Tillis’s Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. Romney was a close Romney supporter who lost the 2012 GOP presidential nomination to President Obama. As a business executive, Romney made his fortune building companies in Massachusetts and later served in the Cabinet of former President Ronald Reagan. He served as Massachusetts’s governor from 2001 until 2003. Romney and his wife, Ann, have three children. The GOP senatorial runoff between Tillis and Colbert Busch comes less than a month before the GOP-led Senate assumes control over the House and the White House after November’s elections. Tillis said he will remain on the campaign trail through the weekend, and if he wins the seat, he will not return to his office until after the Senate takes control over the House and the White House on January 3. Tillis’s campaign has already begun to make an aggressive push to highlight his close ties to the economy. Tillis was one of two Republican lawmakers to vote against Obama’s fiscal-cliff proposal earlier this year. If the GOP takes control of the Senate next week, they could pass legislation that cuts or eliminates the spending caps on defense and discretionary spending that were set to expire on January 2, 2013. Tillis’s comments to CNN indicate his candidacy has made him a favorite of the party’s conservative base following Romney’s loss to Obama. “I won’t be able to get there as quickly as I want to, but I’ve got as good a chance as anybody to make the Senate races competitive and make a difference in November,” Tillis said. “We’re going to get through this. And as I look over the course of time, the longer I’m on in this race or the more people that start to see Thom as the only option, that’s why I’m going to keep on going.” –CNN contributor Don Lemon	0
Qatar's government says it's investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working during a fire at an upscale Doha shopping mall that killed 19 people, most of them children in a nursery. The fatalities at the Villaggio shopping mall included seven girls, six boys, four teachers, and two other adults, the Persian Gulf monarchy's interior ministry said Monday. Rescuers were unable to reach the nursery from the inside and had to break into it from the rooftop, Health Minister Abdullah bin Khalid Al Qahtani told the state news agency QNA. The government has set up a committee to investigate "the causes and circumstances" of the blaze, QNA announced Monday night. The agency quoted Brig. Gen. Othman al-Duhaimi, the operations chief for Qatar's civil defense agency, as saying alarms went off in some shops, and that some of the pipes that carried water for the sprinklers may have been leaking -- and that those issues would be addressed in the investigation. Christine Wigton, an American living in Doha, told CNN she heard "a buzzer, not very loud" as she walked into the mall, but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside. Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape, she said. "When I got a little bit closer, I realized the smoke was just increasing and people were still shopping. And the smoke kept getting heavier and heavier," Wigton said. She said she left when the smoke became "too much." "There were no sprinklers, and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong," she said. Built in 2006, the mall advertises itself as "the newest and the largest entertainment center in Doha." The Venice-themed complex features gondola rides down an indoor canal, an artificial sky, a 13-screen movie theater, a theme park, skating rink and a bowling alley. Qatar's interior minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license. "The investigation will clarify all the circumstances of the incident and find out the shortcomings and question those who are responsible in order to tackle the matter in the future," he said in remarks carried by QNA.	1
Venezuela's authoritarian president Hugo Chavez is a villain out of a Batman movie: buffoonish and sinister in equal measure. Sunday's vote result powerfully exposes both sides of his clown-prince system of rule. Read more: Survivor Â â€œThe Venezuelan Electionâ€Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called on Venezuelans to vote for the opposition. But the country's opposition could end Chavez's four-and-a-half year iron-fisted rule with a stunning victory.By Dan Murphy and Patrick MarleyMarch 16, 2012This past week was defined by the drama that has been playing out in Venezuela. As Venezuelans took to the polls in a national referendum on Sunday, a new era of politics was set to begin. The voters, many of whom are new to democracy, found themselves with one of the most complicated ballot papers in all of Latin America.There the question was simple: which side are they on? More important, how will they vote?Voters have until 4 p.m. on March 20 to decide. But a record turnout of 80 percent of those casting early ballots showed no sign of abating."If I had to give a short description of what the day might look like tomorrow, I would say that you will have Venezuelan soccer players, Venezuelan politicians, and Venezuelans voting."The vote's result was a shock. An overwhelming vote of 73 percent voted for the "no" side, with only 25 percent voting for the "yes" side. This is the first time since the election of President Hugo Chavez in 1998 that the opposition has obtained the majority of the vote in a national referendum. That is not to say that Chavez and his party will be toppled by the opposition.The opposition is facing an uphill battle. They are facing a united front — and that was on display on Sunday. From Venezuela, the U.S.-backed opposition called for a "national and international strike" on Sunday. A massive rally was held at the Venezuelan embassy in Berlin."The Venezuelan workers of the National Bolivarian Movement (MNR) — a political party formed by the Venezuelan teachers and civil servants — called for national and international strikes to denounce Chavez’s economic strangulation of Venezuela," the opposition said in a statement."We are calling on the whole world to block Chavez’	0
Two months. It looks like it might be that long before a local grand jury decides whether to bring charges in the death of Michael Brown -- the loud, passionate calls for swift justice notwithstanding. The shooting of the African-American teenager by a urchin-armed, uniformed police officer who had been stalking him has left the country in an uproar of race and tension.But this should not surprise. As many as 8,000 cases file in the federal courts every year are dismissed without investigation, without even a public comment hearing. We are in a state of deep denial.These cases are dropped because the district attorney, in collusion with his or her political allies, choose not to bring charges. We know now that the police, for the most part, have a history of racist incidents and bias. After the acquittal of officers who killed Walter L. Scott, many saw this as the end of such incidents. But as it turns out, it was just the beginning.As I noted in my column last month, "Race Matters," our federal laws allow the federal government to sue for a wrongful arrest even though the arrest was justifiable under state law. As a result, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be wrongly arrested and more likely to be wrongfully convicted than whites.The numbers are even worse in death cases. For instance, in 2006, after Ferguson, the Department of Justice had a record 61 percent failure rate for bringing racial discrimination charges against police.Our justice system also is guilty of many other crimes against black and other minorities -- like voting rights, police use of force, use of excessive force and many things that have been swept under the rug. While these crimes, and the lack of support from the media, often are hidden, sometimes they are not, and they are often covered over by a cover-up of the truth that allows the perpetrators to walk free.The cover-up is one reason some people say the justice system does not work.The justice system works when people who have been wronged by injustice can find a private attorney/s and have someone representing them. That has not been possible in Ferguson and other communities because of race and class.This also is not a black and white issue, as many people seem to think. People are not uniform. They look like me and you. They look white and they look black. Many are blue and some are brown. Some	0
Hundreds of troops from Chad and Niger launched a ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria on Sunday, according to residents and military sources from Niger. The sweeping offensive is taking place along Ã¢ÂÂthe corridorÃ¢ÂÂ between Cameroon, Nigeria and Chad where extremists are holed up in more than a dozen towns, according to the Nigerian military. Ã¢ÂÂTheyÃ¢ÂÂre using women and children to advance,Ã¢ÂÂ a source with the Nigerian military told The Associated Press. Ã¢ÂÂThey are pushing towards us on the ground, and there is fighting going on now as we speak.Ã¢ÂÂMoussaoui: 'I have no regrets'A look at a man who has seen the destruction of his life and the aftermath of a life of crime.By: Andrew Burton, Special to CNNThe Associated Press -Jomhouri Péga, Mali (CNN) - His mother and a friend carried him by the hand up the hill to a cemetery. They came to visit a place where they believed their son would be buried.It was a Tuesday morning. The only time the crows flocked into Péga's house came at night, just after dusk and after all the children were asleep, their parents unable to hear them cawing in the darkness.Then, on this quiet spring morning, the crows came again and cawed for hours at the graves of Péga's mother and brother, their bodies being burned in the ritual of death.But on April 8 in this village in northern Mali, when he went to see, and later returned to the graves to watch the burning, Péga came to a different conclusion.He couldn't come up with any reason to say that he had something to be proud of.Péga may have seen a lot of things, but he doesn't think of his actions as bad.

including 10 slain during a shootout with soldiers, authorities said Friday. The shootout also resulted in the arrest of a senior government official, the State Department said.But he stressed that he did not see any evidence that Saudi Arabia was involved in any plot, and that he believed such an allegation came froma "political motive."He said that the U.S. delegation was ready to meet with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud "to talk about thesituation in Syria."The administration's review "does not mean that the U.S. government is taking a position on the matter in regards to who was responsible,"White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. "We have said all along that it is a matter that the United States wants to see resolved."The crown prince has denied Saudi involvement in the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama has repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia andordered the U.S. to cut ties with the country's intelligence organization as part of a broader U.S. response to what it called thedestruction of the Middle East's "peace process."But Earnest maintained that the U.S. delegation would meet with Saudi leaders to "work these things through."He said that the U.S. will continue to support the Syrian opposition in its fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But headded there was "no evidence" that Assad and his government were responsible for the attack on the U.S. embassy compound inDamascus.The attack has added to the pressure on the administration to step up the pressure on the Syrian government. U.S. Ambassador MarkReston said Thursday that the administration is considering more diplomatic and economic sanctions to punish Assad."We believe it's more than a matter of simply condemning Assad or doing nothing at all," White House spokesman Earnest said. "We'repursuing a range of potential response capabilities."He said the administration believes "there's not a single person or organization outside of Assad's government that could justify thisattack and be responsible for it."The U.N. Commission of Inquiry into the Syria chemical weapons episode said its investigation found no evidence to suggest thatAssad used the Syrian chemical weapons.While Earnest has stressed again that the U.S. is still reviewing its options, White House spokesman	0
There is no evidence to suggest that the two men who used stolen passports to get aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had anything to do with its disappearance Saturday as it was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, an official said Tuesday. "The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident," Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble told reporters Tuesday at his organization's headquarters in Lyon, France. Here's what we know about what happened, how it happened and why. WHO ARE THEY? The passengers are Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, and Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18. They entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports. CNN obtained an iReport photo of what appears to be the two men with two of their friends. Metadata from the photo indicates that it was shot with an iPhone at 8:20 p.m. the night before the plane departed. CNN has blurred the faces of the other two men to protect their identities. WHAT HAPPENED? To fly out of Malaysia, Reza and Nourmohammadi used passports that were stolen in Thailand, a booming market for stolen passports. The passports belonged to citizens of Italy and Austria. "Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality, false passports (which includes altered, stolen passports) and other supporting documentation," said Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years. The Italian, Luigi Maraldi, 37, told reporters he reported his passport stolen in August. The Austrian, Christian Kozel, 30, had his stolen in July 2013. Authorities said they don't know how Reza and Nourmohammadi came to possess the passports. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? On Saturday, Reza used the Italian's passport; Nourmohammadi used the Austrian's. According to Thai police, an Iranian man named Kazem Ali bought one-way tickets for the men, describing them as friends who wanted to return home to Europe. While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, Ali or someone acting on his behalf paid cash for the tickets, police said. The tickets were purchased at the same time from China Southern Airlines in Thailand's baht currency and at identical prices, according to China's official e-ticket verification system Travelsky. The ticket numbers are consecutive, implying they were issued together.	1
When Kyesha Smith Wood heard that her teen daughters were rude to another patron who asked them to be quiet at a local movie theater, she was furious. The Birmingham, Alabama, mom made them write urns and put them in the trash, before sending more than 100 letters threatening to sue the theater chain if the girls didn't return to see another film later that day."I wanted to make sure that they didn't do something like that again and I thought there would be consequences for it," said Wood, who lives in an area that is often criticized for its crime statistics and violent crime rate.Wood's actions became a story this week, when Kysha Smith — who wrote a petition against the theater after it received more than 1,200 online signatures — was interviewed on NBC's Today show on Friday to talk about what happened.Smith, who is pregnant with her first child and does not want to be identified, explained her reasons as she told NBC News:"I've seen movies with my kids and I've seen them get angry and they get loud and I want to ensure that that never happens again."Smith said she also felt her daughters deserved to see a movie, as she also lives in the area and has seen the theater that the girls were in on many occasions."I want my daughter to see movies, I want my son to watch movies, I want my little boys to go to a movie and I'm hoping that this is what was behind the incident," she told NBC.Wood told Today there was a movie at the time the girls were rude, but the young women told her it was not a good movie. The actress said the girls weren't rude, she merely thought it was an unnecessary inconvenience for the patrons, which Smith admitted."I got to where I was getting a little bit frustrated with both of them," said Wood. "They were very rude."Smith also admitted to NBC on Friday, that she has no desire to talk to the girls about the incident."I just don't want them to know about it. They need to figure it out themselves and they need to make their own decisions as far as their choice," Smith said.In the end, Wood apologized to the girls the next day for sending them hateful letters, which are now on display at her home. But she was also upset by the way	0
New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin arrived in Cuba late Friday on a mission to learn about how to deal with storms, a spokeswoman said. Mayor Ray Nagin watches President Obama speak in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday. "We understand we may have a lot to learn from the Cubans in terms of disaster preparedness and how they have dealt with hurricanes," spokeswoman Ceeon Quiett said. Cuba is internationally applauded for exceptional disaster management, according to a news release from Nagin's office. In the Cuban capital, Havana, Nagin plans to meet with several officials, including some from the Latin American Medical Centers for Disaster. He will also learn about preparations the Cuba Defense Committee makes in advance of disasters. Nagin's trip comes a day after President Obama held a town hall meeting in New Orleans, still reeling from the aftermath of deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005. "It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores," the president said. "And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared, and we didn't appropriately respond." Since Katrina, New Orleans has adjusted its disaster response with new evacuation plans. As Hurricane Gustav threatened the city last year, officials evacuated more than 18,000 residents, the release said. Three powerful hurricanes hit Cuba last year, damaging half a million homes and causing $10 billion in losses, according to the Cuban government. But only seven people died, thanks to a smooth evacuation plan. Some aspects of the communist nation's response, including mandatory evacuations, may not be possible in a democracy. Still, some Americans believe that they can learn from their Caribbean neighbor. The mayor of Galveston, Texas, another city hit hard by Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, visited Cuba this year. Nagin is the first New Orleans mayor to make an official visit to Cuba in 50 years. The State Department sanctioned Nagin's trip, Quiett said. He plans to return to New Orleans on Thursday. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.	1
The Israeli Military said Thursday that the "vast majority" of Palestinians killed in the recent Gaza conflict were "terror operatives" and the number of people killed was less than Palestinian sources reported. Israel says the majority of Palestinians killed in the recent Gaza conflict were terrorists.The IDF Spokesman's Office said in a statement issued late Thursday that the "vast majority" of Palestinians killed in the recent Gaza conflict were "terror operatives." The number of Palestinian casualties is less than the number that Israel's military sources reported, the military said.The army said that the number of Palestinians killed is lower than the Gazan population of 3.4 million.The number of Palestinians killed in the war were a fraction of those who were reported to have been killed, however. The Gaza Strip has a population of 3.4 million people. A total of 1,742 Palestinians have been killed by the IDF, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health website. Israel says that 1,100 were "terror operatives."The Palestinian Health Ministry and the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV put the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza more than double what Israel claimed, saying that the real number of Palestinian casualties could be as high as 3,000.The ministry also said that more than 2,000 Palestinians were injured in the conflict, according to the news channel's website. This is one of many numbers put out by the two sides.Palestinian militant organizations have put the number of deaths of Palestinians killed in the war at 4,000, but the IDF says it is only two percent of the Palestinian deaths. Israel's military says it was attacked by more than a dozen missiles from across the border, and the IDF says that terrorists fired the missiles."There was no real danger to Israel. The missiles which struck the territory were fired from a terrorist tunnel and by the terrorists in the border area,” Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot told Israeli Army radio.Israel said in a Wednesday press conference that the missiles had originated not by Hamas, but from the Palestinian terrorists. They were fired at Israel from a tunnel dug by Palestinians, within the Israeli territory, Eizenkot said.The army's statement Thursday night said that terrorists "from the vicinity of the border fired rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, which caused damage to border communities."The IDF	0
When Black Caviar lines up at Morphetville, Adelaide, on Sunday in front of an anticipated crowd of 30,000, the Australian wonder horse will carry the weight not only of jockey Luke Nolen but the expectations of an entire nation. The superstar mare will be bidding for her 20th win from 20 races. If she succeeds, she will have gone one better than the great Zenyatta, who faltered at the 20th attempt. Black Caviar has already overhauled the marks of such racing legends as Eclipse (undefeated in 18 races) and Nearco (14). Indeed, one has to go all the way back to Kincsem, a 19th century Hungarian racehorse, to find a more impressive streak (although her barely creditable record of 54 wins and no defeats seems safe for the time being). The Black Caviar phenomenon has gripped a sports-mad Australian public. Of the capacity crowd expected to turn out on Sunday, a good proportion will be wearing her trademark salmon and black silks. The appetite for all things Black Caviar is so great that the state government has arranged free public transport for all those heading to the track. She will face only a small number of rivals on Sunday. Such is the aura of invincibility surrounding Black Caviar, she typically races against just a handful of other runners. She is currently being quoted by some bookmakers at odds of 1-20 (and no, that's not a misprint) for the Group 1 clash, ahead of last year's Goodwood winner Lone Rock at 14-1. But despite having beaten the best Australian racehorses of her generation -- including Hay List and Foxwedge, both classy runners in their own right -- Black Caviar remains unproven on the global stage. That is set to change, however. In June, Black Caviar will get the chance to test herself against the best in the world when she travels to England for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. For Australians, Black Caviar's English endeavor is something of a national cause. But if she has little left to prove to an adoring public back home, a question mark remains over Black Caviar's claims to greatness on the world stage, and that question mark comes in the not-insubstantial shape of a four-year-old bay colt called Frankel.	1
The latest Charlie Hebdo cartoon, produced after last week's horrific attacks on the Paris magazine's offices, literally adds insult to injury.  Admittedly a portrait in mixed messages, the cover reads "All is forgiven" above a drawing of the Prophet Mohammed, who is holding a "Je suis Charlie" sign.  Who, exactly, is supposed to be doing the forgiving and who must be forgiven is not clear. Zineb El Rhazoui, a writer with Charlie Hebdo, said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings.  But the cover could also be interpreted as Mohammed saying he forgives the cartoonists in a way the terrorists, obviously, did not. But the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant. As Middle East analyst Juan Cole has argued, they were just an excuse for Islamic zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between Islam and "the West."  Cole writes, "Al Qaeda wants to mentally colonize French Muslims, but faces a wall of disinterest. But if it can get non-Muslim French to be beastly to ethnic Muslims on the grounds that they are Muslims, it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination."  Enter the cartoons. This is why it is baffling that political voices around the world, especially conservatives, have argued that we must show our support for Charlie Hebdo and free speech by reprinting the magazine's offensive cartoons. Remember, this is a publication few outside France had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read -- and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context. In fact, in a line of thinking best articulated by New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Ross Douthat, the violent reaction to Charlie Hebdo's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest.  "If a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something, then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said," wrote Douthat.  In other words, the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but valorizes its rationale going forward?	1
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast that killed 10 people near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar on Wednesday, the latest in violent incidents that have marred the first month of the new year. The incident, a suicide attack, marked the first time a militant group claimed responsibility for an attack on the consulate in Pakistan.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar on Wednesday that killed 10 people and wounded 15 others.The Taliban, an armed group linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility on its websites and in statements after the attack in which eight security guards and six civilians were killed and 15 others wounded.A suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives into the diplomatic section of the compound in the eastern part of Peshawar, blowing out windows and damaging the compound's walls.

Talks aimed at ending 50 years of fighting between FARC guerrillas and Colombian forces are expected to take place Wednesday in Norway. In an interview last month, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he was hopeful about the prospect for peace. The sides were able to negotiate a "short" and "pragmatic" agenda for the talks, he said. Santos said he has been thinking about the possibility of peace ever since the FARC's military commander was killed in 2010. Read more: Five facts about Colombia's FARC rebels A developing economy and the military successes Colombia has scored against the FARC make it a good time for negotiations, according to Santos. After starting in Oslo, the talks will move to Havana, Cuba. Peace talks between the rebels -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. The two sides have been at war since the 1960s, making it Latin America's oldest insurgency. Santos said the group must be permitted to participate in the political process. Read more: FARC ready to lay down arms if government does, members say "You can't ask the FARC to simply kneel down, surrender and give us the arms," Santos said. "They will not do that, so there has to be some kind of way out, and this way out has to be you can be able to participate in the political arena. This is a way any conflict is settled, not only the Colombian conflict." Yet, the president has said their will be no cease-fire while the two sides are in talks, though the rebels have said they would ask for one. "I've told them there will be cease-fire and we will stop any military operation when we reach a final agreement," Santos said. "And if I see that there's no progress, that they are simply trying to buy time, I will stand up and continue business as usual. And that's why there's no cease-fire, no decrease in our military operations, and my government agenda will continue as it was until then." Read more: Colombian rebels free French journalist	1
And now, the rejects. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of "Air Force One" flying  over the San Francisco Bay, the same plane is undergoing a thorough inspection. And what will the Air Force do?The VC-25 was just hours old when it was forced to make a landing at the Oakland-Thousand Oaks Airport where a mechanic noticed a fault with a control system. Once fixed, the plane resumed its journey to Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Air Force officials were surprised to discover how much was wrong with the plane, but the repair costs are unknown.The photo released by the White House is a composite of the top picture taken at the San Francisco airport and a second (bottom) that shows the plane as it was just before it was forced to make a landing at the Oakland airport. This composite picture has now been debunked by a photo expert to the Air Force (and other places).So the White House has now released one of the two photos taken of Air Force One on August 5, 2003, and the other is a composite.A photo expert found out that both of the pictures are a composite, and they were taken in very different places.The photo expert used a new version of Photoshop that makes the composite more acceptable, and the Air Force is satisfied.A spokesperson for the Air Force told the San Francisco Gate:The Air Force appreciates President Bush's support for our aviation capabilities.We are satisfied that when the VC-25 was on the ground and undergoing an investigation, the airman responsible for its safe flight was properly trained.At this point, all we can do is wait to see what the Air Force does.The VC-25 is scheduled to make another flight on Thursday, it's expected to be inspected again at Andrews Air Force Base and then finally sent to the White House for final inspection. At this point, we've heard that some of the planes were found to be overweight, and this was a violation of the FAA regulations, but that may well be the fault of the FAA.	0
A federal judge Friday ruled in favor of a former UCLA college basketball star who sued to end the NCAA's control over the rights to college athletes' names, images and likenesses. In a landmark decision, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken  ruled against the NCAA and its enforcement arm, the NCAA Committee on Infractions.On March 30, 2011, the NCAA informed UCLA's former All-American and NBA star Antoine Walker that he had forfeited his remaining eligibility and could not play for the Bruins and the Los Angeles Clippers without "a ruling that you are in violation of a specific NCAA rule, or that you are ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics."In her decision, Wilken ordered the NCAA "to cease and desist" from enforcing its "amended rule," which stated that UCLA must prohibit its players from "taking action that interferes with the commercial exploitation of their names, images and likenesses through various means, including but not limited to commercial endorsements, endorsements from other sports or professional sports leagues, and Internet websites."Wilken's ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Walker, the NBA player turned entrepreneur, and his company, Walker Sports Enterprises, LLC. Walker, who lives in his native California, alleged that after he was declared ineligible, both the NCAA and Walker Sports Enterprises took "affirmative acts of restraint" to "freeze in place" Walker's commercial rights and prohibit him from participating in the Olympics, NBA All-Star Game, and other league and national team events. Walker Sports Enterprises, LLC, also alleges that the NCAA and the NCAA Committee on Infractions are misusing its powers and conducting unconstitutional and partisan investigations into its members and Walker Sports Enterprises, LLC.The NCAA is not challenging Walker's decision to forfeit, but rather the NCAA Committee on Infractions' decision not to enforce the rule."I am overjoyed that the Court has finally recognized how far off track this Committee has been and that it is time to bring the Commission on Infractions in line with the court system's standards," said Committee Chair Steve Simon in a statement. "The court is now in the perfect position to ensure that the Committee follows through on its responsibility to act in the public’s interest.""This is a huge triumph for the NCAA as a whole," said Tom Phillips, Walker's attorney. "The NCAA is in uncharted legal territory and it has no	0
A Massachusetts judge ruled Monday that the public should know exactly what investigators seized from the home of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, who has been charged with murder in the death of a friend. Bristol County Âbased Bristol District Court Judge Jacqueline Campbell upheld a warrant for the search of the Â½ million dollar home in Hernandezâs hometown of Bristol. Campbellâs order will allow reporters to be present to record and record tape in the weeks before the search. Campbellâs ruling on Monday was the next step in a two-year legal battle over the warrant, but the details sheÂll divulge will be kept under a seal of secrecy because sheÂs in the middle of a lawsuit with the defense that wants the court to order reporters in the room to cover the search. Campbell will tell the court that there have been ânumerous questions about the evidenceâ in the case, and that to prevent any âunnecessary prejudiceâ in the jurorsÂ minds, sheÂd keep reporters in the room. Campbell and attorneys for the defense agreed earlier this year that reporters who wanted to be in the room must go to court.The Associated Press was on the scene as Judge Jacqueline Campbell of Bristol County Massachusetts on Monday approved search warrants for the home of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez.

Tucked away in this small mountain village, off a dusty road flanked by pig farms, is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed. Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, known as "patient zero" survived the earliest documented case of swine flu. Meet the child known as "patient zero" by his doctors -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez, who survived the earliest documented case of swine flu in an outbreak that, officials say, has now spread across four continents. His family lives in the 3,000-population village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz, where a flu outbreak was reported on April 2. State officials arrived and took samples from dozens of people. Lab tests confirmed that Edgar was the only patient in Veracruz to test positive for the swine flu virus; the others had contracted a common flu. Health officials had returned to Edgar's sample only after cases of the new flu strain were spotted around the country. "In this case, there's a patient who turned out to be positive for the swine-flu virus, with the exception that at that time in no region of the world it had been established as an etiological, epidemic cause," said Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova. Edgar has managed to bounce back from his symptoms and playfully credits ice cream for helping him feel better. His mother blamed the virus on a huge pig farm in the neighborhood. Officials have conducted tests at the farm owned by U.S. company Smithfield Foods, and those tests came back negative. Meanwhile, Mexican health officials suspect the swine flu outbreak has caused more than 159 deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses. The World Health Organization says at least 105 cases have been confirmed worldwide, including 64 in the United States; 26 in Mexico; six in Canada; three in New Zealand; and two each in Spain, the United Kingdom and Israel. WHO has confirmed deaths only in Mexico, where seven people have died from swine flu. The deadly outbreak in Mexico prompted authorities to order about 35,000 public venues in Mexico City to close or serve only take-out meals as health officials tried to contain the virus. iReport.com: Are you worried about swine flu?	1
The widow of the man whose life was portrayed in the acclaimed film "American Sniper" has penned a heartfelt letter to him on their 13th anniversary. Taya Kyle posted her letter March 16 on the Chris Kyle Facebook page, where she proclaimed, "I miss you and I love you. I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life." "Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you," she wrote. "Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty." Kyle, a Navy SEAL, has been credited as the most successful sniper in United States military history. Bradley Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Kyle in this winter's film "American Sniper," which was based on Kyle's bestselling autobiography. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, has become the highest-grossing war movie ever. Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield were shot and killed at a gun range in 2013 by Eddie Ray Routh. A Texas jury found Routh  guilty of capital murder in February, and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Marathon talks between Hollywood's largest actors union and producers broke off early Saturday, with the Screen Actors Guild saying it will ask its members to authorize a strike. Screen Actors Guild members and supporters stage a rally in June at SAG's headquarters in Los Angeles, California. SAG's contract with Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers expired June 30 with the two sides unable to agree on how actors would be paid when movies and TV shows are distributed through "new media," such as mobile phones and the Internet. "As previously authorized by the national board of directors, we will now launch a full-scale education campaign in support of a strike authorization referendum," SAG said in a statement Saturday. There was no mention of when a strike referendum might be called. "Let's review the facts: SAG is the only major Hollywood guild that has failed to negotiate a labor deal in 2008," the producers' group said in a Saturday statement. "Now, SAG is bizarrely asking its members to bail out the failed negotiating strategy with a strike vote -- at a time of historic economic crisis. The tone-deafness of SAG is stunning." SAG and AMPTP representatives came together under the guidance of a federal mediator Thursday for their first talks since July. The effort ended at 1 a.m. Saturday after 27 hours of talks. The producers' alliance has demanded that SAG accept terms similar to those in contracts concluded over the past year with six other unions representing writers, directors, stagehands, casting directors and a smaller actors union. "Taken together, these six new labor agreements will keep our industry at work, allow producers to experiment with new media, and give everyone in our industry a stake in the success of new and emerging markets," the producers' group said Wednesday. The SAG statement suggested that a strike authorization would not immediately trigger a walkout but would strengthen the actors' bargaining position. "Now it's time for SAG members to stand united and empower the national negotiating committee to bargain with the strength of a possible work stoppage behind them," it said. SAG's board of directors voted last month to ask for a federal mediator to help with the negotiations. At the same board meeting, it authorized a strike referendum in the event the mediation effort failed.	1

Sen. Ted Cruz lauded the Republican Senate takeover Tuesday night, but shied away from endorsing Sen. Mitch McConnell to lead the new majority. The Texas Republican declined to say whether he would vote for McConnell -- the current Senate minority leader -- to become the Senate majority leader. "That'll be a decision for the conference to make and that'll be decided next week," Cruz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer twice on CNN. "Tonight what I'm focused on is the results of this election, which is a resounding Republican majority," Cruz said. It's not the first time that Cruz, a tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential contender, has skirted the question, also declining to pledge his loyalty to McConnell in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday. But Cruz did say that Americans are "frustrated with what's happening in Washington." And McConnell might just be the face of that Republican establishment, having served in Congress for the past three decades. "Now the responsibility falls on us to lead with a positive, bold, optimistic, pro-jobs agenda and I hope that we see Republicans unite," Cruz said. "I think a lot of voters are skeptical of politicians in both parties and I very much hope that my party can validate and earn the trust that's been placed in us and that we can stand up, listen to the people." Cruz also said he believes Republicans will be willing to work with Obama "if the President is willing to work with us." And Cruz said Republicans need to pass legislation to repeal Obamacare, though he conceded that Obama would "almost surely" veto full repeal. Mitch McConnell re-elected	1
As ISIS continues its campaign in both Syria and Iraq, a group called Samaritan's Purse is hoping shoeboxes filled with gifts might give comfort to refugees of the crisis. On a sunny but windy day on the tarmac of Baltimore-Washington International Airport, volunteers from the group loaded pallets filled with some 60,000 boxes of gifts onto a 747-jet. Those boxes contain everything from hand-written notes of well-wishes to furry toy ponies. They'll end up in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq where they will be distributed to children living in refugee camps in both Iraq and Syria as part of "Operation Christmas Child." Children from the U.S., U.K. and Canada filled the boxes. Though exact numbers are hard to come by, the United Nations estimates there are over a million refugees displaced in Syria and Iraq. President and CEO of Samaritan's Purse Franklin Graham says it's important to try and help these refugees who have almost no hope otherwise. "Most of them are children," Graham said. "About 70% of Syrian refugees are children. And they've fled with just the clothes on their back, they have nothing." And it's not just Iraq and Syria where Samaritan's Purse has focused their attention. Kids in more than 150 countries have received over a hundred million boxes since 1993. Samaritan's Purse is a Christian organization headed up by the son of one of the most famous Christian evangelists in the country, Billy Graham. Sometimes these packages can have more than just short-term effects. Franklin Graham told the story of then seven-year-old Tyler Wolfe who in the year 2000 sent a Christmas shoebox gift to a child named Joana Marchan in the Philippines. With the power of the internet and a few long plane rides over a decade later, the two eventually connected in-person and married in October.	1
Reaction to the arrest of International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn ranged from concern to outrage to sadness Tuesday in France, where one politician said he was the victim of a "lynching" and others cautioned against ills rooted in racism."I am profoundly saddened to be targeted (by the scandal)," Strauss-Kahn said in an emailed statement released by his office Tuesday, adding that he was "deeply shaken by my arrest."“It is hard to believe that a person so highly regarded could commit so many crimes against women,” he continued.Polls suggest that Strauss-Kahn's approval rating has slipped in France, where he is facing trial. The scandal could also dent his chances of being nominated for a second consecutive term in next year's election.“It will be difficult to get him and the Socialist party out of the government in a second term," Alain Juppe, a former French president, said in a television interview."People are waiting for a political and personal explanation. The Socialist party will have to put its shoulders to the wheel."In a speech Tuesday night, Strauss-Kahn said he has "no secrets from the American authorities," but denied being a war criminal, saying he wanted to explain his side of the story and offered no apologies to the victims."I am going to put the truth before the French people, and I am happy to answer their questions," he said.On the eve of the French presidential election in April, Strauss-Kahn, a former Socialist minister, denied involvement in human rights abuses in his native Germany in what he described as a consensual relationship with a prostitute.But a police raid on his apartment in the German capital on Aug. 19 prompted the most serious charges in a scandal that has gripped the country since New York police arrested him on Tuesday. He denies the charges.The accusations had been building for weeks. Strauss-Kahn, who had been hospitalized for two months, told German media that he had engaged in consensual sex with a woman in a private room at the New York hotel where he was staying.Strauss-Kahn left Germany at the end of October, but had been expected to return after completing a six-month assignment in Washington.The arrest of the International Monetary Fund chief was a surprise in France because of widespread support in the country	0
Is the United States the "greatest country on earth"? You hear that a lot, or phrases like that, during this presidential campaign. Candidates may attack other candidates, or the sitting president, but they never attack the  United States of America.That's because it's a fallacy. The U.S. is by any measure, the greatest country in the world. We lead the world in many things: population, income, military power, and, for the last 50 years, our ability to provide universal healthcare. We have freedom of speech, we have free enterprise, and we have the most advanced science in the world.And yet, it's a myth. The reason is that our self-image is not one of a land of opportunity, but of a country that has been systematically denied opportunities for many generations. We've denied our children the chance to compete on an equal footing with the rest of the world because of a deeply ingrained belief that they are not good enough.What America's youth deserve is the chance to experience the success of success and to prove to themselves and others that they are worthy to succeed. They deserve the chance to take risks and make mistakes, to make their own mistakes and to improve what will be their ultimate legacy.In this spirit, we offer 12 rules that each of us can embrace as we approach Election Day.1. No matter what happens on Election Day, we must vote for America. I will never vote for Hillary Clinton. I will never support Trump, either. I will never give any money to a Trump campaign.The reason is simple: Hillary Clinton, despite a lifetime of serving the "interests" of the Democratic establishment, is a friend not only to the Democratic Party, but to the American people. She has not only betrayed our country, but has done so to serve the interests of Wall Street and the financial industry.2. I am with you, for your children's sake. I will not support either candidate who is openly hostile to the future of our children. I do not think the Democratic nominee will honor the Constitution or, in any way, shape, or form, advance our country's mission of creating a society based on inalienable truths, justice, and individual liberty.3. Do not let the Republican nominee tell us, over and over again, that this is a "rigged election."Donald Trump has repeatedly	0
Soupy Sales, a comedian from the golden era of television, died Thursday. He was 83. The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York urn after declining treatment for complications from stomach cancer he developed in 1994."He was the father of many grandchildren and great-grandchildren and he will truly be missed, as will his many friends," his children said in a statement. "He was a man who lived his life to the fullest and he will be missed beyond his days."Soupy's comedy was an amalgam of pop culture tropes and pop-culture ephemera. He often created his zany characters through the unlikely intersection of pop culture and real-world events. His most famous creation was "Wacky Wally," a wannabe actor (played by Bob Barker) who used his signature catchphrase "Wahoo, woo hoo" to make a variety of cameos on American television.Soupy's catchphrases also made him one of the most-quoted comedians of all time (with his trademark "Geez, that was awesome" quote getting more than 50,000 retweets and 1,000 likes on Twitter at one point).He was known as an inspiration to generations of humorists, and the comedian's most memorable characters were beloved by fans not only in his home country of Japan, but also around the globe. His most famous characters include Wacky Wally, "Little Barry," and the late Wally Karate.He was also known for his quick wit, as he once took an on-air tirade on a morning news show against NBC by joking that there "was no difference between him and President Obama," only to correct himself in front of the camera.He was born August 5, 1933 in Osaka, Japan, to Kenji Souyoshi, a journalist, and his wife, Shizuko. He was fluent in both English and Japanese at a young age and was encouraged to learn the latter, which he did.Soupy entered the entertainment industry through a talent agency, where he met his first wife, Masaki. They dated for 10 years before he wed Chiyo. He worked as a radio announcer during World War II, when the Japanese government had strict quotas on American journalists working in the country.After World War II, he returned to the entertainment industry, and met his	0
Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the Transportation Security Administration's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy. Both groups say they learned about the policy change Tuesday, and charged that the TSA is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency. "It's as if we didn't learn anything from 9/11," said George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). "Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks." On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25. Former TSA chief backs 'knife' decision; suggests axes and machetes, too Pocketknives will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters), which is shorter than the 4-inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks. And they must adhere to other rules: the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point, it cannot have a locking or fixed blade and cannot have a molded grip. Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin. The TSA also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues, ski poles, hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry-on baggage. It will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces. Some experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary. But Taylor said he is "appalled" by the decision, and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him. "I've received probably over a hundred (calls from air marshals). They're very upset." FLEOA President Jon Adler said the dangers extend beyond air marshals. "Pistole's decision is putting my guys at greater risk," Adler said. "It's not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it's all of my guys," he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights.	1
No decision has been made on whether to change the current plan to hold the September 11 terrorist attack trial in a civilian court in lower Manhattan, White House officials said Sunday. Last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians iced the trial in lower Manhattan on the grounds that the nation's largest city would bear the costs of holding the trial in open court in a time of budget constraints.That is now no longer the case. New York City has agreed to pay for the trial's travel -- which will be the first such expense -- and security costs through the end of the trial.The announcement came as President Bush declared that he would not seek a special prosecutor to investigate potential links between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, al Qaeda and the attack on the World Trade Center."The United States has no credible evidence linking Iraq to this terrorist attack," he said. "We have no evidence whatsoever in this case of any kind of complicity."The president said the attack is "a crime that is truly despicable."Bush also said that the United States is in a "very strong position" to hold Saddam accountable for what he did."There will be consequences for the people of Iraq," Bush said of the decision. "We should think about this process, and this war, in terms of where the world sees a threat. ... Where they see a threat is that Saddam Hussein."Bush had previously said he had no intention of pursuing a special investigation into links between the Iraq-al Qaeda link.White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that the president had made the decision to pursue a case against Saddam and that the administration will continue to do so through the military commissions set up to try him."Saddam Hussein is the central figure in the September 11th plot," Bush said. "And the administration's position is that his arrest -- and ultimately his trial -- is a major priority."McClellan also said that Bush has been working with Congress on a timetable to act on Saddam."There is no timetable at this time, but ultimately, the president intends to bring Saddam Hussein before the United Nations Security Council based on the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council," he said. "The president is working with Congress on an appropriate legislative package, including an appropriate timetable, that will provide Saddam Hussein and those responsible for these crimes with the authority to be brought before the international community."	0
Six volunteer astronauts emerged from a 'trip' to Mars on Friday, waving and grinning widely after spending 520 days in seclusion. Crowds handed each member of the group a red rose after their capsule opened at the  Kibo laboratory on the Japanese space agency's International Space Station. They were dressed in what they called the 'green of the sky'. The volunteers, who came from all over the world, are now returning home. They will make a total of five trips to Mars in 2016.The crew of NASA's Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, completed a drive around the planet on Thursday, discovering new rock formations and exploring a huge crater as it turned out was an impact crater.

Last year we published a list of quintessential Americana experiences. You can find it here. They weren't necessarily the most patriotic, obvious or agreeable choices. NASCAR, bourbon, state fairs, Vegas, what's not to love? Apparently, plenty. There was scandal. There was outrage. There was name calling. Because we're gluttons for punishment -- or maybe just because we think we actually can please all of the people all of the time -- we're back for round two. Here's our Volume II of the most authentically American experiences this country has to offer. 1. Seaside boardwalks Boardwalks have been enhancing beachside amusement since long before the Drifters' released their classic "Under the Boardwalk" in 1964. The first boardwalk was built in Atlantic City in 1870, when a railroad conductor was asked to find a way to prevent sand from filling shorefront hotel entryways. The innovation remains America's favorite wooden path, showing up everywhere from Monopoly, which was inspired by "America's Favorite Playground," to the HBO series "Boardwalk Empire," which takes place in Prohibition-era Atlantic City. Of course, you don't have to travel to Jersey to experience the joy of a lumber-pathed stroll; there are more than 60 boardwalks split between America's coasts. Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, includes roller coasters, carnival attractions, Nathan's Famous hot dogs and other slices of Americana. Out West, the Venice Boardwalk in California offers bodybuilders, artists, trinket sellers, magicians and boutique shops a place to be seen. 2. Pueblos and powwows One of the most inspiring American experiences is witnessing the culture of the first Americans come alive in a spectacle of swirling, pulsing color. Every April, approximately 3,000 Native American dancers and singers from roughly 700 tribes come together in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to compete and celebrate their heritage. The teams blend traditional style with modern, innovative techniques, so the result is more than just living history, it's the evolution of a culture that most Americans think has all but died away. In the same area are many pueblo sites that provide tours of cave dwellings and indigenous architecture. Perhaps the most memorable is Taos Pueblo, 2Â½ hours northwest of Albuquerque. This village of adobe buildings has been continually occupied by Native Americans for more than a thousand years.	1
The head of China's quality watchdog is reported to have resigned over the tainted baby milk scandal that has killed four children and sickened nearly 53,000 others. The official Xinhua News Agency said Li Changjiang had quit with the approval of China's State Council. Li's agency is responsible for ensuring that China's food supply chain is safe. Monday's resignation came hours after the World Health Organization said the scandal had highlighted flaws in the country's entire food supply chain. The chemical melamine blamed for causing kidney stones and kidney failure has been detected in formula milk powder from 22 dairies across China. The crisis was initially thought to have been confined to baby milk powder, but tests have found melamine in samples of liquid milk taken from China's two largest dairy producers, Mengniu Dairy Group and Yili Industrial Group, as well as Shanghai-based Bright Dairy. WHO China representative Hans Troedsson said on Monday quality issues could occur anywhere from the farm to the retail outlet. He said "it's clearly something that is not acceptable and needs to be rectified and corrected," according to The Associated Press. Troedsson said the WHO was discussing with officials how to strengthen China's food quality system. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called milk manufacturers "heartless" and promised stricter laws to protect the public. China's Health Ministry said Sunday that about 13,000 children were hospitalized, while another 40,000 had undergone outpatient treatment for illnesses related to suspected melamine-tainted milk products. The scandal has spread beyond the mainland with melamine being found in three Chinese-made dairy products in Singapore. The country's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said tests on "White Rabbit Creamy Candy" showed that it was contaminated with melamine and it ordered stores to remove the product from shelves. Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday. And a second child in Hong Kong has been diagnosed with a kidney stones after drinking the tainted milk as worried parents continued to take their children for health checkups, the government said Monday, AP reported. The 4-year-old boy was in hospital in a stable condition, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. A three-year-old girl was sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk over the weekend -- the first known illness outside of mainland China.	1
Ukraine and Dynamo Kiev striker Andriy Shevchenko is hanging up his football boots to begin a career in politics. Ahead of the October parliamentary  elections, the Ukrainian football star will run in the fourth round of the presidential race for the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine (LDPR). However, he will be leaving the game of football behind, saying that “as a footballer I am a very emotional man. For me there is no emotion like that”.In the current Ukraine politics is very personal, even if a politician from the LDPR party is not the same as a president of Ukraine. But in the eyes of some of the greatest talents in Ukraine, Shevchenko deserves this new challenge. Shevchenko is one of the best players of this generation of footballers. The Ukrainian, who made his breakthrough when he was 15 (during the 2000 FIFA World Cup in Germany) and spent several seasons on the Ukrainian Premier League best team, is now 25 years old and the “star of his team”.It is one of the longest careers in football after Andriy Shevchenko – the world’s best for footballers. At the age of 13 he scored three goals in the UEFA Champions’ League against Bayern Munich (the match for which he is most remembered by fans of Ukraine). He then spent the next few years playing in the Ukrainian Premier League with four teams. At the age of 15 he transferred to the Ukrainian Superleague for a season with Sloboda Uar, where he made a name for himself. From there he went to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan, which at the time were the world’s best teams.During this decade, Shevchenko took the world by storm with his fantastic scoring record. He scored nearly 200 goals in the Ukrainian Premier League, scoring five goals in each of the four games of the Champions League competition (Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Sloboda Uar). In 2006, when the Ukraine national football team was participating in the European Championship in France, he was the first to score against the French team in the group stage, when Ukraine lost 2-0. Shevchenko became the first player to score four goals in the final group match of a major tournament.At the age of 21, he left Barcelona to join his favorite team of all times, Real Madrid, for a record transfer fee of $37 million.

With the deaths of three top Syrian officials, questions arose Wednesday as to whether the Damascus attack marks a turning point in the presidency of Bashar al-Assad. As the crisis unfolded, experts looked beyond the day's events to ills plaguing the Syrian state.After a brutal week of violence in recent days, three Syrian officials, Bashar al-Assad, his brother Maher, and his father-in-law, Hizballah's Hassan Nasrallah, were killed in the Damascus regime's latest assault on the city.President Assad denied the charges Wednesday, blaming it on a plot devised by a "foreign conspirators" who were trying to remove the president from power.The bloodshed began when a car bomb exploded as Assad's convoy was traveling eastward to leave the country for the last time Wednesday. The blast ripped through the cars and killed Assad's wife, his brother, Assad's younger son and one of former president Hafez Assad's sons, Bashar al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad, and a third victim.In an interview with French TV on Tuesday, Assad said he believed the attack was carried out by the Israeli secret service Mossad. In a separate interview, he stated the attack on his convoy was a "revenge attack."Assad has come under increasing pressure from his people, who are tired of the bloodshed and the use of force by the Syrian regime, which has been engaged in a brutal conflict against those it considers to be its enemies.The latest loss of life, which took place just days after a cease-fire agreement in Syria was signed by the United States, Russia and the United Nations, has heightened concerns that the country's descent into civil war continues.The Syrian conflict was born out of an attempt by President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez Assad, to gain power through a bloodless revolution that overthrew the government of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in 1981.For three decades, the Assad regime has been engaged in a brutal war against the rebels who refuse to accept the legitimacy of the Ba'ath Party, a regime dominated by Assad's father and Hafez's father.But the uprising that began in March 2011, as a movement against Assad's rule and against the policies of the Assad family, has now begun to threaten the stability of the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.Syria's civil war The civil war in Syria	0
Federal investigators are looking into whether stowaways are tucked inside a shipping container aboard a vessel docked at a Newark, New Jersey, seaport. During a routine security check, a Coast Guard boarding team heard sounds coming from inside the container, prompting the investigation, according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt j.g. Fannie Wilks. "There is no way to know exactly what is inside because we have not opened it yet, but we can knock on the container and hear someone knock back," she said. "Thus it is our understanding that there is at least one person in the container." The Cyprus-flagged cargo ship -- which maintains about 2,000 containers -- last docked in Egypt, and had made a stop in Pakistan after originating in India, officials said. "U.S. Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers and agents are currently investigating allegations of stowaways," said Anthony L. Bucci, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Inspectors first checked the ship around 3 a.m. Wednesday. Just prior to docking, the inspectors tapped on the bulkhead and heard something, said Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe. They "tapped twice" and got "two taps back," he said. "Tapped 3 times" and got "three taps back," Rowe added, a process done periodically over several hours as they investigated. But inspectors haven't heard the suspicious tapping since the ship docked at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. The vessel -- which is named the Ville D' Aquarius and managed by Global Ship Lease Services Limited -- is not loaded with dangerous cargo, and the container in question is underneath several other containers, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa. The operating transportation company is working closely with U.S. officials as they investigate the situation, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for CMA-CGM, a French-based firm considered the world's third largest container shipping company. Captain, second officer jailed over New Zealand cargo ship disaster CNN's Mary Snow, Kristina Sgueglia and Paul Caron contributed to this report	1
Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is a veteran of nearly 300 Formula One races, but he still felt a rush of excitement on Tuesday as Mercedes unveiled their car for the 2012 season. The motorsport legend was joined by fellow German Nico Rosberg and team principal Ross Brawn as Mercedes showed off the new F1 W03 at a preseason test event in Barcelona, Spain. The 43-year-old, who has won more drivers' titles than anyone else in history, is enjoying a second spell in the sport after initially retiring in 2006 -- only to return again in 2010. Despite being unable to replicate the form he showed prior to his first retirement, Schumacher said he is still hungry for success as he prepares for a 19th season in the elite division of motorsport. "I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars, but even after all these years I must say it still feels special," Schumacher, who won two championships with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 and five with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, told the sport's official website. "Days like this are precious moments, as they are always filled with hope and anticipation." Schumacher, who has started 287 grands prix since making his debut in 1991, has failed to finish on the podium since returning to the grid and only registered one top-four finish last year, at June's rain-affected Canadian Grand Prix. Despite disappointing results, he vowed to fight for the hardworking staff at the team's British factories. "I can say already that the guys and girls back in the factories at Brackley and Brixworth were brilliant in putting in so much effort, and we can only say a big thank you them," he said. "I know which reward they would like, and we will definitely try to deliver it. For my part, I am eager to fight again, looking forward to the new season, and I can't wait for it to begin." Rosberg was the first driver to get behind the wheel of the F1 W03 at Silverstone last week. The former Williams pilot was looking forward to learning more about the new car ahead of the season getting under way in Australia next month.	1
Malian authorities have found a mass grave containing 21 bodies thought to be soldiers killed while a junta chief was in power after a 2012 military coup, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said Wednesday. Investigators found the bodies in a grave close to a military camp in the village of Diago, just north of Bamako, spokeswoman Alasane Diarra said. Last week, Gen. Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested, charged with complicity in kidnapping. A failed counter-coup shortly after he seized power pitted two army factions against each other: the green berets loyal to Sanogo and the red berets loyal to ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure. "At the military camp in Diago, there were both green berets and red berets soldiers. We do not know which group the soldiers in the grave belonged to," Diarra said. Investigations into alleged kidnapping and killings after the military takeover that plunged the West African country into chaos have been ongoing since April 30, 2012. "The investigators have been working on the case since April, so just after the coup. They have known about the grave for a while, but when they finally went there and opened the grave, there were more bodies than they previously thought," Diarra said. The bodies are all male and from different ethnic groups, she said. As the bodies are removed from the grave, forensic investigators will start the process of identifying the men. "Families of soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their family members," Diarra said.	1
Naya Rivera can't help but turn heads, and it's not just the Glee star's singing, dancing and eye-catching outfits. Sometimes it's what comes out of her mouth, like her recent comments on "The View" about white people bathing too much. Regardless of how much you shower, Naya Rivera is the gift that keeps giving to celebrity watchers like ourselves. In light of her latest comments, we thought it high time to take a look at five provocative things that Rivera -- at the tender age of 28 -- has already said in a short but outspoken lifetime. White people shower a lot. "I think that white people shower a lot more than ethnic," said Rivera, who was a guest host on the Tuesday edition of "The View." "I feel like showering more than once a day or every day is such a white people thing." "My mom is half black, half Puerto Rican. She showers every day, so I can say this." And her husband, who is white? He often showers several times per day. Case closed! Not so fast. Rivera apologized for any offense she caused the next day on "The View." Kim Kardashian: Lay off the nude photo shoots! "I normally don't. But... you're someone's mother..." said Rivera, posting on Instagram. The "you" is the famous for not-doing-much Kim Kardashian, who had posed au natural for Paper magazine. Faced with a backlash from lovers of all things Kardashian, Rivera—who can actually sing and dance and act—apologized via Instagram. Both men and women like her a lot. Rivera became something of a sexy lesbian icon for her generation when Santana, her character on Glee, finally came out about her relationship with fellow student Brittany (played by Heather Morris). "Getting hit on by both genders is such a champagne problem," she said. Even though she's newly married (to a man), we're happy she understands the compliment. True love conquers not so true love. Rivera married longtime friend and fellow actor Ryan Dorsey last summer, a scant three months after she and rapper Big Sean called off their engagement. "We feel truly blessed to be joined as husband and wife," the Dorseys told Us Weekly. "Our special day was fated and everything we could have ever asked for. True love always prevails." We hope so. Don't mess with my man.	1
The lengthy documents they initially were asked to sign used language even a native English speaker would struggle to understand. The Vietnamese interpreters BP first brought in for safety and cleanup training stirred painful memories and  psychological trauma in the Vietnamese, and they began to question whether they had to obey. The language was so difficult to understand and the interpreters were so poor that they seemed to have no idea what was going on; they often became agitated when BP tried to explain the document they were signing. Most disturbing, the Vietnamese refused to sign documents they hadn’t seen before, and at one point they threw BP’s clipboard and a translation notebook across the room.In the final days of the U.S. bombing, some of the Vietnamese would return to U.S. troops, and some would not.In the final days of the U.S. bombing, some of the Vietnamese would return to U.S. troops, and some would not. This was due to a number of factors, but to many it seemed like one more example of the U.S. bombing failing to achieve its goals. The Vietnamese, though, were more hopeful than the Americans. Among them was Kim Dang, a South Vietnamese communist who was a prisoner in the U.S. prison at Abu Ghraib. He was released to Vietnam in late 2004.During the war, the Americans had told him that his father had collaborated with the Americans and, as a result, was killed in the war. They also said that his mother had fled to Canada. Now here was the man, a former communist soldier, returned to Vietnam. He was so angry that he wanted nothing but a Communist victory in Vietnam. He was determined not only to go to the war but to get on with his life.Kim went to Washington University to study for a Ph.D. in social sciences. He had two objectives: he wanted to be able to read the Declaration of Independence and, he figured, one of the main objectives of the war was the education of Vietnamese and the development of an independent Vietnamese nation. While he was in the classroom, he had no illusions. He was aware of all the reasons why the war had failed. What he couldn’t deny, however, was that he loved the United States, and he felt a desire to return. So he enrolled in a two-week course on U.S. foreign policy that his department had	0
Wildfires on Spain's Canary Islands have forced close to 5,000 people from their homes, the local government said Saturday. Weather conditions are complicating efforts to control the flames, which are burning on two of the islands -- La Gomera and Tenerife. "The crews ... are having trouble stopping the spread of the fires," said Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, an area economy, security and housing minister. He cited winds, high temperatures and low humidity. Helicopters are helping to work both fires and shelters have been set up to assist those forced from their homes, the government said. The blazes have also forced some road closures. Approximately 2,500 people were evacuated on La Gomera, while the number on Tenerife was reported as slightly more than 2,220. The Spanish Canary Islands are located off the northwest coast of Africa.	1
The crops for sale carry labels like "dark vader," "uk cheese" and "white russian." But the overwhelming smell of cannabis gives away the fact that there is really only one item for sale here: medical marijuana. There was little publicity  for the medical marijuana farm in town, but it was still busy, and a few of its crops were selling out on Sunday.One of the most popular items was the brown rice that has a very pungent smell, like that of burnt sugar. This was the specialty here, because there is almost no other place in town that sells rice grown with marijuana - in all its varieties - in the same quantities.The farmers said they got the seed from the growers in Montana: "I'm working for the best," said one of them, "I'm working for the world."Not only has the crop grown into an internationally known product, but also into a cash crop and a national business."In California, I'm bringing a little here, a little there," he said, gesturing at the field, "I'm bringing the best."On the first day of the harvest, the grower said, all his neighbors came to see his rice in the field. Some of them brought food for the neighbors and a meal and a dance for the family."I could never do it," he said.In other parts of the country, it is illegal to grow marijuana for commercial use. In California, it is legal, and the growers there are trying to spread it to states where, too, it is legal. The idea is to provide a new crop in the United States, something that will replace the corn grown under the oppressive conditions of the farms in the past. This has become the new frontier for American agriculture.Since the crop was discovered in California, it has been spreading north and west all over the country, where it is now legal.In the winter of 1976, two people picked up a parcel of grass in the mountains of Colorado, wrapped it in a blanket of leaves and took it to a neighbor in California, who was a farmer.The little plant they brought to the county of San Bernardino didn't look like much, it was very small - only about three inches high and almost nothing on which to feed. The plan was to bring the plants to a commercial grower, who would sell them for the	0
The White House Wednesday said it was "puzzled" by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth. Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer will release "The President is Not a crook: My Thirty Years as a Strident Conservative," which is scheduled to be released Tuesday. The book -- written by Fleischer, who left the White House in 2007 -- is a "compilation of letters and speeches and interviews," the White House said in a statement. 'A man who was willing to do things others would not do and who was willing to stand up for what he believed in,' the first letter in the book reads. 'I hope that people will read this book to learn that there are great and courageous men around this president, who despite all the bad, will always serve our country.' Fleischer was in his first term as White House spokesman, and he was on the job for four years, from 2001 to 2005. Fleischer's criticism of the Bush administration, which he says have become "consumers of spin," may be a reaction to the president's 2005 State of the Union address. On that speech, Bush outlined his tax cutting plan, which later became the Republican Party's central tenet. That speech was marred by what Bush said he believed were lies and faulty intelligence -- and many critics said that the president never corrected his lie about 9/11. Fleischer said that on that day, Bush never acknowledged the lies or his faulty intelligence. Fleischer also described the president as a 'toy of a president' and a man who "wants to be loved, not for what he can do for the country, but for who he is, for who he is as a person." Fleischer is known to have a warm relationship with Bush, but is known to be critical of the president. In his first letter in the book, Fleischer said he was "concerned that the Bush Administration is losing its focus and is becoming obsessed with political spin and who-done-it." Fleischer called the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War "one of the gravest and most complex military decisions" in American history, saying he wanted to know "who is advising him, who is leading him -- and does he have the best interests of the country at heart?" Fleischer noted the president's approval ratings at their all-	0
For a film with such a straightforward title, "Man on a Ledge" turns out to be remarkably convoluted. Poised precipitously atop a high-concept premise, Sam Worthington is an escaped convict attempting to prove his innocence in the most elaborate way possible: He climbs out onto a hotel ledge and creates a suicide spectacle/diversion that allows his brother (Jamie Bell) to steal a diamond from an iniquitous real estate baron played with a perpetual scowl by Ed Harris. It's all ostensibly part of a master plan, as is his requesting Elizabeth Banks' beleaguered negotiator, but it feels as if the filmmakers have tried to stuff the plots of too many different movies into a single casing that's already overflowing with eye-rolling improbabilities. Despite the occasional dumb fun -- especially with the heist portions -- the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk.

The tiger is one of wildlife's most endangered species, but there's one big cat which refuses to be tamed. Meet Radamel Falcao -- or "El Tigre" as his friends nicknamed him after watching him terrorize defenders on the ides of his knees back in May.Forget the Red Sox. Forget the Boston Marathon, where a man was run over by an SUV while on his way home to help with the search for the missing runners. Forget that it appears to have been the first accident on a modern Boston road, the result of a "congestion" of cars trying to get around the incident. And forget about the city's "tiger-killing crisis." They're not on the front page of The Globe today. But that's just because El Tigre is, and the man who killed him is off the front page for now."It’s a story that made headlines around the world, because he had a reputation for being violent and intimidating, so to see him in person seemed almost too fantastic," one of his friends told the Globe.AdvertisementHe's a man who has gone viral for being violent and intimidating, and he goes viral again because he was actually a pretty mild-mannered guy until he was struck on his knees, then put on television. He's even had his own TV show. In other words, he has a lot to be afraid of.And he's not afraid, apparently. He made it out alive. He went to the hospital with no apparent injuries. He says he has been in constant pain but has told reporters he's happy to have it. He plans to attend his son's funeral on Friday, and says his family will go to America for the funeral. He also seems to have no plans to leave Brazil for the United States, where his family lives. Or anywhere else. He said that if he ever comes to the United States he will want to get a visa. The only logical conclusion is that he's just going to sit in his house."He’s got his head up high," his friend told the Globe. "He has a very dignified demeanor about him. He doesn’t want to be noticed at all. He’s not one who enjoys attention."The video of El Tigre, taken by the Brazilian news shows, ends with him standing over the prone man's body	0
Dennis Rodman's flashy visit to North Korea is just a big elaborate show. Don't be fooled by it. The bizarre, seemingly lighthearted episode comes at a time when tensions are again running high and overshadows the pain and suffering faced by ordinary North Koreans. The regime is continuing its dangerous weapons tests, treating its population terribly and starving countless people. On Tuesday, North Korea issued new hostile threats, this time to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953. The regime has made threats in the past, but the intensity of its recent belligerence is unusual. North Korea blatantly violated multiple U.N. Security Resolutions with its December 2012 rocket test and its third nuclear test in February. It has made hostile statements toward the United States and South Korea in reaction to the announcement of the new U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed more sanctions on the regime. Just when the situation seemed to be getting worse, the world suddenly saw the young leader Kim Jong Un receiving an American star with great hospitality and enjoying an afternoon of basketball. What this portrait lacks is the unimaginable level of the suffering of people inside the country who are deprived of basic human rights and food. The regime's track record on human rights is even more ominous than its threats of rockets and nuclear weapons that often provoke the international community. North Korea's history is marred by decades of unimaginable famine. In 2011, Freedom House listed the regime as one of the seven worst violators of human rights in the world. It is a place where political prisoners languish in gulags, escaped defectors testify of cannibalism, and famines decimate the population. The latest reports indicate that the food situation appears to be somewhat improved. In a recent survey conducted by U.N. agencies, the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children was 27.9% and acute malnutrition was 4%. These are not just numbers and statistics. Children's growth and development is being permanently stunted. The impact of endless hunger and recurrent famine has tremendous long-lasting impact on the North Korean people. It has been estimated that 3.5 million North Koreans died of starvation in the severe famine of the 1990s .	1

Given the magnitude of Japan's recession, it should perhaps come as little surprise that the fantasy-obsessed animation industry has received a hard dose of reality. Nobuki Mitani is an "in-between" animator -- one of ursleep, sloth, and boredom -- who grew up dreaming of being a comic book artist. When he was a boy, he watched cartoon TV, and in his teen years he made animation for his friends, eventually making his own show called "My Little Ponies" at age 14. In the future, he hopes to make animation in his spare time.I met Mitani at E3 in Anaheim, where he was giving a presentation about his new project, "Ginga e no Hikari." The show is to be the story of an 11-year-old girl named Kaede, who lives on a family farm, but dreams of the adventures of the three characters at her school -- Himeko, the energetic girl with blond hair (played by Atsuko Maeda) and who dreams of becoming a fighter pilot; Miharu, the tomboy with long brown hair (played by Mikuru Yamashita); and Hanako, the girl who lives in the country with her grandfather (played by Kenichi Yamada).Mitani's animated short for E3 2004.The show is based on a manga that's been serialized in the "Kodomo no Jikan" ("Kodomo's Journal") magazine of Kodansha. It's published in 24 installments and consists of 11 full-color pages that are divided into episodes, or episodes of 22 minutes each. What I love about Mitani's project is that he has created a fantasy world that has an underlying reality -- that, as he says, the show is "more or less real." When I ask Mitani how he pulled that off, he pauses for a minute. "It's like the difference between a fantasy story and a real one," he says, "You have to think really far ahead, and you have to make things look real enough for your audience to be able to suspend disbelief."The show's title, Ginga e no Hikari, is itself a reflection of Mitani's own life. Since childhood, he's dreamed of being in the position of anime's original "king of the hill," the title character of the manga by Koushi Kondou. "	0
Women undergoing in-vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process, depending on their age, says a study published Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet. Transferring three or Â­four embryos resulted in greater implantation rates but was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, the study found.The finding "will help in women's decision-making and ensure a uniform and uniform process for ART cycles," says The Lancet, a respected medical journal based in the UK. "It does make sense to limit the number of embryos to no more than two, if possible, but the right time is early in the cycle."The study, by researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California, saw 1,857 women undergoing fresh in-vitro fertilization who were assigned to have only two embryos transferred at 22 days, compared to 1,945 who had either three or four embryos transferred. The mean age of participants in the study was 32.1 years.Those who had two embryos transferred were more than twice as likely to achieve a pregnancy than those who had three or four embryos transferred, after adjusting for baseline variables such as age, weight, and the cause of infertility. However, after adjusting for those variables and considering the implantation rate as an outcome, the difference between the two groups didn't reach statistical significance. More implantation was seen in the group with two embryos transferred than in the group with three or four embryos transferred. The higher implantation rates seen in the group with two embryos transferred were likely due to increased chances of embryos reaching the blastocyst stage, The Lancet adds.The findings were consistent regardless of the type of infertility, and there were no significant differences between women who were undergoing in-vitro fertilization for tubal, intrauterine, and male-factor infertility.While the study doesn't conclude whether or not the increased rate of implantation seen in the group with two embryos transferred was statistically significant, the findings still provided valuable data for the debate about the optimal number of embryos to be transferred during the procedure.The main concern, says Dr. Susan Zuk, a reproductive endocrinologist and director of a fertility center in Los Angeles, is that the procedure could cause "damage to the embryos, damage to the uterine wall, [or] damage to the endometrium."

In 2012, China announced that in 2017 Hong Kong could elect its chief executive through "universal suffrage." Previously, the leader of the Hong Kong government was picked by an election committee of between 800 and 1,200 members, most of whom were trusted by Beijing. In effect, Beijing had established procedures that ensured that a member of the territory's establishment would be in charge. But China's 2012 promise created hopes among the public that the chief executive would be picked through a truly democratic election. Those hopes have now been dashed, and it is likely that China has bought itself more instability, not less. Beijing preserves control On August 31, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced a decision regarding the procedures for the next chief executive election. If the plan is actually passed, Hong Kong will get universal suffrage in the narrow sense that eligible voters will be the ones to pick the chief executive, not an election committee. But Beijing has preserved significant control by instituting a restrictive process for nominating candidates. It insisted that a nominating committee would pick candidates (not political parties, and not by popular nomination). And surprise, surprise: the nominating committee will be modeled on the old election committee. The new body would be composed mainly of people who are sympathetic to Beijing's desire for order and who don't want to see Hong Kong's economic growth, in which many of the members are invested, disrupted by politics. In addition, over half of the nominating committee would have to approve each candidate, which means that no pan-democrat could get nominated if Beijing disapproved of him or her. So under the plan Hong Kong voters would have a choice, but the pro-democracy camp suspects that the choice will be among two or three like-minded and Beijing-friendly candidates. Will it be approved? This new system is unlikely to be established because it must be approved by a two-thirds vote of Hong Kong's legislature. If pro-democracy lawmakers stick together, they have enough votes to veto the scheme, in which case the selection procedure reverts to the prior, "small-circle" system. That would be a great tragedy. A sensible compromise was objectively possible -- one that democratized the nominating process in such a way that produced a competitive election and a clear choice between an establishment and pro-democracy candidate. That was an approach that would have likely commanded two-thirds approval.	1
A volcanic eruption in Indonesia that has displaced more than 22,000 people is intensifying, local authorities say. Mount Sinabung, which Â is located on the island of Sumatra, has suddenly begun erupting after being dormant for the past 30 years. The volcano sent a cloud of ash into the sky, prompting authorities to move hundreds of people from the most affected area. And on Monday, officials were forced to evacuate more than 500 people after a mountain flare-up. The evacuation order was extended on Tuesday, when a second flare-up took place in a nearby mountain, forcing officials to issue a more severe warning.The eruption, the first in 30 years, is intensifying and was sparked by the collapse of a fault line, the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said in a statement. The eruption left more than 100 people injured, it said. More than 22,000 people were being evacuated from nearby areas, it added. Earlier, the agency said the eruption might have been sparked by a collapse in another part of the mountain. There is no volcanic fissure on the volcano. The volcano is in the Java island archipelago but has erupted on Sumatra, which is the largest volcanic island in the world. The eruption of Sinabung, located some 3,000 meters above sea level, also prompted Indonesian authorities to make an emergency evacuation order on the island of Banten, according to the BNPB. However, the Banten Governor said the order did not apply to the area affected by the volcano.This week, at least two earthquakes have been registered at the volcano, but there are doubts that they were caused by the eruption. “No earthquake has shown the signature of the eruption,” Geoscience Indonesia director Yohanes Kamel said. Authorities began evacuating the areas around the volcano a day before the eruption. The eruption, which officials said could kill more than 80 people, took place nearly a month earlier, but triggered only sparse protests among local residents. Authorities warned people to stay away from the villages around Mount Sinabung but did not issue a formal evacuation order. Earlier, officials said they feared the eruption would trigger mass funerals for those buried beneath ash. “It probably could cause the death of many people,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.Mount Sinabung, which last erupted in 1963, is one	0
Tennis ace Serena Williams clarified Wednesday the controversial comments she made in a magazine article about the victim's role in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case that garnered national headlines earlier  in the year.In the magazine interview Williams said she and her close friend Sabrina Ellis were "too caught up in our own drama, we were too consumed by our own rage, and we lost sight of everything around us."During the same interview she also said she'd be lying if she tried to shield the teenage boy as he and his friend were driven home after the brutal attack by a 16-year-old victim of the boys' encounter with the coach.Williams, 25, then had to be reminded a few minutes later that the boy's role in the alleged rape wasn't mentioned."It's still rape, isn't it?" she responded, explaining that she used the "R" word again when answering the media reporter who asked about the boy's role."It was certainly not my intention to demean the victim," she said. "I certainly didn't mean to say that the boy was involved in the attack. It was just an unfortunate choice of words."Williams then acknowledged she had been angry on the day of the alleged attack, when she and her friend were asked to give a statement to police and then to the media, but she said it was because of her frustration at being a victim of violence."I certainly don't hold anything against the victims of sexual assault and it was certainly not my intention to offend anyone," she said. "This was an incident which happened to two teenage girls that I know very well and that's it. They're both still young girls, and I will not try and make light of it in any way. I am angry that I was targeted by certain individual and that's all that this is."Williams' comments were widely and instantly criticized since they were made in an interview with People magazine. The magazine also cited that a friend of the victim, 19-year-old Michael Barden, said he was "angry" that she did not apologize for her choice of words.Williams' friend, Ellis, is quoted as saying in the magazine story that she and her friend had been caught up in a "drama.""And so, we were too caught up in our own drama, we were too consumed by our own	0
An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law. "We did not enforce martial law. Everything is normal," said Chao Lumen, an official with the information department of Xilingol prefecture. In the report released Friday, Amnesty International detailed protests in and around the city of Xilinhot, the prefecture's seat of government. "Nothing happened here. There were no demonstrations or protests," Chao said Monday. The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests. The region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between Mongolians, who have lived in the area for centuries, and the Han people, who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Han people are the majority ethnic group in China. According to the human rights organization, 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot, in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of "Mergen," who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans. Amnesty reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of Chinese authorities. In a clip posted to YouTube that purports to show that same demonstration, a large group of people, many of whom are young people wearing school uniforms, can be seen walking through the streets. The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, "defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. The group refers to the area as "southern" -- not "inner" -- Mongolia, and would like to see the region achieve independence or merge with Mongolia. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip. According to Amnesty, the protests, which started May 23, have been largely peaceful, but at least 18 people were reported injured in confrontations with police northeast of Xilinhot, in Right Ujimchin Banner, or Xi Wu Qi in Mandarin. "The protests are a wake-up call for the authorities. As in other minority areas, authorities must start heeding the message rather than attacking the messengers," said Catherine Baber, Amnesty's Asia pacific deputy director.	1
its first in two decades -- aim to create a facade of democracy. The constitution requires more than Â­half of parliament's seats to be filled by candidates elected by voters, but more than 25% of voters were not able to vote in the 2009 European election. The new parliament also will be smaller: The size of the previous parliament was 394 seats, and the new parliament will be reduced to 331 seats.The European election commission has decided to give Greece another four years to get its act together (the EU-IMF bailout program will end in 2012 if Greece makes progress). It plans to appoint a new chairman for the election commission, to replace the outgoing one, which is due to be dissolved next June. The new prime minister must be elected by lawmakers at the next parliamentary election, which will be held in November. ÂGreece has had two government ministers fired for corruption charges, a law to crack down on corruption has been approved, and there is growing pressure for Prime Minister George Papandreou to resign. That could happen, though the Greek parliament seems to prefer a short-term solution for the new government: The government announced on Thursday (Feb. 13) that it would propose the resignation of Prime Minister George Papandreou when Athens holds a special parliamentary session next year to take up the question of the new government's formation.

Two Indian sailors were found dead Thursday a day after the submarine they were on filled with toxic smoke, authorities said. The accident, the latest in a series of problems  involving the nuclear submarine INS Sindhuratna, forced the crew to go to the surface for air at around 7:30 a.m., said a statement issued by the Navy about the fatal submarine accident in the Arabian sea. The statement said the three-man crew, one of them a Navy officer, had just lowered the Sindhuratna to its berth at the Naval dockyard at Srinagar, Kashmir, when they suddenly died. Three others on board were injured.In a statement, the Navy said the three were “highly experienced sailors” and they died of respiratory failure caused by acute carbon monoxide poisoning. The crew was trying to lower the ship to the deck by a device known as a “puffer” after several attempts to raise it failed.While one sailor died with the device still in the air, the second died when it failed to deploy, and the third died when it was lowered by mistake. The body of the second sailor was found in the water 10 miles from the port, about 200 miles away from where it was first discovered about two hours after the accident.An Indian Navy spokesman told The Washington Post the sailor may have been “exhaustion-fueled.”“It was an intense exercise and he died during the exercise,” said a Navy source who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.Earlier Thursday, the captain of INS Sindhuratna and a deputy contacted their superiors to report the incident after the crew started to die, a navy official said. The crew was not asked to evacuate before its propulsion failed, the official said.A source familiar with the submarine's maintenance and operations said the crew was in good spirits before the accident, and that the sailors were not experiencing any physical problems.The sub was last inspected by a team of three to five experts who looked for signs of defects at the end of March. On April 1, the sub failed a routine inspection due to damage to a nuclear reactor.The INS Sindhuratna, built by the French firm DCNS, is the oldest nuclear propulsion submarine in the Indian Navy.(With inputs from Reuters)	0
Venezuela will give a 300-acre island in the Delaware River to the state of New Jersey, the governor's office announced. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez used the Earth Day vernacular to say, "We're throwing a party."MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An opposition leader says the government has begun to deport migrants who come on the back roads to work at the construction sites of oil concerns in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.Duarte Perez said Sunday that the workers are sent to prisons "because they do not have papers, they don't have a birth certificate, nor any other documents."He says that the government does not have enough resources to care for them, so they are sent to prison, where officials are doing their best to deport them."It's an ongoing thing. There are thousands of families who are losing their homes, their farms, their lands. They are being expelled from their houses in Tamaulipas," Perez said.Perez says many of the migrants have been in the country for many years.He says Tamaulipas is a hotbed for illegal migration, including to the U.S., an issue that has become a focus of President Hugo Chavez's government.New York, NY (WCBS 880) - A family in upstate New York claim their home and cars were burgled in a night of horror after they say they were startled by thieves during a home invasion.The Ojeda family says they were awakened by an alarm on Wednesday, November 17, but upon checking the door and windows found it unlocked and the doors locked.They went outside, where the lights were on and the interior of the home and yard were in shambles.They said they couldn't figure out how the burglars got into their home, since it was a gated community on five acres of land."They tore the screens out of the windows. We can't see out and the doors are all ripped off, so that was pretty bad," said family member Juanita Ojeda.The family said they have filed three police reports, but the burglars have still not been caught."They stole like $1,000 in gold chains and furs," said Juanita.Their dog and gold and diamond jewelry also disappeared from the house.	0
Zimbabwe has known only one leader in its entire 33-year history as an independent nation, and President Robert Mugabe hopes that doesn't change any time soon. Voters head to the polls Wednesday for the first time since the violence-marred election in 2008 Ã¢ÂÂ the best show on the road for any politician since the fall of Apartheid.But his election was thrown into chaos, prompting thousands of his supporters to walk out in protest. And it was only thanks to Zimbabwe's relatively high level of literacy that the country survived in the first place.Now it's Mugabe's greatest challenge yet: How to steer Zimbabwe for nearly three decades in the midst of a raging election, a brutal civil war, violent protests and a global economic crisis."It's not an easy task, but the most important one of all," Mugabe said at a news conference Wednesday morning. "The future of our country depends on those who take the responsibility for this country."He said the task would be difficult but not impossible. The country now has a new constitution, elections have been held and voting remains "open," meaning opposition parties can file complaints against alleged irregularities.Mugabe told reporters Wednesday that he plans to run for re-election this year, and will continue to lead the ruling party. He said he's not yet planning on a second term."How could Mugabe run for president again after running for an election, if he didn't win?" said Andrew Tobias, assistant professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta and author of "Mugabe: The Endgame," a look at the political career of Robert Gabriel Mugabe."He has lost all credibility in Zimbabwe," Tobias said. "His political career is over."Mugabe, 85, is the undisputed symbol of Zimbabwe's history. He is also one of its most revered leaders, revered for his leadership in building Zimbabwe into a prosperous economy, where it was a world leader in mineral exports, and for leading the country through the brutal political turmoil that followed decades of rule by white nationalists.He was first elected president in 1980. Mugabe was a member of the ruling ZANU party, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army and Zanu-PF.He was president of South Africa when it was caught up in the 1994 Orange Free State massacre, in which 29 people	0
Investigators are trying to figure out whether the financial fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff was, in fact, the largest Ponzi scheme in history. The alleged scam, which cost investors $50 billion, sounds like a classic Ponzi racket. The New York home of Bernard Madoff, who's accused in a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. But what is a Ponzi scheme? And why does it bear this name? First, you need to know a little bit about its namesake, Charles Ponzi. Anyone can work a simple swindle, but you have to be a special kind of con man to have your name become synonymous with "fraud." Ponzi pulled it off, though. After arriving in the U.S. from Italy in 1903, Ponzi knocked around in a variety of unskilled jobs that usually ended when he got into trouble for theft or cheating customers. A few years later, he moved to Canada, where he spent a hitch in prison for passing a forged check. When he eventually drifted back down to the U.S., he needed a way to make some quick cash.  Watch how a Ponzi scheme works » Making money via mail Ponzi eventually found his way to get rich quick using a vagary of the postal system. At the time, it was common for letters abroad to include an international reply coupon -- a voucher that could be exchanged for minimum postage back to the country from which the letter was sent. Thus, if you sent your buddy in France a letter, you could include a coupon so he could respond. (This practice still exists but is less common.) As exchange and postal rates fluctuated, though, there was an opportunity to make a profit. You only had to purchase postal reply coupons cheaply in some foreign country, send them back to the U.S. to swap them out for American stamps of a higher value, then sell these stamps. This arrangement was perfectly legal; it was just cleverly gaming the system. Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy, and he was making a good living doing it.	1
Pele, Diego Maradona and Franz Beckenbaeur will forever be remembered in football fans' consciousness for helping Brazil, Argentina and West Germany win the World Cup. That trio symbolized the idea that international football -- ersatz or otherwise -- could be part of an international culture.The World Cup is, naturally, a product of such an era. In this era of globalization, the international game took another global step in its evolution. For the first time in history, the competition became a global affair.However, if we think about it, the world's only global competition is the U.S.-led World Cup. Football is not truly a global game, and the U.S. is still the only true global champion. But if the World Cup is the World Cup -- with all its international dimensions -- then England should consider changing the name and start thinking about a new global competition.Since the dawn of the professional era, the English FA has been trying to find a way to expand into overseas markets, which at the time seemed like a pipedream.Today, a decade after the FA made its first overseas foray with the introduction of the Premier League to Asia, the biggest club in the world seems even more inclined to enter those markets.England has the money to go abroad. The country has more than a billion dollars in its coffers, according to the most recent available figures. But the biggest issue remains money. English clubs have been able to afford some major foreign signings because of global television deals, but the money just isn't there.The Premier League has brought in more money than anyone has ever seen. The average salary of players in England's top division has climbed to a whopping $3.4 million per season, though Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo made more than $6.6 million during his first season in Spain. The wage gap between English and international stars, though, has been narrowing.One way to get more revenue is to sign players from elsewhere in the world. But that option is limited: For one thing, European clubs don't allow foreign players for free. For another, clubs in the Premier League would be competing against each other, which would make signing players from other leagues impossible. They would be giving up revenue. And if they were doing that, they wouldn't be playing the English game.So where can England go to put more money into its	0
Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karrubi has not been seen for six weeks and may be facing psychological torture by the government, activists claimed Monday, citing sources in the country. "We know of six men who are with Mehdi Karrubi in Iran," said the activists, who were not authorised to speak publicly.They said that they knew the whereabouts of Karrubi, who was a member of the country's opposition Green movement and the movement's leader during the late 1980s.Karrubi, who spent 23 years in prison and disappeared in 1995, is a leader in Iran's Green movement and has a large influence on opposition group. He led protests against the Islamic republic's disputed disputed election of June 2005, which is scheduled for next Saturday, April 29.A member of a government-sponsored organisation that works to train Islamic republic's youth told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that Karrubi was being held in a "concentration camp," adding that "if he is not released by March 21, we will go to his home and kill him."The opposition activist, who was not identified, said that he feared that Karrubi could be under "psychological torture."According to the activist, Karrubi has been taken from his home during the night to several detention centres. "They [authorities] told him he would be questioned in a few hours, and that the interrogations would not last more than 24 hours," he said.Karrubi "was not there for his interrogations — he was taken away in the night," the activist continued."If we go to him [Karrubi] after he is released, we will be shot, we will not get out alive," he added."The people who are with him want him to be released," he said.Karrubi was believed to have played a role in organizing the demonstrations on Friday as well as his public statements.He has been critical of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and his hardline conservative policies.Karrubi's family members have said that they are trying to free him, and that he has been on a hunger strike since January.On December 31, 2005, Karrubi was arrested on the charge of "spreading propaganda" against	0
It's not the most ambitious Kickstarter in history, but maybe that's the secret ingredient that's making one man's pitch on the crowd-funding website so successful. Well, maybe Â£6,000 is the secret ingredient that's making the "Wicked Game" concept so successful.Failed Kickstarter pitch videoTo be fair, he has a lot of competition this time round.Not just the usual crop of horror and fantasy game ideas: he's also putting on the cards one more "true-life" horror game called "Pitfall" which is a psychological horror game set in an asylum.So far, so good.There's even an all-star voice cast that includes actor Andrew Scott for "Wicked Game" writer Mark Stokes, and James McAvoy ("Star Wars" and "The Avengers") to star as his own version of The Joker.There's also a cast that includes Sam Neil (writer), Tony Todd (actress), Sean Astin (actor) and Tim Curry (pianist and opera singer).So who's behind "Wicked Game" ?Mark Stokes:"I've always wanted to do a horror game - especially as a teenager, but not quite knowing how it's done or where to start. So I've just done my own game, so to speak. "And Andrew Scott :"I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I agreed to play 'Wicked Game'. The concept of it didn't really seem like it would work, and I didn't really know how. "Finally, there's the "Pitfall" game which is about a bunch of different players trying to escape an asylum filled with crazies.The Pitfall's Kickstarter is set to launch in June 2016, and includes a $25 pledge level that will put you in the running to take part in the game.Here's how it's going to work...When you pledge, you could win a chance to attend the release of the game, so you have to hurry.There's also a $50 level that puts you in the running to win one of ten copies of the game."Wicked Game" is being told from a first person perspective which will offer a new way of telling horror stories using text and audio.	0
Gunmen who stormed an Iraqi university on Saturday used students as human shields and clashed with security forces, authorities said. Forces have surrounded al-Anbar University in the city of Ramadi and are attempting to retake the campus from the attackers. The campus is about 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of Baghdad. The gunmen are believed to be members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a rogue Sunni Muslim extremist group formerly affiliated with al Qaeda, also known by its acronym ISIS, police said. Approximately 1,200 students, professors and staff who live in the campus residential buildings were present during the attack; nearly 20 students were slightly injured, officials said. The majority of students were able to flee, but some are still inside, police officials told CNN. The Al-Anbar University attack comes amid a wave of violence that has taken Iraq by storm. Also Saturday, six roadside bombs exploded in the capital of Baghdad, killing at least 33 people and injuring 72 others, police officials said. The explosions occurred in a busy commercial Shiite neighborhood, targeting mostly civilians, police said. This year, Iraq has witnessed some of the worst violence since 2008. The United Nations reported that May was the deadliest month since the beginning of the year. The escalating violence in recent months has left hundreds dead, raising fears it could return Iraq to the level of violence in 2006 and 2007, when bodies littered the streets.	1
As the U.S. partial government shutdown continues into almost a third week, the stakes are growing. Of upmost concern is not a lengthy closure of the federal bureaucracy, but that Washington could default on its debt around October 17, unless the debt limit is raised by Congress. The impact of default could be catastrophic, and not just economically. As Secretary of State John Kerry asserts, this would send a message "of political silliness" that we "can't get our own act together" so we need to "get back on a track the world will respect." In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, President Barack Obama cancelled his important week-long trip to Asia to try to secure a breakthrough. Internationally, the spectacle of what is perceived as Washington's growing political dysfunction in recent years is as bemusing as it is alarming. And, according to some data, this is a driver behind a decline in the country's international reputation. For instance, the 2012-2013 FutureBrand Country Index shows a continued fall in the international ranking of the United States compared to other nations. Based on a sample of about 3,600 people in 18 countries, it concludes that the country is "in decline," partly because of "successive fiscal crises." This builds on earlier studies by the organization, including in 2011-12 which highlighted "intensified speculation about America's long-term stability," partly as a result of the downgrade by Standard & Poor's of the country's credit rating. This was prompted by the last near debt default of Washington in 2011. These findings on the U.S.'s reputation are echoed by the 2013 BBC Country Rating Survey, which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries, and also the 2013 Pew Global Study based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries. The BBC poll recorded a fall in positive views towards America for a second consecutive year, while the Pew survey found that pro-U.S. sentiment is slipping, after a strong bounce following Obama's election in 2008.	1
As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women. But her latest project is possibly her most ambitious Â— and controversial.This article first appeared in the August 2018 issue of Marie Claire magazine. Subscribe.At the end of last September, Rafia Ghubash Â— who is both an academic and an activist Â— announced that she was returning to the classroom after a successful two-year sabbatical. Her first order of business: A new book, a feminist perspective on science and math, that will challenge the conventional view of women in academia and also give a voice to Arab women.Her second order of business: She would like to take her ideas into the political sphere.Ghubash is co-founder of a think tank called Women in Science and Engineering for Global Challenges, or WISE-GC, a United Arab Emirates–based think tank that plans to focus its efforts and resources on the advancement and empowerment of women in science and technology, particularly in the United States. The organization began in 2015 and was given an initial funding of $10 million in December 2016, with additional funding, in its inaugural year, announced at the end of June 2017.The first initiative was the establishment of the Academic Leadership Development Program (ALDP), in partnership with the National Science Foundation. ALDP is intended to promote an environment that encourages students to pursue academic careers. It was the first WISE-GC program to feature and was led by three professors at the University of Texas–Austin, who had experienced some success with STEM education in the public schools.This was followed by two other new programs: the International Science and Technology Leadership Initiative (INSTEAD) and the International Center for Gender Equity and Women in Science (ICEGWISE).According to Ghubash, the objective of these initiatives is threefold: To increase the participation of women in science and engineering in the United Arab Emirate, to increase the funding and resources for women in STEM fields throughout the region, and to strengthen and diversify the science-and-technology sector both locally and internationally.What drew Ghubash to the United Arab Emirates in particular is her passion for science and technology, which she says she would have pursued even if she had not been raised in a family of scientists and engineers. “I	0
Crew members on a U.S.-flagged ship learned Friday that their questioning by Venezuelan investigators in an arms trafficking probe has been delayed until Monday. Venezuelan authorities have held the ship in Maracaibo since August 29, and took its captain into custody on Wednesday. The shipping vessel's crew had expected to give depositions on Friday, according to a crew member who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns. As of Friday night, prosecutors had yet to make a decision on the case, according to a manager of the ship's customs brokers. The manager asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The captain and crew members were all expected to give statements to investigators, the manager said. The crew member who asked to remain anonymous said there were 14 crew members on board, plus the captain. Divers and drug investigators were inspecting the ship, and the captain was expected to be returned to move the ship from the docks to an anchorage in Maracaibo Bay on Saturday morning, the manager said Friday night. The manager identified the captain as Jeffrey Michael Raider, 45, of Texas. The crew member who asked to remain anonymous said via e-mail Saturday night that the captain in fact had been returned to the ship to command it during its move to anchorage in the bay. The captain " is going back tonight. Every bit of news is speculative at this point," The crew member said in the Saturday night e-mail. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell on Friday confirmed the ship and crew's detention. "We understand this has to do with questions about customs paperwork for some rifles they had on board for self-protection," Ventrell told reporters. "We, of course, know that the high seas and that piracy have been a major topic in recent months and years, and so that's something we've been combating. And indeed, it's normal for many ships to have some type of self-defense on board." U.S. officials are seeking more information on the case, and Ventrell said that the absence of a U.S. ambassador in Venezuela isn't hampering the American response. U.S. President Barack Obama nominated an ambassador for Venezuela in 2010, but the Caracas government wouldn't allow him to assume the post.	1
It was a tale of two rulings -- the best of times and the worst of times for Obamacare in the federal appeals courts. First, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled Tuesday against a key component of the law -- the federal subsidies for millions of people who signed up for health coverage. The 2-1 decision created a legal path for a possible Supreme Court case that could essentially gut the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed with zero GOP votes. A few hours later, all three judges on a 4th Circuit panel in Virginia decided the opposite by declaring the subsidies legal and proper. What the court decisions mean for you Opposing rulings The opposing rulings increased the chances for the issue to reach the nation's highest court, and demonstrated the deep political divisions over the law despised by conservatives intent on undermining it. Both judges in the majority of the 2-1 D.C. Circuit ruling were appointed by Republican presidents, while all three in the unanimous 4th Circuit panel were appointed by Democratic presidents. Republicans immediately hailed the D.C. panel's ruling against the subsidies as evidence of what they called fatal flaws in the health care law. "This is yet more evidence that Obamacare is not working -- and cannot work -- for the American people," said GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who faces a conservative primary challenger questioning his right-wing credentials. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest expressed confidence in the administration's legal position, saying Congress clearly intended for all Americans to have access to tax credits if needed so they could afford health insurance. CNN Poll: Obama's numbers not great but holding steady The issue: subsidies The legal argument involves a provision in the health care law that says people who obtained coverage through state-run exchanges can get federal subsidies such as tax credits. It doesn't specifically say that those signing up on the federal exchange also are eligible. Opponents of the law contend that lack of specificity renders illegal the subsidies for anyone who enrolled through the federal exchange. Only 14 states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges, meaning that the 4.7 million who signed up for subsidized health coverage through HealthCare.gov could be affected. "It will kill Obamacare," Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said of an eventual Supreme Court ruling against the subsidies. "It would make it very difficult for Obamacare to continue because the cost of health care is going to go sky high for those who are not in the state exchange."	1
NASA says the Cassini spacecraft recorded the aftermath of a massive storm on Saturn that let out an "unprecedented belch of energy." Not only was the size of the storm unusual, but what the storm was made of left scientists puzzled. The source of the cosmic burp, which rapidly changed the atmosphere's temperature, was ethylene gas, an odorless, colorless gas that has rarely been observed on Saturn, NASA said. "This temperature spike is so extreme it's almost unbelievable," said Brigette Hesman, the study's lead author who works at Goddard. "To get a temperature change of the same scale on Earth, you'd be going from the depths of winter in Fairbanks, Alaska, to the height of summer in the Mojave Desert," Hesman said in a statement released by NASA. NASA's NuStar gets first look at black hole at the center of the Milky Way Scientists still haven't figured out from where the ethylene gas came. By comparison, a storm of similar size on Earth would cover North America from top to bottom and wrap the planet many times, researchers said. The Cassini spacecraft first detected the disruption on December 5, 2010, and has been following it since, but researchers said the ethylene gas disruption that followed the storm was unexpected. A storm this size happens once every 30 years, or once every Saturn year, NASA scientists said. Launched in 1997, the Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. A full report will be published in November's issue of the Astrophysical Journal. More news about outer space on CNN.com's Light Years blog	1
Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent  decline in net sales in the first quarter of 2003.  The company cited two factors for its disappointing first quarter.  First, it said that the business outlook for the second half of 2003 had not materialized as it had hoped.  Second, it said the business model it had been putting into place had not been effective in achieving its goal of achieving increased margins.Sales for the first quarter were $1.2 billion, down 85 percent from the first quarter of 2002.  Net income for the quarter was $29 million, or 3 cents per share, down from $50 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.  Despite its gloomy financial results, the company ended its first quarter with $3.1 billion in cash on hand.Sales for the year were $3.3 billion, down 68 percent from the year-earlier period, and down 70 percent from a year ago.  Net income for the year was $104 million, or 4 cents per share.  The company's analysts had expected net income of 4 cents per share.The company said that in the first quarter of 2003 it had $7.1 billion in long-term debt, down from $13.1 billion a year earlier.  At the end of this quarter, the company had $10.8 billion in long-term debt, a 62 percent increase from a year earlier.The company said that its loss of net revenue was largely due to a strong yen and an increased dollar cost of raw materials, offset by a recovery in sales from its overseas operations.The company stated, "After reviewing the business trends, we decided that it would be appropriate for us to implement business initiatives to improve our product quality and customer service, and to achieve increased margins even if the recovery in the business is slow. These initiatives, which had not been previously executed, have been executed successfully.""The financial results for the first quarter reflect these business initiatives, and are in line with the company's expectations for the year."Revenue for the first quarter represented a loss of $30 million and a loss of $5 million for the first quarter of the previous year, or a loss of 93 percent. Net income for the quarter was $50 million, or 5 cents per share, down from $87 million, or 8 cents	0
Saturday's downhill at Kitzbühel is the jewel in the World Cup calendar, the winner meriting legendary status in the alpine annals. Like any budding skier, Daniel Albrecht had always dreamed of  ski jumping, but it wasn't until he saw a TV advert for the Kitzbühel jump that sparked his interest. "I don't even remember what I was doing when I saw that advert," he said. "I was watching it as a kid. The skier was jumping with a ski-jump rope. It was incredible. I got very excited, and the more I saw of it, the more I got excited. I saw that video of him jumping, and I just thought, 'That man is fearless.'"Over the next few years, Albrecht began taking lessons in the sport. He took a chance and signed with a local ski school, only to quit after a month. After that, he turned for help to his uncle, a pilot and avid skier, and began competing at junior level in the Austrian Alps. His performance in the junior ski-flying competition at Kitzbühel, Austria, in 1992, earned him a spot at the junior World Cup that fall. Two years later, at the age of 18, he became the youngest person to ever qualify for the senior World Cup.In 1996, the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association added ski jumping to its program, and Albrecht moved to North Carolina to train for its World Cup, which began in March 1999. It was there that he won his first World Cup race, the U.S. FIS J-Cup, that spring. In four years, he never finished better than third. "It was very difficult to jump at that level," he said. "It was like training for the Olympics. To go through all the mistakes required in order to come out alive, it just wasn't an option."Albrecht had qualified for the 2000 Olympic Games on a team with a total of only six others. By that time, however, he had been a regular at the World Cup. In the 2000-2001 season, he was fifth in the overall standings. During the summer off-season, Albrecht took time out to train with the U.S. Ski Team at the Deer Valley Ski Resort, where he grew up. "I didn't come to Deer Valley to	0
Nicolas Cage's son is scheduled to be released from a Los Angeles hospital this weekend where he was treated while on a psychiatric hold after a violent incident outside a Hollywood restaurant Tuesday. But Weston Cage's mother, Christina Fulton, is asking his doctor to recommend her 20-year-old son be kept at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for another two weeks, she told CNN Friday. "I do not want him with Nicolas Cage," Fulton said. "I do not want him in that care. That is not the care my son needs." Fulton is suing Nicolas Cage over unpaid taxes and the Hollywood home where she raised their son, who court documents say suffers from "a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments." Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care. "I am an adult," Weston Cage said. "I don't want to have anything to do with my mother. Any problems that I have ever had is because of the relationship that I had with my mother." When Fulton heard the quote, she called it "an absolute disgrace" that the lawyer would solicit such a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold, deemed legally incompetent. "My son is under a spell, he's under a trance," Fulton said. "Weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say." Fulton blames Nicolas Cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and was no longer under her legal guardianship. "It's his dad's fault that he's in the hospital," Fulton said. "He had his chance. He had his chance to make it right. My son had a healthy environment here. He had a system that was fantastic. I built that with myself and my team." A member of that team of caregivers was Kevin Villegas, whom Fulton hired as her son's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school. She said she fired Villegas three years ago, but Nicolas Cage rehired him. Villegas is now under investigation for the brutal and public beating of Weston Cage on a Hollywood sidewalk Tuesday afternoon. Los Angeles detectives will present their findings to a prosecutor who will decide if Kevin Villegas, who was employed as Cage's trainer, will be charged, a police spokesman told CNN. CNN has been unable to contact Villegas for comment.	1
It may appear to be the height of bad taste: a collection of handguns clad in silver and studded with precious stones. But although these weapons, which were produced by Tiffany & Co in the late 19th Century, were able to deliver lethal force, they were never designed to be fired. "So far as we know, the guns never killed anybody," says Pierre Terjanian, the head of the Arms and Armor department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where a collection of seven such guns is kept. "They were produced to symbolize the potency of American manufacturing and craftsmanship, and were created using techniques that nobody else could equal." Guns not blazing Tiffany & Co had been producing decorative presentation swords that were awarded to American officers during the Civil War and Mexican-American War of 1846-8. In the 1880s, the company moved into firearms, taking delivery of standard-issue Smith & Wesson handguns and transforming them into one-off works of art. They were clad in silver, etched with intricate designs, and studded with precious jewels. Each weapon was unique; one was adorned with an American buffalo hunting scene, while others were inspired by Japanese or Islamic design. These formed the centerpiece of the American display at the World's Fair series of exhibitions, which started with the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace, London, in 1851, and then were held around Europe and the United States. "At the time, a great aura surrounded the Wild West in Europe," says Terjanian. "It was at the time of the closing of the frontier, and people were already thinking nostalgically about it. "Tiffany took Wild West symbolism and combined it with high-quality craftsmanship. It confirmed that Tiffany was an American firm with global ambitions, which could do things that nobody else could." Uniquely beautiful objects Among the techniques that the weapons showcased were advanced enameling -- two colors were blended together in a way that had never been seen before -- and the use of chemical etching, as opposed to straightforward engraving. Tiffany & Co also produced a Winchester rifle, which was famously used in the conquest of the West. Although it was technically able to fire bullets, the thick silver cladding made it impossible to disassemble and clean, and the heavy ebony wood made it too heavy to use effectively.	1
In an ever-evolving, increasingly crowded beverage market, Starbucks is waking up and smelling the coffee. The problem is it's not their house blend. "Here's a statistic that people are surprised by. Despite the long-term success that we've enjoyed, we have less than 10 percent share of coffee consumption in North America. And less [than] 1 percent share internationally," Starbucks Chairman, President and CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money. Advertising Age also recently pointed out that despite Starbucks being the world's largest coffeehouse chain with more than 13,000 locations in more than 50 countries, even its most devout customers purchase only three of every 10 cups of coffee they drink from Starbucks. So, who is stealing Starbucks' mojo? Folgers, a division of J.M. Smucker Co., is still the largest producer of retail packaged coffee in the United States. Its coffee brands include Folgers and Millstone, and it also manufactures and distributes Dunkin' Donuts coffee to sell in grocery stores. Then there is the other American coffee titan, Maxwell House, which is a Kraft Foods brand. Kraft reported soaring earnings in its 2010 first quarter, linking the growth to new advertising and innovation behind existing Kraft brands such as Maxwell House. This competition is stirring Starbucks to step up its home-brewed strategy, partially by adding some flavor. An AC Nielsen panel recently found that more than 11 percent of American households purchase flavored coffee for home use, making it a $265 million business in the United States. Starbucks Corp. will enter the fray in June when Starbucks Natural Fusions, in vanilla, caramel and cinnamon, arrives at grocery stores. Additionally, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by leaning on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's Best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points. Starbucks acquired its former competitor, Seattle's Best Coffee, seven years ago. "We are uniquely positioned to reach into these channels because of the brand equity and trust we build with the customers who come into our stores," Starbucks said in a statement to CNN. Seattle's Best, in part, will take aim against Starbucks' typically lower-priced, quick-service rivals such as McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. In a new rebranding effort, Starbucks plans to distribute the Seattle's Best brand in Burger King and Subway restaurants nationwide.	1
Two Los Angeles police officers were shot at Sunday night while they drove their patrol car in the southern part of the city, police said. The officers returned fire, authorities said, and no one was injured. One suspect was arrested and two weapons, including a rifle, were recovered. Another remains at large, prompting a manhunt that lasted for hours and involved about 100 officers, LAPD Capt. Lillian Carranza said. Police warned residents to stay indoors in part of South Central Los Angeles. On Monday, police reopened access to streets inside a six-block perimeter they set up overnight. LAPD Detective Megan Aguilar told CNN that investigators have "nothing to indicate that there's a nexus" between the shooting and recent nationwide protests against police brutality that have fueled animosity toward police. And there was a second incident over the weekend in which police were fired at, this one in Florida on Sunday morning. Someone fired three bullets at two deputies with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office as they sat in their patrol car. "Both deputies reported hearing the whizzing sound of each projectile as they flew by,"  the sheriff's office said. "Deputies did not see the suspect or the vehicle from which the shots were fired." Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay is offering a $3,000 reward for information leading to the person or persons who fired at the officers. Pasco County authorities are also searching for someone who spray-painted, "Shoot MP Cop" on a road barrier in Meadow Pointe, a subdivision. The latest incidents of shots fired at police come after New York police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down in their patrol car on December 20. The gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, then shot himself at a subway station. Earlier, he had posted angry messages on social media against police and government, citing the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two black men killed by police. On Saturday, more than 25,000 police officers from across the country and even Canada attended Ramos' funeral. Liu's funeral will be January 4. Rookie police officer killed in Arizona CNN's Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.	1
Call it Abu Dhabi's ivory tower. The 35-story white skyscraper stands tall overlooking the mangroves of this oil rich emirate which is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It was the venue for what was arguably the most important corporate press conference this year in the UAE. The subject at hand was the construction firm Arabtec. At the front of the room, board members who represent the "who's who" of Abu Dhabi trading families: Qubaisi, Fahim, Suwaidi and Mehari. The major backer of Arabtec is the state run investment group Aabar, which is one of the many funds controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Presidential Affairs, and the owner of, amongst other trophy assets, Manchester City Football Club. Until a month ago, this company was not on anybody's global radar, even though the Dubai-based group is well known around these parts. It has built the new global landmarks like the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, and the world's most expensive hotel to be constructed, the Emirates Palace. It is also busy putting up the Louvre Abu Dhabi, part of a $25 billion cultural district in the city. Interest inside and outside the country has been swirling around Arabtec and Dubai's stock exchange for the past month, especially after the market achieved an upgrade to MSCI's emerging market index in June. But with a global upgrade comes international scrutiny for a company and stock market that many fund managers say are falling short on both transparency and corporate governance. The press event was somewhat surreal. Players representing billions of dollars of investment trying to clear up how a former CEO Hasan Ismaik accumulated 28% of the stock without either the company or the Dubai Financial Market raising any red flags. An Arabic reporter I know was told before the press conference that we could all take our TV cameras in, but not have any audio. That idea was quickly dropped. Six board members were present, but Arabtec Chairman Khadem Al Qubaisi did all the talking during this hour long affair. What emerged was a man out to clear the air. He said Arabtec has not seen one project cancellation and that Arabtec will in future do what it does best and that is construction -- and not venture into oil and gas as the previous leadership had planned.	1
At least 10 people have died and thousands have been left homeless after torrential rains inundated large parts of Ecuador, officials said Thursday. Authorities said the rains, which began a week ago, were the worst in a quarter century. Civil defense officials said more than 10,000 families have been affected. Los Ríos -- north of Guayaquil -- was the hardest hit of nine provinces affected, civil defense officials said. In Los Ríos province, five people died when an ambulance drove into a hole at the side of a street at dawn Thursday. A newborn boy, his parents, a doctor and a driver were killed. Streets also were flooded in the capital of Quito.  Watch the scenes of devastation in Ecuador » On Wednesday, President Rafael Correa declared a state of emergency and ordered 2,000 members of the army and the police to help rescue workers. Correa increased by $25 million the $10 million he already had allocated for the emergency efforts. He also directed another $88 million to municipalities. Once the crisis has eased, an emergency fund will give seed and fertilizer to help farmers whose fields were washed away, Ecuador's government said. There also have been reports of livestock drowning. Cristina Medina, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean Red Cross, said provinces most heavily affected were along the Pacific coast, where drinking water was often in short supply. In some towns, high waters forced entire neighborhoods to evacuate, Medina said. E-mail to a friend	1
Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor. The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker  government announced the shipment on Saturday, after Israel denied a request on the grounds that it could endanger the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty with the United States.Israel says the ships, part of a military arms delivery mission to Egypt from its former sponsor Iran, will be escorted by Israeli ships. The US has called the plan "foolish."The ships are expected to dock in the Red Sea port of Eritrea, which has been a long-running source of tension between the countries owing to the longstanding dispute over a territorial border demarcated by the British but no longer recognized by the US and Israel.The first vessel is expected to arrive in Eritrea on August 1. The second ship is also believed to be due to make the trip before the end of the year. According to a statement by the Egyptian foreign ministry, the vessels will arrive two days after the United Arab Emirates.The countries have long claimed ownership of the canal and fought wars that resulted in a large number of casualties.Eritrea has repeatedly challenged Israel's territorial claims and Egypt's control over the canal. As a result, the two sides have frozen the flow of ships through the canal.The two warships' arrival is being closely watched by the US, which had earlier sent a naval escort to prevent the Iranian ships from sailing to the Sinai Peninsula and from being used for terrorist attacks.On Saturday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Israel was "right in denying" the request. He called the plan "unacceptable" and added that it "could undermine the viability of a two-state solution," a reference to the process of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which the US supports. The White House is seeking to maintain the existing policy of "unimpeded trade and diplomatic relations" with Israel and does not want the two nations to start a trade war or to create a situation where they have to choose whether to make peace.Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government, which began  its 17-month-old term after Mubarak was forced to step down by the Egyptian people on February 11, is due to be replaced by an interim government.However, the interim government is	0
Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. El-Sisi's recent presidential bid reveals a tenacious attempt of the Egyptian military to consolidate power and preclude Egyptians' aspirations of having a genuine democracy. For the past few months, the Egyptian media and state institutions have been ardently working to pave the way for el-Sisi's presidency by distorting and smearing his political opponents. Over the past six decades, the Egyptian military has implanted its officers and generals in almost every aspect of civilian life from pasta and soap factories to the construction of soccer stadiums, bridges and infrastructure. Through such practices the army has successfully extended its control over the country. Consequently, the "militarization" of the Egyptian state, which was entrenched under Mubarak -- who systematically co-opted and spoiled military high-rank officers -- has weakened public institutions and created a feeble and fragmented political class that is now supporting the military's takeover. Gulf allies With regional support mainly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fervently seek to abort the Arab Spring, el-Sisi believes that he can suppress and tame the mounting anger and frustration among young Egyptians particularly Islamists who protest almost daily. By pouring billions of dollars into Egypt's economy, the Saudis and Emiratis believe that they can appropriate the Egyptian army and use it as a Trojan horse in order to eliminate and crush Islamists. Indeed, el-Sisi's Gulf counterparts view him as a "savior" not only from Islamists but more importantly from the very existential threat to their thrones: democracy. Thus it is not surprising that both, el-Sisi and his Gulf allies, share the same authoritarian mindset and behavior. They desperately seek to restore Mubarak's ruling-style with a new face. Surprisingly, or maybe not, the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in Egypt while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario. 'Stability vs. democracy' Moreover, despite the many instances of violations of human rights and the killing of civilians in the absence of any justice or accountability, the world powers have done nothing to stop such repulsive actions. The U.S. and the EU have failed miserably in pressuring the military to separate itself from politics and return to the barracks.	1
A new lawsuit alleges that convicted swindler Bernie Madoff financed a cocaine-fueled work environment and a "culture of sexual deviance," and he diverted money to his London, England, office when he believed federal authorities were closing in Lawyers acting on behalf of a former assistant to the chairman of investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert LLP claim Madoff used his London office to pay for a seedy, cocaine-fueled environment.The former assistant, Richard F. Griffin, Jr., claims that Madoff used his office to pay for cocaine as well as for sex for women who worked in his office.Drexel, in turn, claims Griffin was a disgruntled employee who left a violent note on Madoff's desk and asked for a job as well as a pay raise.The suit, filed Friday in Manhattan federal court, was brought by a class-action lawyer who represents investors who lost money to Madoff during his 20-year career at the firm.The suit accuses Madoff of defrauding the hedge fund's investors of a total of $69 billion -- most of it in the form of losses suffered by the firm's clients and others.The suit was filed on behalf of investors who lost money, alleging Madoff was able to make a fortune swindling investors out of their money.One of the biggest cases in the history of the United States' financial fraud laws involves Bernie Madoff, the swindler behind the largest financial fraud in history.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says Madoff defrauded investors of $50 billion in total by fabricating the investment histories of his clients to make them appear more lucrative.In exchange for the money, Madoff reportedly told his investors they would not only be able to beat the markets but also earn the same returns without risking a single cent of their money.On Tuesday, Madoff was arraigned in a federal court in New York and charged with 12 counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy and falsifying records.He pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has not been set.Among those speaking at the arraignment was Madoff's sister, Evelyn."I am saddened that those who are responsible for fraud have not been held accountable in a more traditional manner," Evelyn Madoff said.The New York Times reports that Madoff	0
U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz's planned visit to India next week has been delayed, an Energy Department official said Wednesday. The postponement of the trip comes amid tensions between New Delhi and Washington over the nuclear deal, which the U.S. Energy Department has criticized for potentially giving India a competitive edge in the world's fastest growing power market.While Moniz is slated to arrive in India from Jan. 19, the visit has been pushed back several times since his last trip in November.The move to delay Moniz's visit is unusual in that it comes just weeks before a key meeting between a top U.S. trade official and Indian trade officials.Talks are under way at Energy Department headquarters in Washington over U.S. trade barriers and concerns about the nuclear deal.The State Department's top official at that meeting is the top U.S. diplomat for South Asia. The official, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record on the issue, is scheduled to meet with India's high commissioner for trade and investment at a top U.S. trade official's office in Washington on Oct. 3.The delay to Moniz's visit could reflect the U.S. trade dispute with India. Moniz had been scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his commerce minister last month in Washington. But an Indian government official said last week that Moniz's trip to India next week was too risky because a nuclear agreement with India is dependent on U.S. support.Indian Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Joshi said in October that an agreement with the U.S. on trading in nuclear technologies was likely in a matter of days.Moniz's trip, and the U.S. trade dispute with India, are likely to be major issues discussed during the Oct. 3 meeting between the U.S. trade official and India's high commissioner for trade and investment. The high commissioner, whose office is based in New Delhi, will be meeting with other officials including the Indian commerce ministry's top trade official.There are also concerns in U.S.-India relations over the nuclear deal, which the U.S. Energy Department has criticized for potentially giving India a competitive edge in the world's fastest growing power market.If Moniz arrives in India next week, he will be greeted by the country's prime minister and finance minister. It will be the first meeting between the U.	0
Kang Min Kyu, 52, taught ethics. Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry. Just two days after the accident, he was found dead after apparently hanging himself using a  nylon rope tied around his neck. A suicide note included in his belongings on June 8 stated that he was being pressured to resign.Kang was the first senior educator to be found dead since the sinking of the Sewol ferry in early April (See The Sewol: 'the biggest mystery of our times' here.) The reason for his suicide has not been made public.His suicide followed a pattern of what happened to teachers, the first being the late Shin Dong-hyuk who was found hanged by high school student friends on December 12, 1993 after becoming depressed about his job. Another example of teachers committing suicide is when a former teacher (Jo Sung-ha) killed himself by jumping on his own roof on June 19, 2000 (See Shin Dong-hyuk and another 'hanging himself in a public place in South Korea' here.)There are about a dozen active cases of suspected suicides of teachers in South Korea each year but these are not properly investigated and few teachers have died. The latest case to make headlines was that of Han Gyo-hyung, 46, a teacher at Daegu National University (See Han Gyo-hyung: the teacher with the brain scan problem here.) But his case was not widely noted and media attention has been given to the case of Kang Min Kyu.Kang Min Kyu, who taught ethics to high school students, was found dead with a nylon rope around his neck in a public place in Ansan on June 8 (AFP Photo/A. YURI GOSKA)Kang was found about a week after the death of an 18-year-old student, Myung-ok, who was found dead the week before (See The Sewol: 'the biggest mystery of our times' here.) It has been suggested that her death may in fact be a suicide, as her death was linked to the stress of her father's divorce.It should also be remembered that before Kang's suicide, the first suicide of a high school teacher happened on June 7, 1993 (See Shin Dong-hyuk and another 'hanging himself in a public place in South	0
The legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the inspiration behind an ambitious plan to grow a rooftop forest high above Beirut's crowded streets. The cityscape is currently overshadowed by concrete highrises, with parkland making up just 3% of Lebanon's capital, according to a study by the American University of Beirut. The lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat, among a host of other environmental issues, claims architect Wassim Melki. This led him to the the unconventional idea of greening over the city's rooftops. "We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees," said Melki. Challenging though it sounds, Melki's proposal does not involve complicated drainage systems or engineering. "We're just talking about planting small to medium-sized trees in relatively large pots and securing them to the roofs," he added. The 28-year-old architect claims there are 15,000 suitable rooftops -- around 80% of those in the city. "Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said. With colleagues at local NGO ReAct, Melki aims to plant 60,000 trees eventually. They say that as well as making a sizable dent in the level of carbon dioxide in the air, the trees would also create a rooftop canopy, casting shadows on the streets and helping to keep the city cool. Nevertheless, Wonder Forest, if realized, would not be comparable to a public park. "Planting trees in the ground is always preferable, and nothing can replace a wide open space to walk through," said Melki. Comment: Would you give the scheme your support? Is the Wonder Forest project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page. Ultimately though, the success of the idea is in the hands of Beirut's residents -- who would need to tend the gardens, particularly over the hot summer months. "Even if all the trees and their installation is provided, if the residents don't subsequently get involved, then the plan will fail," said Melki.	1
Its boss the butt of late-night jokes and its conduct the target of President Barack Obama's ire, BP went into a June meeting at the White House with its future at stake. "The confidence of the markets had been rattled," former BP CEO Tony Hayward said in his first interview since he resigned, indicating how close the company was to collapse. Oil was still flowing from its well in the Gulf of Mexico and the company was being hit financially on all sides, with its stock price down and demands increasing for it to suspend dividend payments. Eleven lives had been lost on the Deepwater Horizon rig and Gulf Coast residents were feeling the punch of the disaster. "These were frightening days," current boss Bob Dudley told the BBC, which aired "BP: $30 Billion Blowout" on Tuesday. "It was a very, very tense period." BP emerged from the White House with an agreement to spend $20 billion in reparations over four years and for politicians to tone down the anti-BP rhetoric. Hayward told the BBC the company was "not prepared" for the fallout from the spill and that he understood why he was "demonized and vilified" by the American public. "It is very difficult to hate a company," said Hayward, conceding BP contingency plans were inadequate. "It's much easier to hate an individual." Hayward made a series of ill-advised remarks during the crisis, including, "I would like my life back." U.S. politicians and officials castigated him and occasionally referred to the company as "British Petroleum" rather than as "BP," underscoring that a foreign-based company was at fault for the disaster. "I don't feel like I've been made a scapegoat, I recognized the realities of the world we live in," Hayward told the BBC. "In some senses it comes with the patch and you simply have to take the rough with the smooth." Hayward said the company can restore the environment and jobs, but not the lives of those who died on the Deepwater Horizon. "I was and remain devastated, he said. "I feel a real accountability for that." The BBC program was aired on the second day of U.S. hearings about the Gulf oil spill. One bad decision after another, failed tests and other shortfalls show that the three companies involved in the disaster need to be overhauled, the co-chairman of the presidential commission investigating the incident said.	1
Rescuers have saved more than 50 whales and five dolphins that stranded themselves on a beach in Tasmania, officials said Ã¢â?¹?There were no reports of injuries.Ã¢â?¹?On the bright side, the rescue mission got a $10,000 donation from the owner of the local pub, who donated the money because "he is a great supporter of education and this community", the news release adds.The pub donated it to the "Save Our Whales" campaign, and the owner used the money to make a "good will gesture"."The generous donation will be reallocated to the Save Our Whales campaign to help increase awareness and funding for our marine conservation efforts worldwide," the release states.In fact, the pub's owner has donated $10,000 more to the Save Our Whales campaign, "to further benefit all marine conservation, education and research efforts from the pubÃ¢â?¬â?, the news release adds.Now, if an ocean full of whales had tried to break in to the nearest pub, we might be talking about a little bit of a struggle.

It's time this debate was settled once and for all. Football or soccer? What do you think the round-ball game should be called? While it may be a basic discussion; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called "football" or  "soccer" may be more important than discussing the origins of the games, or the reasons for the word which are often called "American."FootballSo, let's talk about football. If the term "American Football" is what you prefer, fine. If the term "American Football" is what you don't like, fine, too. Let's talk about the game. What's the difference between American Football and Football? You tell me. And what do we call the game in America?To start, everyone has heard of American football. That's how we got the word. And most people know the term "football" is from the Latin "fúlcus" which, in turn, is a shortening of the German "Fußball" or "Ball Game."FúlcusGerman Fußball which, as you may have guessed by the shortening, was a game played between the Germans and the British during World War I. The game involved soccer players who had to kick a red ball into a goal, and the soccer term "Fußball" in turn is a German word for a soccer ball. The origin of the word Fußball is disputed, and most educated sources claim that German-speaking teams of the World War I era used "Fußball" as a shortened version of "Baseball", which was another German word for soccer.As the word Fußball came into English in 1914, an English professor in Baltimore wrote to a colleague:FootballSo, let's talk about football, the modern football game. The game is played by thirteen players on a field with thirteen players. The players wear jerseys with their names on the back, and the jerseys also have a number on the back, and the jerseys have stripes and stars around the sleeve and neck. The most important player on the field is the quarterback. The quarterback snaps the ball while on the ball, and when the quarterback releases the ball, five other players on the opposing team, called the receivers, attempt to catch the football, with the quarterback attempting to make the receivers tackle him.When it's all said and done,	0
Tensions spiked in the Middle East on Tuesday as Iran extolled its "axis of resistance" with Syria, and the United States warned of proxy and terror activity. Saeed Jalili, a top Iranian official meeting with Syrian President Bashar ˙ Assad in Damascus, said that the "axis of resistance" extends far beyond the two countries and that Tehran "will not abandon Syria in any circumstances." The Syrian Foreign Ministry called the statement an "offense" towards Damascus and "a flagrant violation" of the status quo.The statement went on to call for the "full liberation of all Syria from colonialism and interference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and to defend the Palestinian Cause, a cause of the people of Syria and the Arab World, against all attempts by the occupier to make Syria and the Arab World into another Iraq or another Afghanistan."The statement said that the "axis of resistance" would defend Syria and Palestine against Israeli aggression, and would "dare any power to try to undermine the Arab solidarity between the Palestinian and Syrian peoples and the unity of Arab unity."However, it also seemed to threaten regional instability: "It is very important for stability, security and peace to the region that the Palestinian cause be defended and that the Palestinian people be given their legitimate rights [to return to their homeland]," the statement said. "This will not be realized until the Arab states are strong and united."It called on the Palestinian people to confront the Israeli occupation and to "take the struggle to its logical conclusion and achieve the liberation of all Palestine. The Palestinian cause will be achieved by the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as the capital, living side by side with the Arab state.""The Palestinians must organize and unify the resistance of the Palestinian people to establish a Palestinian state," the statement said. "It is important to highlight that all Palestinian political and legal options have been exhausted."President Trump has also warned that Iran is not going to take the world by surprise. When the president told reporters that Iran's "not going to take the world by surprise" and "will not endure the world's indifference," he was referring to a report in the New York Times that claimed that there was a secret Iranian fleet of submarines and other sea-based vessels.The New York Times report was quickly dismissed by Secretary Pompeo and top US officials.The US State Department also released a statement Tuesday	0
Japan began dumping thousands of tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean on Monday, an emergency move officials said was needed to curtail a worse leak from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In all, about ʹ5,700 tonnes of contaminated water will be poured into sea in at the moment of maximum concentration in the main tank of the idled Daiichi plant, said Tokyo Electric Power Co.But on the same day, a third Fukushima facility was ordered to turn off its reactors after a fourth, the Takaki-1 plant, was shut down. A spokesman for Tokyo Electric said Takaki-1 was one of the three most radioactive, and the other two were Daiichi. He said the Takaki-1 plant's containment vessel and reactor core had been safely depressurized. He said it would continue to be monitored continuously, and that the plant's safety was being checked again Tuesday.Japan's nuclear chief, Yuichiro Kakuta, said the third plant was not affected by the radiation leak at Daiichi; Kakuta also said there were still a little more than one month's worth of fuel rods at the Daiichi plant. He said that with the reactor core and the containment vessel turned off now, "we can safely and effectively use this situation in our everyday operations."A spokesman for Tokyo Electric said the Takaki-1 plant would be shut down and its staff would work without the reactor's cooling waters, which kept the cores cool. It would keep the reactor cool using its steam. It would not be able to restart the reactor.Some in Japan are saying this will be the worst disaster since Chernobyl, an event in which about a dozen reactors were damaged and four spewed radioactive and other waste into the atmosphere in 1986.While I don't agree that Chernobyl is the worst nuclear accident, I do agree that Japan's ongoing and near-term nuclear power plants aren't safe. I just wish that someone at some level was willing to accept some sort of liability for the risks caused by these plants to the public as well as the environment.I think that the public are more concerned about the safety of food and water than the safety of the reactors themselves so the public, when polls say it is safe to go to the reactor now, will continue to go for the next few days.I agree with this. The only thing I am wondering about is water. This story looks very	0
Texas Gov. Rick Perry will immediately send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to help secure the southern border, where tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America have crossed into the United States this year in a surge that is deemed a humanitarian crisis. Perry also wants President Barack Obama and Congress to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol agents for the Texas border, which would eventually replace the temporary guard forces. "I will not stand idly by," Perry said in Austin Monday, announcing what he called Operation Strong Safety. "The price of inaction is too high." Perry's state has received the majority of migrant children, especially in the Rio Grande region, and he has repeatedly called on the federal government to beef up border security. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House has not yet received the formal communication required for Perry to deploy guard troops. But he said if Perry follows through, he hopes those forces would be coordinated "with the significant ongoing efforts already in place." On border crisis, Jeb Bush, Rubio and Perry remake image The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing. It currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, which equates to 5.4 agents per mile. The Tucson sector, for instance, has approximately 15.7 agents per mile. Both Perry and Obama have the authority to deploy National Guard troops, but whoever authorizes it has to pay for it. The deployment at Perry's direction means Texas will have to pick up the price tag of $12 million per month. One border sheriff, Omar Lucio of Cameron County, said he is skeptical of Perry's plan. "At this time, a lot of people do things for political reasons. I don't know that it helps," he told the Dallas Morning News. Conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and Perry has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began. Is the immigration crisis Rick Perry's second act? The potential 2016 presidential candidate previewed his plan in Iowa over the weekend in a television interview while campaigning for Republican candidates. He has used the issue to remake his image on immigration. His previous White House campaign was crippled partly because of a law he signed giving children of undocumented immigrants in-state college tuition.	1
The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team. This illustration represents the transformation of a patient who underwent a near-total face transplant in December. The patient, who prefers to be anonymous, is finally able to breathe through her nose, smell, eat solid foods and drink out of a cup, Siemionow told participants of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago over the weekend. The complex surgery, a 22-hour procedure, took place in December at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver. "I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world," Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant » The patient had previously "suffered severe facial trauma," the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said. The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said. Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the "common world," but she is facing her family, the surgeon said. The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the "things we take for granted every day," Siemionow said. The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves. As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. "At this point, no one is really looking at beautification," she said. Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.	1
Take one dentist, a catsuit, a horse and a barrel, and you have a world champion. Four days a week, 25-year-old Joanne Eccles examines teeth in Kinross, north of Edinburgh. She spends the rest of her time clad in spandex, performing gymnastics on a horse. Her sport? Vaulting. The British rider is the favorite for August's World Equestrian Games, having won world titles in 2010 and 2012. "I've been vaulting since I was eight. After that, everything had to fit around it," she says. "I'm maybe not quite so enthusiastic about being a dentist, but I can earn a living and still get the most out of my vaulting." Here are the basics: you get on a moving horse and perform leaps, handstands, tumbles and other acrobatic moves on the animal's back, while it canters in a circle. You can compete as an individual (where Eccles excels), as a pair (the "pas de deux") or as a team of six. Men and women of all ages can compete together. Eccles sometimes performs with her 22-year-old sister Hannah, who has also represented Britain. "I still get to throw my little sister around, it's brilliant," she says. Even her father, John, is involved. He is Joanne's "lunger" -- which means his job is to guide the horse from the center of the arena while she competes. Lunging is an important job: when vaulters win medals, the lunger gets one, too. (The horse, meanwhile, must settle for everyone's lasting gratitude.) "The lunger is in constant contact and communication with the horse," explains Craig Coburn, a leading vaulting judge. "You have to work to keep the horse's pace and tempo, keep it paying attention to what's going on." Eccles says her dad was less than impressed as a spectator at her early domestic competitions. "He thought it was so boring," she recalls. "But then I was the reserve for a big international event, and he realized that if you're at a high level, it's a brilliant sport. "So he looked into getting a horse himself, he got into it, and now he's a coach and judge as well as my lunger."	1
A month after carrying out one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, federal authorities have added charges and broadened their case against the defendants. The 90-page superseding indictment, which was returned Thursday in the Eastern District of Virginia, adds counts of criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud against Megaupload.com and Megavideo.com. The websites were shut and several of their alleged leaders were arrested in January. The defendants allegedly reproduced copyrighted works from third-party websites, including from YouTube.com, so that they could be copied and distributed via Megavideo.com and to give the false impression that the website hosted content that was primarily generated by users and was not copyright-infringing content, the indictment says. "In contrast to legitimate Internet distributors of copyrighted content, Megaupload.com does not make any significant payments to the copyright owners of the many thousands of works that are willfully reproduced and distributed on he Mega Sites each and every day," the government says. In addition, the document says that the defendants' claim of more than 180 million registered users is not supported by their own records, which show only 66.6 million registered users as of January 19. Those records also show that just 5.86 million of these users ever uploaded a file to Megaupload.com or Megavideo.com, meaning that more than 90% of the sites' registered users used the systems solely to download, it says. Among those indicted is Kim Dotcom, the founder of Megaupload. His lawyer said after the initial indictment that his client is innocent, a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand. Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand, where he employs more than 50 staff, and Hong Kong, where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The superseding indictment cited the case of one alleged infringer referred identified only as "VV." Over six years, VV had uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, which resulted in more than 334 million views, it said. Though VV had been the subject of numerous takedown e-mails, none of those files had been deleted, it said. The government also added property, bank accounts, jet skis, jewelry and watches to the list of assets subject to forfeiture, and estimated the value at at least $175 million.	1
The Republicans appear to think North Carolina has the answer to their latest conundrum: how to sidestep growing calls for extending unemployment benefits for the 1.3 million Americans who depend on them without looking like uncompassionate conservatives. A measure to renew Emergency Unemployment Compensation died in this Senate last week and it's unclear, given that Congress must now focus on a spending bill, when senators will revisit the bill. Last year, North Carolina's jobless rate fell to a five-year low after Gov. Pat McCrory and the Republican-controlled legislature slashed unemployment benefits. The reason for this, wrote Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, is that unemployment is "intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits." "If the unemployed have a source of income," she wrote in Politico, "they are more likely to turn down lower-paying jobs -- even though they are losing job skills by remaining out of the labor force. The longer the unemployed are out of work, the more their skills atrophy. It is a vicious cycle leading to more long-term unemployment, a characteristic of this recession." This formulation achieves two things. One, it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension: Jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work. Two, it provides a moral rationale: Discontinuing jobless insurance is the right thing to do. As U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, noted in the Lexington Herald-Leader: "You could argue that conservatives who argue for shorter unemployment benefits actually have more concern for the worker than liberals who believe in no limits. Conservatives want to get every able-bodied person back into the work force." While there's little doubt that Paul wants "every able-bodied person back in the work force," there is ample reason to believe he and others have it upside down and backward. Jobless insurance isn't a cause of unemployment. That's caused by an economy that, on its own, would take more than seven years, by one estimate, to return to pre-2008 levels. What's more, Paul's clumsy attempt to retake the moral high ground reflects another puzzle that no Republican or Democrat has thus far faced: How can we continue to promote the values of freedom, hard work and self-reliance when even a full-time job isn't enough to get by?	1
The protests that have spread through parts of the Arab world led to dramatic change in another country Tuesday, as Jordan's king dismissed his government. King Abdullah II made the decision following protests in recent weeks in which several thousand people demanded economic and political reforms. Experts on the region said Tuesday Abdullah's decision was aimed at warding off larger-scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in Tunisia and Egypt.  The Tunisia protests, which began the movement, toppled that country's government.  In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak has fired his Cabinet, but protesters in massive demonstrations continue to call for his ouster. The protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan -- have proved to be "a real watershed event for the Arab world," said Blake Hounshell, managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine.  "It's really unprecedented." There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  A 2005 uprising in Lebanon was about independence and ousting Syria.  While it was successful, the revolution's message was not one that other nations associated with, he said. "It's different this time.  People are standing up for their economic rights, their dignity. It's very different," said Hokayem. Ibrahim Sharqieh of the Brookings Institution said there's a whole new mind-set. "The Tunisian uprising has caused change in the attitude and behavior of ordinary Arab citizens -- and today we are witnessing the emergence of a can-do nation attitude," he explained. Economic concerns have fueled the protests across the region.  At a speech Tuesday in Singapore, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the need for action against unemployment was "a strong undercurrent of the political turmoil in Tunisia, and of rising social strains in other countries," according to his prepared remarks. Arab leaders have been getting the message, Hokayem said, noting an article in the Wall Street Journal in which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said leaders must "see the need of reform" before protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia break out, because by then "it's too late to do any reform." Abdullah's decision and Assad's remarks "are preventive moves," said Hokayem.	1
Most New Yorkers and visitors to Times Square know of The Naked Cowboy. The Naked Cowboy is part of the scenery at New York City's Times Square. For the past 10 years, he's the guy you've seen on the sidewalk, with the iced tea, waiting for the movie to begin.But in the city, you can't just turn on the TV and see the Naked Cowboy; you have to go to Times Square. And that's when you find the greatest place in the world.The Times Square that I saw on Saturday was a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal. It was not like the Times Square on my way to and from the airport. I knew immediately that Times Square was different because of the Naked Cowboy. At this time on Saturday afternoon, the Naked Cowboy was walking toward Times Square in the direction of the theaters. He was wearing a tight pair of black trunks with black shoes. The trunks had a drawstring around them and were black with red trim around the waist and sides.The Naked Cowboy was about 5 feet tall. He had a long red beard and was bald. He was dressed in black and had white bandages on his legs. I don't know if he had a cane, but he did have short, black pointed-toe black shoes. He was walking through Times Square, headed toward the theaters. As he moved down the sidewalk toward the theater entrance, he looked up, winked at the crowd and then walked right in.The movie was "An Officer and a Gentleman" starring Colin Firth. It is about a retired British army officer and his life in London. Colin Firth is tall and slim. He has gray hair. He's wearing a very loud white shirt and a very loud dark brown blazer over a very loud blue shirt. He's walking down the street with a very loud black cane, which he holds in the air. He has black shoes with an inch heel. He's about 6 feet tall.He was wearing a very loud dark red hat and sunglasses.You have to see it to believe it. And you never get the chance. The Naked Cowboy is your main draw at Times Square on Saturday afternoon (unless you're at the theater, in which case the Naked Cowboy is the main draw). His walk is like a cross between the walk of a man who just had a stroke and the walk of a madman. But he is in	0
In the blink of an eye, Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States, soaring in recent days to a market value of $18.2 billion. That's bigger than Hertz and Avis combined. But is the Uber story  bigger than the story of the technology industry? Does it really matter?Advertisement:The tech industry has its self-serving narrative of growth in size, power and profit. Uber and its growing army of employees, drivers and investors are the ultimate proof of this narrative. Uber is now valued at $18.2 billion, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of all 48 contiguous U.S. states. What does this actually mean for the future of Uber's business? What does it mean for the future of the rest of the Internet as we know it? And, more importantly, what does it mean for our future as a society?If Uber is not your typical Silicon Valley startup, then why is Uber worth nearly $50 billion? And could all this be achieved without a single person in this world owning a smartphone?In the past, it mattered to the narrative of the tech industry whether or not a particular company met profitability and market valuation benchmarks. These benchmarks were the magic bullet that would demonstrate the success of the company and its ability to drive massive growth in its market value. They were always somewhat self-serving. The market, in its infinite wisdom, would simply find that magical number, regardless of any other metrics.Advertisement:But today's economy is different. In the past, the world would simply look to Silicon Valley tech companies, like Google and, to a lesser extent, Facebook , to develop the next hot tech innovation and thereby demonstrate their technological superiority.Now, technology and technology companies like Uber and Airbnb have become the keystones on the edifice of their respective industries. They are in the same financial stratosphere as any company in the entire world. They don't need any other incentive for their continued growth and success.Advertisement:This fact of the rise of both Uber and Airbnb demonstrates the power of the technology industry to leverage its own financial power to its advantage. In effect, the market has decided that the technology industry is no longer just the only business in America. It is the only business worth talking about and worth participating in.For anyone living in the United States, it	0
An airline is investigating the removal of two imams from a flight headed to North Carolina, ostensibly because passengers felt uncomfortable with their presence of the pair -- both clad in Islamic attire. The incident occurred Friday on an Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight from Tennessee to North Carolina and it involved Masudur Rahman and Mohamed Zaghloul were wearing traditional Muslim dress, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. The two -- who hold high religious positions in the Muslim community -- were headed to North Carolina for a conference on prejudice against Muslims, or Islamaphobia. The meeting is sponsored by the North American Imams Federation. Rahman, who is a professor at the University of Memphis, told the affiliate that the incident reminded him of the prejudice Rosa Parks faced during the civil rights movement. "That history I found today in that plane, and it shouldn't happen with any other person," he said. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, which operated the flight, said the incident is under investigation, and apologized "for any inconvenience that this may have caused." Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN the two men contacted his office and said they were told that passengers were uncomfortable with them on the flight. "They went through security, even went through secondary security, and got on the plane, were taxiing out," he said. But then, they were taxied back, Hooper said. "TSA came on and pulled them off and said the pilot was refusing to fly with them because passengers were uncomfortable with them," Hooper said, referring to the Transportation Security Administration. Hooper said officials re-screened them and found they were no threat. While officials tried to get the men back on the plane, "the pilot absolutely refused and ultimately took off," Hooper said. The airlines did not say why the two men were taken off the flight, but said they were given the opportunity to fly on a different flight. "Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion," the statement said. "We take security and safety very seriously, and the event is currently under investigation." CNN's Rick Martin, Craig Bell and Maria Ebrahimji contributed to this report.	1
At least 16 people were killed and 22 injured when a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden car detonated near a car dealership in a town northeast of Baghdad, police said. Balad Ruz is a mixed town of Arab, Kurd and Turkmen residents, located in Diyala province. Violence was also reported in Baghdad, where shootings and explosions were blamed for six deaths and injuries to more than 20 others, police in the capital said.	1
Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes. The 61-year-old retired construction supervisor lives in Bogota, Tennessee, a farming community so small that when asked how to find the town, locals respond, "Don't  even try."At first glance, Hayes has nothing in common with Colombia's capital city. The white-haired man is short and stout, with a gray beard and a shock of silver hair.Yet the two are not unrelated. Despite the town's rural setting, which is also home to people with a history similar to that of the Irish potato farmer, Hayes was born, he says, in Colombia in the 1960s.His father, he says, was a farmer who, "like me, had a lot of ideas for development that he believed in. We went to work like any other American family, and we put up a barn and barns, and we built roads and highways, and we developed the dairy industry...."Hayes' parents decided to move the family to Tennessee so that his father could get a job building houses, after his father saw in an ad in a newspaper for an engineer looking for work.Danny Hayes' parents sold their house in Colombian.

The move was a happy one for Danny Hayes."Our family was just like all the other American families that had just taken off," he says. His parents did not speak much English, "and in Colombia, our language was Spanish only."Hayes attended North Park Country School and graduated in 1969. In 1968, at the age of 18, he served in Vietnam, earning a bronze star for valor after helping to save the life of a fellow soldier.

For Gary Oppenheimer, 2007 was a year of plenty. His backyard garden produced a bountiful harvest with a surplus of spaghetti squash, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers for his family. At the end of the  year he decided to make a video, for the first time since his high school days, of friends, neighbors and family cooking a gourmet meal together. He thought it would appeal to everyone and that it would help bring the community together.But as people saw the video they were not exactly impressed, one neighbor called it “very corny and a waste of money.” Oppenheimer has faced criticism before. When several years later the National Garden Club awarded a gold medal to him for his video The Fruit & Vegetable Garden, some critics claimed the club had made a political statement. Others, like one in Portland, Ore., did not think it was particularly good food, although it did include homemade bread.A year and a half into the video Oppenheimer did a second video, with one family, showing them cooking in a more modern way. This one also won a gold medal for the video. The second segment included family members cooking with a cast of characters. With the new project and a second prize of $5,000 — $2,500 to add a few more characters who were less central to the story — Oppenheimer could have felt confident. But the second video was not as successful as the first. His critics — and it has been a few critics — believed the second video was too repetitive.Oppenheimer, 41, and his father, George, had come up with the idea for the video during an anniversary dinner of the original video, an event held in his father’s kitchen. Oppenheimer had a “grand opening” of a vegetarian restaurant called The Kitchen. After some months, the videos were made.Oppenheimer is a native of Berkeley. At the University of California, Berkeley, he majored in music and music history. He also was on the sailing team. He played saxophone in the college jazz band. “Ski boats, that is the closest thing to a band in my experience,” he said.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in music history from UC Berkeley, he went on to get an M.F.A. in film from the University of Southern California	0
At least 13 people were killed and 20 wounded when lightning struck a makeshift mosque in a remote village in northeast Bangladesh  last night.The victims were taken to hospital for treatment.The tragedy occurred near the village of Tohom, which borders India and Bangladesh.In this villageThe mosque has been set up on a small hillside at the edge of the main area of the village.It is constructed by two families whose members live in India to escape floods across the border.Local villagers said the lightning strike killed about 60 people and injured at least another 150.But they were unable to confirm those figures.A spokesman for the emergency operations department in Chittagong said: "We do not have the number of casualties. It is difficult to confirm what happened on the ground. The death toll is high due to the shock and loss of relatives."He said the victims had been admitted to hospital but did not have any detailed information about how they were injured.He added that those treated in the hospital would be discharged within hours.In India, the state government said it would help the victims affected by the tragedy.A spokesman for the state disaster management office said: "It will be difficult to assess the amount of damage at this stage."It has been a very unfortunate incident and we will be in touch with the affected families."Tohom is about 140 miles (235km) from the capital Dhaka.The incident comes amid a dispute between India and Bangladesh and a tense political state of affairs.Rioting broke out in Dhaka on Monday after Indian and Bangladeshi border guards clashed near the Assam border.The government accused the Indians of using "unprovoked force" and an Indian envoy was later detained in Bangladesh.Indian officials blamed the Bangladeshi authorities for not protecting the border.In the last four days, the two countries have been engaged in high-level talks to discuss the issue, which has been the source of tensions between the two.Bangladesh also accuses India of backing its minority Muslim population in Assam, which India calls the "Muslim-majority region".The dispute is only the latest round in a series of territorial border clashes that have already taken a major toll on bilateral ties, particularly over the disputed Arunachal Pradesh region	0
From ancient Phoenician galleys to 21st century super yachts, a lot has changed about the way people travel the high seas over the centuries. The Mirabella V, built in 2003, is the world's biggest single-masted sailing yacht, with a mast that is nearly 300 ft tall. Whether it's one intrepid "micro-yachtsman" navigating the Atlantic in a boat the size of a bathtub, or an elite racing team shattering world records in a state-of-the-art catamaran, these voyages all have one thing in common: they have altered the way mankind looks at the world. MainSail takes a look at the ships, and the revolutionaries they carried on their way. Voyage of the Beagle When: 1831 Who: Naturalist Charles Darwin Where: Galapagos Islands The boat: The HMS Beagle was a 90 ft, 10-gun former British Navy warship built in 1820. The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in "The Origin of Species." Columbus discovers the New World When: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men.

Facebook's flirtation with democracy has come to an end. If it wants to, the social network can now change its policies without user approval. A weeklong open vote on proposed policy changes, Â an announcement that the company is now on the cusp of a democracy-killer, is set for February 11.The move comes as it turns 30, after years of public pressure to change its policies to reflect more in line with its social-networking ambitions instead of being "anti-trust", which it believes to be too restrictive.The company has decided to go public, after a yearlong public outreach battle with the Wall Street Journal, in what the Journal calls "a last, desperate stand" to remain in the spotlight and avoid being classified as a "social network".The company, as well as the politicians it has lobbied against, is asking users to take part in the public vote to decide whether the company should make some of the new policies public.The open-internet debate is currently raging in Europe, where a majority of the national telecoms companies in several countries have said they intend to block data transfer over the internet, because they don't want to pay to get access to websites.The UK recently introduced the world's toughest data-protection laws, prompting outrage and the support of the likes of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation, so that web-browser and plug-in company Microsoft has stopped using Internet Explorer as its default operating system on Windows 7.But it has been very quietly doing what Facebook wants. In the past few months, Facebook has moved:* it has stopped offering free accounts to college students in exchange for being allowed to create accounts used only by their fellow students.* it has ended advertising-supported "like" buttons so that the company will have to pay publishers to have an ad for their content appear next to a user's post. The change is being welcomed and protested.* it now has an entire page of about 1,000 "community standards" at the bottom of each user page that are "voluntary" and are made to comply with the company's legal obligations, but which users can opt out of.So Facebook has moved to limit the speech of its users, or, as they so put it, "We are experimenting internally to see if we're able to take this opportunity to make our community a more welcoming and inclusive place for everyone	0
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Thursday citing an alleged claim of responsibility by al Qaeda for former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination, a DHS official told CNN. An Italian news agency says al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri began planning Bhutto's killing in October. But such a claim has not appeared on radical Islamist Web sites that regularly post such messages from al Qaeda and other militant groups. The source of the claim was apparently Italian news agency, Adnkronos International (AKI), which said that al Qaeda Afghanistan commander and spokesman Mustafa Abu Al-Yazid had telephoned the agency to make the claim. "We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat [the] mujahadeen," AKI quoted Al-Yazid as saying. According to AKI, al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri set the wheels in motion for the assassination in October. One Islamist Web site repeated the claim, but that Web site is not considered a reliable source for Islamist messages by experts in the field. The DHS official said the claim was "an unconfirmed open source claim of responsibility" and the bulletin was sent out at about 6 p.m. to state and local law enforcement agencies. The official characterized the bulletin as "information sharing." Ross Feinstein, spokesman for Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, said the U.S. intelligence community is monitoring the situation and trying to figure out who is responsible for the assassination. "We are not in a position to confirm who may be responsible," Feinstein said. Feinstein said that the intelligence community "obviously analyze(s) open source intelligence," but he would not say whether the community believes the claim has any validity. For now, he said, there is "no conclusion" as to who may be responsible. Earlier, DHS spokesman Russ Knocke said Bhutto's assassination had not prompted "any adjustments to our security posture." "Of course, we continue to closely monitor events as they unfold overseas," he said. E-mail to a friend CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.	1
Amanda Knox's ex-boyfriend and murder trial co-defendant revealed in a new book that he sometimes questioned her innocence because of her "bizarre behavior" the day a British student was found dead in their urn-shaped bathtub.A book by British author Amanda Knox that has emerged as a potential bombshell in the former couple's murder trial described a behavior pattern that Knox might have displayed after becoming upset after being involved in a fight the previous evening.Knox is on trial in Italy for the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher.According to a biography of Knox, a co-defendant in the murder, James Novell, also has a biography that has come to light, describing behaviors that Knox may have shown after a fight with another student.James Novell may be the last man to know the truth about whether Knox was innocent of the killing, the book, "A Part of Me: An Investigation of Amanda Knox" (Bloomsbury), alleges."Mr. Novell described Amanda Knox's odd behavior when they returned to his flat in Seattle after having spent the afternoon together in a local park on campus at the University of Washington. Novell said it was during that evening that she showed him her bizarre behavior, which included using foul language outside of the house and becoming increasingly aggressive and violent when he tried to leave an hour later," according to the author's biography, Amanda Knox, "co-written by John F. Smith Jr." and "edited by Amanda's former sister-in-law and her husband, Dr. Marko Stojkovic."The book says Knox and Novell met in July 2006. It says Knox was wearing a white sweater and blue jeans and Novell was wearing dark clothing.The book says Novell, who is on trial with Knox, is a student at the University of Washington. He says he was in class with Knox and one of her friends. He says Knox had asked him to bring her a cup of coffee, and that when he returned to Knox, she was telling other people that he was a rapist. He said Knox's behavior that night alarmed him, and he told one of his friend's to call 911. He then went to his house.The book says Novell told Knox he could not believe she had said he was a rapist. It says Novell	0
Twin brothers David and Jason Benham have lost their opportunity to host their own HGTV show. The brothers ran afoul of the network after the site Right Wing Watch published a post about the pair, labeling David Benham as an "anti-gay, anti-choice extremist" for reportedly leading a prayer rally in 2012 outside of the Democratic National Convention held in Charlotte, North Carolina. The site posted a recording of Benham talking to a talk show host about "homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation" and "demonic ideologies" taking hold in colleges and public schools. Benham also discusses the fight for North Carolina's Amendment One, which involved a ban on same-sex marriage and civil unions in the state constitution. The Benham brothers were the planned stars of the HGTV show "Flip It Forward," set to premiere in October, in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford. An April press release described the planned show this way: "After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford. In each episode, the guys help a deserving family find a fixer-upper and transform it into their forever home -- with a healthy dose of sibling rivalry between the brothers along the way." But after the post went public, HGTV tweeted, "HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series." Thursday night, Jason Benham told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that HGTV had vetted the pair. "When they -- a year and a half ago -- saw some of the footage where my brother was saying the things he was saying, they spoke with us. "They got to know us a little better and then they made a judgment call, recognizing that David and I have no hate in our heart for anyone. "We've been running a successful real estate company for the last 11 years and we help all people. There is no discrimination," said Jason Benham. His comments were echoed by his brother. "We love all people. I love homosexuals. I love Islam, Muslims, and my brother and I would never discriminate. Never have we -- never would we," said David Benham.	1
A Canadian tourist was killed after a small inflatable tour boat collided with a whale off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, authorities said Thursday. The victim was identified as ÂPeter A. Kranz,Â a 42-year-old man from Peterborough, Ont.ÂHis family and friends described him as a family man who loved travelling and spending time with his wife and 5-year-old son,Â said Sgt. Jerald Dolan, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard in San Diego.Police recovered KranzÂs body a short time later, and later said it appeared he had died of hypothermia during the accident. His body and the rest of the boat were found in about 150 feet of water, a Coast Guard report said.The tourist in question had been out on a three-day whale watching trip when the Coast Guard notified them about the incident. Witnesses said Kranz had told them he was on an island off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, and that the boat apparently struck a whale.The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday that conditions were good for whale-watching at that time of the year, and that whale collisions with boats happen from time to time.It was a "lone tourist'' who apparently died, but that person had a history of back problems, and may have been using an inflatable dinghy as a rescue raft. The boat was about 25 feet long.When the Coast Guard received the call about the accident, they found Kranz trapped inside the inflatable.Witnesses described a scene in which bystanders were pulled onto the boat. Some struggled to get back on. And many who tried refused, saying they didnÂt want to risk being hurt, they said.A Coast Guard official said the boat had apparently run a light.And they found the tourist, who had apparently been asleep on his makeshift inflatable raft. He was trapped inside.The official said it appeared Kranz had been wearing a lifejacket but that he may have left it on as he had put the dinghy on a rocky beach.While the Coast Guard was searching nearby, a fire rescue team arrived.The U.S. Navy is assisting in the search.

Rutgers men's assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day his boss was fired after ESPN broadcast a lengthy video of players being physically and verbally abused, the university told CNN on Thursday. Rutgers gave no reason for Martelli's resignation Wednesday. The outcry over the treatment of the players arose after ESPN on Tuesday showed footage of head coach Mike Rice shoving and berating players. ESPN reported Thursday that Martelli also was involved, in a handful of instances where he shoved players and at least one instance where he called a player "a f**king fa**ot." The network posted a different video on its website that showed Martelli getting physical with players and an interview with Eric Murdock, a former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, who said Martelli was known as "Baby Rice." Martelli, son of longtime St. Joseph's coach Phil Martelli, joined the Rutgers staff in May 2010 after three seasons as an assistant under Rice at Robert Morris, which twice made the NCAA tournament. In a statement obtained by CNN, Martelli said, "I am sickened that as an assistant coach I contributed in any way to an unacceptable culture. Wednesday I resigned from Rutgers and I hope that coaches on all levels will learn something important from these events. For my actions, I am deeply sorry and I apologize to the players from the bottom of my heart." The news comes the same day Rutgers revealed the university will pay Rice a $100,000 longevity bonus, according to a university spokesman. Rice said after he was fired that "there's no explanation for what's on those videos because there's no excuse for it," according to CNN affiliate WABC. "I can't say anything right now except I'm sorry, and there will never be a time where I'm going to use any of that as an excuse or will there be any excuse," he said, according to the station. "I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family -- who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them." The video, which ESPN said features excerpts of practice sessions shot between 2010 and 2012, initially had earned Rice a three-game suspension, a $75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes.	1
More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy. Now, a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit. Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care. Depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby. Therefore, the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women, researchers say. "There is no easy way out of this," says Dr. Tim Oberlander, a developmental pediatrician at BC Children's Hospital, in Vancouver, Canada, who has studied the effects of SSRIs on children exposed in the womb, but was not involved in the current study. "Depression needs to be managed, and for some women, the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary." Health.com: 3 Signs you should stop, adjust, or switch antidepressants The new study, led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund, of Aarhus University, in Denmark, found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU. Women have been using SSRIs during pregnancy since the early 1990s, Lund and her colleagues point out in the report, which is published in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. These drugs, which include Zoloft, Prozac, and others, are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy. It's been difficult to confirm their safety, however, especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in, like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn. Health.com: Do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix? Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but weren't taking SSRIs. Some, but not all, of these women had suffered from depression. "Using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders," the researcher notes.	1
A New York airport screener who removed two pipes from a traveler's bag and set them aside Monday morning prompted a security scare six hours later when the next shift saw the pipes and feared they iced a passenger's bags. The airline passenger was sent back to the gate in tears after getting "very loud and deep" complaints from other passengers and flight attendants.The man was one of at least three who did not have to remove the pipes after learning of the new screening procedures, which are meant to stop travelers with potentially explosive devices from boarding with loose explosives."When he got back to the gate, he realized it was different because everyone had been told to go through the pipes, but he had never seen them with any object. So he wasn't clear on whether it was still legal to board the plane," said a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss security procedures."It was the longest six hours of his life and he was very distraught to be honest," the same person said.The United States Air Force announced late Monday that two pipes were indeed discovered in a bag in a metal bin on a United Airlines flight from Miami to Newark, N.J., and that passengers were "disturbed."The person was not identified by name and the person's description of what took place was in a sealed criminal complaint against one of three airport employees who made the discovery. The report described the discovery as it took place in the bin on the plane from Miami to Newark. The report doesn't say what the pipes were, but the pipes have not been shown to be explosives."In recent days, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has learned that passengers who boarded an international flight from Miami International Airport in the past 24 hours, but did not require screening, may have been removed from the flight because the screening process required two pipes attached to an explosive device, which could have been removed and used as a weapon on the aircraft," the United States Air Force said in a statement.The statement said the FAA was investigating.It added the FAA is the U.S. federal agency charged with regulating air safety and security.At least three passengers have since been allowed on the plane with no special screening and have boarded, the person said, adding one passenger in the bin was given a refund after a flight attendant noticed what appeared to be loose explosive material in his bag."	0
An Egypt-backed cease-fire between Israel and Hamas fell apart Tuesday as rocket attacks from Gaza were again answered by Israeli airstrikes. The rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza never ceased, Israeli defense Secretary Gadi Eisenkot said. The last time that the cease-fire was ended was in November during Operation Protective Edge in which Israeli missiles killed more than 1,200 Palestinians including more than 400 children. Israel killed more than 5,000 Gazans during the operation. The U.S. and U.N. condemned the Israeli military's response. The U.N. Security Council expressed condemnation of violence, calling it "disproportionate." The U.N. Security Council strongly urged Israel to investigate and hold to account those responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in its air campaign against Gaza. The U.N. also said it had "grave concerns" about Palestinian claims in Israel's military response. Hamas, which operates an independent terrorist organization in the territory, has said it would not accept any cease-fire that did not give Gaza an equal voice in the Palestinian struggle for liberation. Its leaders have also been calling for a mass-march through the Gaza Strip to be launched today. The Israeli government said its response was necessary to halt the rocket attacks during a period of heightened tension. As of Tuesday morning, 10 rockets had been fired off in the past 24 hours, an Israeli military spokesman said.California:California Senate Republicans voted down an effort to pass a bill to protect the rights of gays and lesbians in the wake of California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state.

Poor Microsoft. People who use your search engine seem especially interested in ... Apple. Bing published its most-searched news stories for 2012, and topping the list -- ahead of the presidential election, Superstorm Sandy and the London Olympics -- was the iPhone 5, the newest version of Apple's iconic smartphone. In case we need it, the ranking is further evidence of the feverish speculation that accompanies major Apple product launches. Released in October, the iPhone 5 was the subject of countless rumors and news reports all year about its launch date, features and 4G capability. But still -- did people on Bing really care more about the iPhone 5 than the election? "Tim Cook might want to send a thank you card to Steve Ballmer this morning," wrote Taylor Soper on GeekWire. At least the presidential election beat out Honey Boo Boo. Other tech news stories on Bing's list included the launch of Amazon's newest tablet, the Kindle Fire HD, and Facebook's public stock offering in May. That's a big change from 2011, when no tech stories made Bing's most-searched list. The complete list of Bing's top news stories: 1. iPhone 5 2. 2012 elections 3. 2012 Olympics 4. Hurricane Sandy 5.

Facebook IPO Reality TV star Kim Kardashian topped Bing's most-searched person rankings for the year, dethroning 2011 champ Justin Bieber. President Obama was 46th, while his GOP rival Mitt Romney was 43rd. Apple also dominated Bing's list of the year's most-searched consumer electronics, taking 5 of the 10 spots. Other popular products were the Samsung Galaxy S III phone, the Kindle and Sony's PlayStation 3 gaming console. Facebook topped Bing's rankings of most-searched social media, followed by Twitter and, perhaps surprisingly, MySpace. Fortunately for Microsoft, the company wasn't shut out of its own search results. On the consumer-electronics list were the Xbox and Windows 8.

MotoGP championship leader Casey Stoner claimed his 10th pole position of 2011 on Saturday to boost his bid for a ninth victory this season at the Japan Grand Prix. After 14 of 18  laps without a top three finish, he did so with a lap of 1:23.819, a 1.837-second advantage over pole-sitter Takashi Kogure.Stoner's time was the third round in a row he has bested the field this season with a gap of at least three seconds. He led from the start to finish the entire race while Kogure ended up second, leaving him the winner by only half a second.Stronk Racing's Takuya Izawa rounded out the podium, leading from Kogure by 1.051 seconds.Stoner dominated the battle at the start with a rapid lap of 1:23.963, while Kogure made his first appearance on the front at the start of lap two. The two continued to closely follow each other across the first half of the track with Stoner emerging with a margin of almost half a second.As the order of the podium began to settle, Stoner's lead began to lessen. He began to pull wide, though, as he moved into third on lap six for his first time in five laps, though not without an attempt at making up the deficit. Kogure's quick pit stop on lap nine helped give him a good run to the front of the field, though. On lap 11, he tried to get past Stoner, but the Japanese rookie pulled right off the track on the final corner, and Kogure took control of the lead. This run led into an attempt by Kogure to take sixth place, but he was forced wide by Stoner for the second straight lap.Stoner was able to claw back significant ground on the following laps, but on lap 20, he made a mistake into the braking point as he tried to set the lap record. As the field slowed as he approached, he slowed down enough for Kogure to close within two tenths of a second. Kogure then made a move on Denny Hamlin, who was able to leap over his car to make the pass and claimed fifth place, but was hit with a five second penalty for the move.Stronk Racing's Takuya Izawa began to edge	0
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week. Marriage is an institution intended for two people who love one another, who want to commit to lifetime bonding as mates, and to form a family, whether it's only the two of them, or also includes children. The traditional concept of marriage has evolved over time. In recent history, it has been defined by most religions, and the states, as one man and a woman. Yet there are millions of humans whose makeup is such that they are attracted to the same gender and share the universal human desire to bond with a lifetime mate. They're gays. In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians. Gay couples and their families have lived openly in our communities for more than 30 years, and we know them now as neighbors, family members and friends. In the course of living their daily lives, raising families and contributing to society, we've come to see that gay and lesbian Americans share the same hopes and dreams as everyone else. Yet for decades, we've had a political debate about opposite-gender vs. same-gender marriages that has created a constant undercurrent of unrest. What many public figures have known to be true about gay people in their personal lives has been -- until recently -- unacceptable to acknowledge openly in the political realm. Over the last several years, however, public opinion has pushed our political conversation forward dramatically. Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable. The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families. Congress passed a law -- the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA -- that forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, although this is a matter, constitutionally, that most agree belongs to the states to decide. And that is the wrong that the Supreme Court set right this week. The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional -- and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.	1
It had all the elements of an irresistible story, but ultimately it was too good to be true. A popular celebrity. Breathless media chronicling his every move. And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new  development.The truth was that Michael Jackson was as much of an outsider as he let on. The media had made him out to be a black-hatted, purple-haired, red-faced freak who would give an arm to anyone and anything that wanted a hug.It wasn’t entirely untrue, and the media’s image was as much a construct as his true personality. But the media also portrayed him as a person who wasn’t always likable—in a good way. And he had the ear of those in high places in the power structure of Atlanta.They may have been a little rough on him, but they were, at the end of the day, only interested in protecting their reputation.Michael Jackson was a very private person, but his very existence was something that could not be publicly known.For that reason, there was no way he could have known—or even sensed—that Atlanta was actually being threatened.He lived with only two people in the most secluded neighborhood in Atlanta. She was the only adult in his life, and he loved her deeply.But if the media or the people in power in the neighborhood saw his personal life as being a threat to their safety, then they would have acted to protect him.So how is it possible that these two people were able to keep Michael’s story from being the same at the same time?It may surprise many people to learn that neither of them was the mastermind in Michael Jackson’s plan who set him on his path to music in the first place. Both of them took the risk in a completely different direction when it became apparent that his celebrity status could not be sustained.But that is the whole point of the story. The more we know about him, the more we can become fascinated with him. And that fascination with him can be more than just mere curiosity.In a world of fame and wealth, we learn to become fascinated with people in a way that can be life changing.You never have to be afraid that you might accidentally meet someone you might become infatuated with.You never have to	0
It was a rare sight for media watchers on Wednesday: Rupert Murdoch, the indomitable head of the News Corp. empire, called before a judicial inquiry to explain how his influence has shaped Britain's media and political landscape. Still, it's not the first time the 81-year-old chairman of News Corp. has been grilled in the United Kingdom. He also appeared before lawmakers last summer to answer questions on alleged phone hacking at the News of the World. But the focus in the Leveson Inquiry hearing was on Murdoch's dealings with a succession of British prime ministers going back decades and whether these cozy relationships worked to his personal advantage. The awkward questions come as News Corp. also faces investigation in the United States over alleged phone hacking and increased scrutiny in Australia following an inquiry into media standards. On the stand in London, Murdoch insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had "never asked a prime minister for anything." "You would wish to point out that no express favors were offered to you by Mrs. Thatcher; is that right?" he was asked by Leveson Inquiry lawyer Robert Jay, referring to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "And none asked," responded Murdoch. Murdoch denies political influence The question of influence is key because of the concerns raised over the impartiality of Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt in considering a takeover bid by News Corp. for British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Hunt's aide resigned Wednesday over communications with News Corp. that suggested the global media giant was getting inside information, although Hunt denied any improper dealings on his own part. 'This is a man who has held power ...' And it's significant in part because of the sheer scale of News Corp.'s operations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. With some 48,000 employees worldwide, the company "had total assets of approximately U.S. $60 billion, total annual revenues of approximately U.S. $34 billion and in excess of 260,000 shareholders" as of the end of last year, Murdoch said in written testimony. "This is a man who has held power far greater and far longer than anyone else in our time," said Michael Wolff, a media commentator, founder of Newser.com and author of "The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch."	1

Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Hundreds of people, many of them young, turned out in Athens Monday to take an anti-austerity protest march through the city center, which saw the gathering of hundreds of protesters outside parliament, some screaming slogans at lawmakers. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦The U.S. Treasury Department has warned Greek debt holders not to sell bonds and cut holdings in exchange for aid because of its concern over a Greek default and the country's debt problems. In a Monday statement, the Treasury said Greek bonds and other debt issued or guaranteed by non-Greeks were being scrutinized. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Three prominent U.S. senators -- Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- have introduced a bill that would require the federal government to use more than 50 percent of any international bailout money it provides Greece to be used to reduce pensions for public-sector workers. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦The Greek government Monday said it is willing to sell more of its debt, possibly raising the level to 80 percent. The news followed talks between Greece and its international creditors Monday, when the government said Athens will consider raising the debt to 80 percent but is seeking assurances that a restructuring of the debt would not lead to higher interest rates on Greek debt.

Try to imagine the situation," says Dezso Gyarmati, captain of Hungary's 1956 Olympic water polo team. "A superpower destroys your country with weapons and tanks -- a country that has never asked for that power to be there. And after that revolution is crushed you have to face the representatives of that superpower." The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 became the backdrop to one of the most famous contests in Olympic history, where blood spilled in the sporting arena came to symbolize the bloody struggle of a nation against a brutal oppressor, the former Soviet Union. The events at the Melbourne Games in December that year became known as the "Blood in the Water" match, but when Hungary's water polo team set off for Australia in early November, the possibility of freedom still hung over the streets of Budapest. Mass protests and fighting which erupted on October 23 had died down after a ceasefire was ordered, and Soviet armed forces were beginning their withdrawal. Gyarmati had taken part in the initial rally, leaving the team's training camp in the hills above Budapest to join protestors on the streets. But by the time they set foot on Australian soil, Gyarmati and his teammates were informed of a brutal turn of events as Soviet forces ruthlessly reasserted their grip on the Hungarian capital. More than 2,000 protesters were killed in the fighting, hundreds more were injured and many thousands were forced to flee the country. It proved to be a bloody prelude to a bruising semifinal showdown with the Soviet water polo team. Gyarmati recalls a tough, but generally disciplined match which turned sour in the closing moments when Soviet player Valentin Prokopov elbowed Hungary's star Ervin Zador in the face, cutting him below the eye. "I told (Zador) to get out of the pool," Gyarmati recalled, "but not where he was, but to swim across the pool to the grandstand with 8,000 people. "By the time he'd swum over, the blood had trickled down onto his chest. He looked like he (had come out) from the butcher. The audience exploded." The headline "Cold War violence erupts at Melbourne Olympics" ran the following day in the Sydney Morning Herald, which reported that many spectators left their seats in the stands, shouting abuse and spitting at the Russians.	1
While Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed more evidence of his importance to Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday, Barcelona responded with an ominous warning of the club's powers even without Lionel Messi. With the four-time world player illsman absent due to a hip injury, Neymar will be expected to form a similar centre of gravity with the Swede, and that should see Barcelona dominate in their pursuit of a third consecutive Champions League title. Their success will likely determine the Premier League's future direction, and with Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool all set to struggle at the very least to retain their top four spots, the current champions are well positioned to maintain that status. At the very least, the title race will be a fight to the finish, and the return of the Brazil star will serve as a fresh impetus for the domestic season.Neymar is a fascinating individual with a fascinating background, and by all accounts has been an excellent player since his early days at Barcelona’s Juvenil A side. However, it’s worth noting that his decision to join Barcelona in 2007 was somewhat of a surprise. Aged 17, he had been looking for a fresh start in a new country, after not being able to secure opportunities at Brazilian club Cruzeiro, and instead being loaned out by the club to play in Italy. While the move has since become one of the most talked-about stories of the 2007/08 season, it wasn’t the move itself that has sparked so much interest. It was simply the timing of it, as he was given his chance to shine after being passed over by PSG, and even had to wait until after they had beaten Manchester City to get the chance to start. In truth, that wasn’t the only reason he signed."It's not how you play in a match or how you are as a footballer that matters." – Neymar in 2015His decision to join Barcelona was largely influenced by his father. Brazilian striker Ronaldo, widely considered to be one of the best strikers the planet has ever produced, had made himself available to his daughter for a transfer to Barcelona. He was then asked to join by the La Masia academy in the second tier of Brazilian football at age 17 in order to have a stronger chance of making the team, and so signed his first professional contract with the club.The young defender, who had originally been considered for the Brazil national team,	0
Syrian commanders say their troops along the border with Iraq are making strides in nabbing militants intent on staging suicide attacks in Baghdad. Syrian soldiers in a pickup truck patrol the area of their country's border with Iraq. But, the commanders say, they could do a better job if they were able to obtain modern equipment denied to them because of sanctions and if they received cooperation from the U.S. military. The commanders also say U.S. aircraft occasionally violate Syria's airspace, a situation that points to the lack of coordination between the countries. "We work within our abilities," said Gen. Khaklil Al-Khaled, a provincial military commander in northeastern Syria. "The border constitutes a daily obsession to us, to prevent infiltration and confront the contraband groups and jihadist groups that infiltrate the border."  Watch what life is like on the Syrian border » Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border, where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship. The Syrian government "began limited cooperation with the United States in the global war against terrorism" after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. State Department has said. The United States has long criticized Syria for being a staging ground for insurgents who infiltrate Iraq in the Euphrates River valley of Anbar province and conduct attacks in the towns along that waterway and in Baghdad. It has also criticized Syria for its ties to Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and the Palestinian movement Hamas. Syria says it is doing what it can to thwart insurgent activity and the United States in turn has softened its negative rhetoric toward President Bashar Al-Assad's regime. They say they've arrested many foreign fighters and have confiscated many weapons. The number of monthly insurgent strikes in Iraq has dropped dramatically recently as Iraqis who once backed insurgents in Anbar province have turned against them. Still, some insurgent activity continues in Anbar and along the Nineveh province section of the Iraqi-Syrian border. Al-Khaled said Syrian troop outposts are strung along the vast, sandy 385-mile Syria-Iraq border, with 12 soldiers per post. The troops have erected a sand wall and embark on daily foot and vehicle patrols.	1
The Washington Navy Yard is the home to high-level naval personnel and is the workplace for at least 3,000 service members and civilian employees. Located in the heart of Washington, D.C., the premises include a park and many  of land. It is also the location where President Clinton delivered his inaugural address on January 20, 1993, the same day as the September 11 attacks.Navy Yard is home to the United States' most highly decorated warship, the USS Enterprise, and is one of the few naval bases which is continuously maintained and active. Navy Yard is designated as a National Historic Landmark District and an Urban Landmark: The Washington Navy Yard Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1972. The Navy Yard was also added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1980.The Washington Navy Yard was built on a  tract of land that once covered  between D Street in the northeast and the Potomac River in the south. This area was originally occupied by a mill complex known as the "Blue Plains Complex". As the site developed, additional land was acquired to the east and west of the old complex. The complex was subsequently renamed "Naval Base No. 1" and eventually completed as the Washington Navy Yard in 1884. Later the property was expanded to accommodate a number of facilities and the Navy Yard is now home to three separate installations, the Ship and Submarine Base, the Nuclear Propulsion Plant, and the Aviation Repair Facility. The Yard is also home to an active U.S. Air Force base and an active U.S. Army base, which was originally developed for the purpose of repairing Army cargo ships. Both the Air Force and the Army remain in place today, and both bases are designated as National Historic Landmarks.By 1910, the land area within the Washington Navy Yard had been organized into the area currently occupied by the Navy Yard and its three major establishments. The Navy Yard was expanded and several buildings were constructed, including the Naval Depot Building, the Navy's largest single structure in the world, which also holds the title of largest brick building in the world, currently standing at , and still is by a margin. The base also contains the world's largest man-made lake, and an extensive amount of other unique features.The first Naval Base to develop outside of the United States was located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1894 as the naval	0
A leading international children's charity has warned that Elton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned. Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on  January 6, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Yuri KadobnovThe charity has been approached by families desperate to save children after the Elton John fan and singer's visit to St. Petersburg, Russia.The charity, Hope for the Future, raised £50,000 in a crowdfunding campaign to fly a baby of its own back to the UK.The charity had originally wanted to raise £1m, but was able to raise more than £400,000 through the campaign.It has now raised £75,000 for its own rescue operation to fly three babies back to the UK.One of the three children the charity plans to rescue is a baby boy in the orphanage in Ukraine, who is now aged 14 months. The charity's director, Simon Cozens, said the orphanage in Ukraine was unable to care for the child, but said that could change in about a year time."If we were to rescue this child here, his chances of survival are slim. But if we can raise enough money on the ground for him to be sent back to the UK, we would have a great chance of saving his life."Mr Cozens was speaking following his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine."It's an amazing place. I just want to thank the people of Ukraine, and the government there, for taking the risk that they did. They are making a huge difference to the orphans there and saving lives," he said.Elton John recently visited an orphanage in Ukraine where a baby boy was adopted that would not have survived in the womb.It's the latest controversial campaign by a celebrity to adopt a baby after Elton John posted a photo of the child and wrote: "I'm very proud to announce that my 14-month old baby is now healthy and happy at Hope for the Future - we're all very happy to now have our little boy home."On July 14, 2016, former One Direction boyband member Niall Horan posted an Instagram picture in which he was holding an orphaned baby boy he had rescued.Following this, Elton John himself went to the orphanage and said	0
Political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $70 million on health-themed TV ads since January 2011, according to a CNN analysis of ad spending data. What the health care ruling means to you The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule Thursday on the constitutionality of President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. According to the data, which is tracked by Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, one of the groups that spent the most is AARP, which funneled about $10.3 million into ads in favor of the law. Ariel Gonzalez, director of health and family advocacy at AARP, says the group remains supportive of the legislation -- which was signed into law in March 2010 -- because it is hugely beneficial to his organization's members. Timeline of the health care law "We lobbied for its passage and we continue to comment on the regulations and implementation," Gonzalez said. "The law does outstanding things for seniors and for our younger members. We are excited about the closure of the Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap with medications. We are excited about free preventive services and wellness benefits and the provision that eliminates the pre-existing conditions barrier and high premiums, and it has ended a good deal of fraud that had happened within the system." But AARP's pro-reform ads were largely an exception, the data shows. Most groups' health care ads were soundly opposed to the law. Karl Rove's conservative Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies spent the most among all groups and campaigns -- $14.98 million -- on ads that ran 22,004 times. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce bought the second highest number of spots, spending more than $8.3 million to run ads against the legislation more than 13,000 times. The 60 Plus Association, which characterizes itself as the conservative alternative to AARP, spent $1.6 million on 2,861 spots. Jonathan Collegio, spokesman for Crossroads GPS, said their ads are designed told hold candidates who supported the law "accountable for their vote." "Our goal with the ads is to create an environment where repealing the legislation or replacing it with more free-market principals is possible," he said. Basics: Health care reform issues	1
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi flew to Greece Sunday to deliver a personal message from Libyan leader Â© Sipa USA/ReutersAn Iranian-trained revolutionary who was a senior official in the Libyan government and minister in charge of the countryâ€™s oil exports has been extradited by Italy to Libya, the Guardian reported Wednesday.Abdulmohsen Fattah el-Sanussi also worked as interim prime minister Muammar Gaddafiâ€™s senior energy adviser. While Fattah was in Italy, the Gaddafisâ€™ son and son-in-law seized control of the capital Tripoli and the entire eastern part of the country.According to Libyaâ€™s National Transitional Council, Libya has been under a state of emergency since February 28 when Fattah, the head of the oil and gas sector in the National Oil Corporation, took control of that section of government, according to the NTCâ€™s official news agency. The emergency was later extended until the end of the month.The Guardian reported that Fattahâ€™s extradition has been made possible once the Italian courts decided the charges against him were not valid in Libya. On Monday, Libyaâ€™s Supreme Court ruled that the Libyan government would be unable to pursue charges against Fattah, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.The Italian prime ministerâ€™s office said the decision that Fattah is innocent is a clear signal from the Italian judiciary of Libyaâ€™s willingness to cooperate with the international community.Libyan National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil said the Gaddafis are the countryâ€™s only remaining national leaders who can offer the country an exit from its current state of economic and political crisis.â€œWe believe in the people and we will stand with them to the end,â€ said Jalil, according to the news agency AFP. â€œI have the feeling that if we didnâ€™t send them a message now it would be too late.â€â€œThis will be a positive test for what is happening for the international community,â€ Jumah said.â€œWe have to accept one condition from the international community: they will not be	0
A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants on Wednesday, intelligence officials told CNN. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the suspected drone fired two missiles on a militant hideout in South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Wednesday's strike is the first since March 17, when a drone strike in North Waziristan killed 44 people -- most of them civilians, two Pakistani sources said. Such strikes have inflamed tensions between Pakistan and the United States. Pakistan has formally asked the United States for an apology for the March 17 strike. The United States does not officially acknowledge the Central Intelligence Agency's secret drone program that targets al Qaeda militants, but it is the only country operating in the region with the capability to carry out such strikes. A senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN drone strikes carried out by Americans -- once widely believed to have the tacit approval and cooperation of Pakistani intelligence -- are now carried out autonomously by the CIA. "It's unilateral action," he said. The official expressed dismay after Wednesday's strike. "What is this? A message (from the Americans) that it's business as usual, irrespective of what we ask of you? If it is, it's a crude way of getting your message across," he said. The official added that Pakistan had asked the United States to curtail its drone strikes in remote tribal areas. "We are not necessarily saying stop. What we are saying is irrespective of tactical games, this is not useful in the long run," he said. "We need a relook and to not be too trigger happy and be selective." The drone strike came just two days after Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country. In addition to the aerial attacks, the Pakistanis are angered by what they say is the lack of transparency about the number of CIA operatives and the extent of American intelligence activities within their country. Although the U.S.-Pakistani relationship has been on rocky ground for some time, It came to a head when CIA contractor	1
Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential "American Bandstand," has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said. He was 82. Clark suffered a heart attack while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an outpatient procedure, his publicist said Wednesday. "Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful." The family has not yet decided whether there will be a public memorial service for the multifaceted Clark, although Shefrin said, "There will be no funeral." Clark suffered what was then described as "a mild stroke" in December 2004, just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve" specials. He returned as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005. Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday. "But then he would get deluged by people who were stroke victims and other people who had infirmities and they were such admirers of his fighting spirit," said Dreier, R-California. Share your memories of Dick Clark Clark's "American Bandstand" work, which he began when it was a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956, earned him the nickname "America's oldest living teenager." The dance show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later. "If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet," singer Aretha Franklin told "AC360." The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American and other performers to millions of young TV viewers. His audiences were integrated, among the first on television. "Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark," said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961. Entertainers told CNN on Wednesday that Clark knew that music transcends race. "Dick understood the connection that music had. It wasn't about black, it wasn't about white," Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men told "Piers Morgan Tonight." Seacrest gave a statement to CNN expressing deep sadness for "the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark."	1
An Italian humanitarian activist and journalist who was kidnapped in Gaza has been found dead and one person is in custody, the Hamas Interior Ministry said Friday in a statement. Police investigating the case learned where 36-year-old Ângelo Lopes' body had been found in a house in Beit Hanoun Saturday morning, it said. Hamas has not said why he was kidnapped. Lopes was abducted March 29 and he initially been held in Gaza, but was later arrested. Lopes was released in August after three weeks in custody. In early January, he wrote an open letter to supporters, arguing that Hamas has become like a "terrorist gang" and threatening him with arrest because of his work.For Palestinian journalists, the threat of arrest and imprisonment are the most common threats."For anyone who works for Palestinian media like me, there comes a time when you wake up and realize that you are no longer working in your home country," said Khaleel Al-Khatib, a Palestinian reporter for Al Jazeera English based in Gaza City. "It's an extremely painful process, and you go to work every day, and you come home and you sit in the office and think, 'Am I still the same person that I was just a moment ago?' And you think, 'Am I still the person that I was last week?'"There have been nearly 300 cases of journalists reported missing or arrested in Gaza since Hamas took over in 2007, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the vast majority of cases occurred between the years of 2012 and 2014.The death of Lopes has not yet been confirmed, which might have created confusion in Gaza where a large number of young men do not carry identification. While media workers tend to be identified by their first names, the Gaza Strip is divided into regions. The case of Lopes' death could have been the case of one of those regions.The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, an advocacy group, has been in touch with Lopes' family and has also appealed to the media in the West Bank to help identify his whereabouts."Any information regarding the condition of journalist Ângelo Lopes is very important. We appeal to the media to give this information to the family," syndicate president Nasser Shabani said in a statement. "Journalists are the face of the revolution and we won't let them be disappeared. We	0
There was a pretty epic party on Wednesday night. You probably weren't there. But don't take it personally. We can't all be awesome. Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties. That, and defile the mashed potatoes. Granted, this particular epic party was held on Twitter. And it was hosted by CVS. And, technically, everybody was invited. Thus, I'm suddenly now beginning to question my awesomeness. Me: "Am I awesome?" Me: "Not really." Me: "I appreciate your honesty." Me: "Whatever, nerd." OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media. And for a good hour or so during the big digital soiree, the hashtag was a leading trend. Hurrah! Victory for the marketing department! Treat yourself to some hooker makeup. (Seriously. That section exists, right?) Not surprisingly, however, a random dude eventually entered the conversation and was instantly confused.	1
More than 40 years after pingpong diplomacy led to a thaw in Sino-American relations, it was on display again -- in rudimentary form -- as Michelle Obama visited a Beijing high school during her family's first full day of a vernal equinox-themed spring break in 2015.But on this visit, the first to China since the end of the Cold War, the former first lady was the only Westerner at the school's annual carnival parade in the capital's ancient Garden of 16 Ceremonial Peaks, which drew 1.5 million people last year.The parade is a showcase for Chinese traditional culture, which was first brought to the West by the Ming and Qing dynasties.The parade's director, Xu Ying, said that he knew that the visit would be controversial, as the former first lady was an outspoken critic of the U.S."There are a number of things that we don't do in the United States that we do in China. In the United States, we only speak to each other by phone," Xu told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the parade. "But in China, we meet face-to-face, we exchange gifts and talk about our families."Xu said he was worried that the parade's organizers would not be able to "perform their roles and make a good impression," as they had in the past."They are the people who have been working in this business for a long time," he said.In a nod to the visit, Wang Yibo, director of the High Schools of Beijing Municipal Administration Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations and Cultural Exchange, said this year's parade was expected to be bigger than last year's."We are not afraid and feel very excited," Wang said.Michelle Obama and her daughters will also have a role in promoting Chinese culture.The Obamas have taken a series of trips to China since the 2008 presidential election, including a trip this past spring to promote women in finance.The former first lady, along with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, signed a $1.18 billion deal in June to jointly help fund a science and technology institute in Beijing.The former first lady previously visited Beijing in 2013, taking home a traditional Chinese painting, a hand puppet and many other gifts. She also joined thousands of schoolchildren celebrating the Beijing 2008	0
The misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. An employee at the center has tested positive for the bacterium, which is kept at the facility. The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, said the bacteria probably aren't a threat to the general population. Inspectors from the CDC and the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the misuse of outer garments "could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice," a news release said. "Additionally, CDC and APHIS inspectors determined that Tulane primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing, which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves." The bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, was being tested on mice in a biosafety level 3 lab at the Covington, Louisiana campus. It can cause can cause melioidosis, also known as Whitmore's disease. All research with the agent at the facility was suspended on February 11 and will remain suspended until it can be shown that there are no more risks and that proper procedures are being followed, the CDC said. The CDC says the primate facility can resume that research when Tulane officials show inspectors that: • Entity-wide procedures exist to ensure animals accidentally exposed in the future are managed appropriately; • All personal protective equipment procedures are thoroughly reviewed and revised appropriately to lessen the risk of future breaches; • All Tulane primate center personnel are trained on any new or revised protective clothing procedures; and • Improved entry and exit procedures to the outside enclosures housing non-human primates are in place to stop any further transmission among the animals." The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture say they have completed their investigation, which began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others had antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. According to the CDC, "the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source." It is not transmitted between humans or animals, "and the risk of acquiring melioidosis is low," the CDC said.	1
Katy Perry is the "most rewarded digital act" ever, according to the organization that hands out gold and platinum records. Perry fans have bought 72 million singles online, which is 20 million more digital singles than the No. 2 artist, Rihanna, has sold, the Recording Industry Association of America announced. Taylor Swift is third with 51 million digital singles sold. How iTunes changed music, and the world The music industry group, which started honoring vinyl record sales in 1958, launched its digital sales awards in 2004 when online music downloads -- not including the pirated versions -- became a mainstream way of buying songs. The RIAA added online music streaming to its tracking last year. Katy Perry is the most followed on Twitter Perry has earned 18 gold, 16 platinum and 56 multiplatinum digital singles awards in addition to her multiplatinum awards for her album "Teenage Dream" and a platinum award for the album "One of the Boys." Perry's top hits include "I Kissed a Girl," "Hot N Cold," "Dark Horse" and "Birthday." RIAA Chairman Cary Sherman, at a ceremony Wednesday, called Perry "a force to be reckoned with in music." "She embodies all that makes a true global superstar: the musical talent, the extraordinary drive and genuine charisma, and an intrinsic connection with her fans," Sherman said. "The award is a reflection of her deep commitment to those qualities and to her music, which has propelled her to this historic milestone." Katy Perry disses Miley's tongue, Miley bites back	1
Manchester City crushed Aston Villa 4-0 with Mario Balotelli scoring a hat-trick to go temporarily top of the English Premier League ahead of city rivals Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Birmingham later Tuesday. Although City ills, United will feel that they have done likewise.The Red Devils (2), Swansea City (1), Arsenal (1) and Tottenham (1) remain a point behind City and just two points away from United's goal.The Red Devils were the closest team to City's goal but the first half of the game was a cagey affair. Manchester City was always going to be the side to pull away from the other teams due to their attacking prowess, however, from the opening second of the Premier League, the Red Devils showed they were a different team. Villa were never able to close the gap on the Red Devils, and they showed why with their second goal in the second half. The Villans looked very lively at times in the second, but apart from the first goal, it wasn't easy. But City were soon through a number of key chances and scored again in the 53rd minute. Manchester City defender and English international Steven Pienaar received the ball in the box and hit a shot into the top corner of the net. In the 90th minute, the Red Devils finally broke through, through Mario Balotelli. Balotelli showed that he is in an excellent condition by scoring his third goal of the season. In the 90th minute, Balotelli took a free kick and made a perfect run from the edge of the Villa box to fire a shot across the goalkeeper and in. Now to the final score: 1-1.Manchester City was awarded a point for their goal before the game started. That wasn't a shock to anyone. Not only did the man of the hour play the role well, he helped City to make their way past their opponents and move into second place in the Premier League.Mourinho: "I am very pleased with this result. I am very pleased with the team we have today. What would people think if we score two goals against an average opponent like Aston Villa? Our concentration, our desire and spirit are the same that they were against Chelsea. I would like to congratulate them. For the first time, we were very ambitious and were able to come from behind. We have been scoring goals all season long and tonight it was in the	0
Sen. Mitch McConnell trounced his tea party-backed opponent in Kentucky's Republican primary, leading a quartet of establishment GOP candidates to victories around the country Tuesday. After an expensive and bitter campaign, the Senate minority leader led defeated challenger Matt Bevin 60%-36%, with 97% of precincts reporting, according to numbers compiled by The Associated Press. In addition to Kentucky, more moderate candidates won in Republican Senate primaries in Georgia and Oregon and in a House showdown in Idaho. And the results in Kentucky, Georgia and Oregon could improve the GOP's chances of taking back control of the Senate come November's midterm elections. Democrats hold a 55-45 voting majority in the Senate. They're defending 21 of the 36 seats in play, half of them in Republican-leaning states or states where the two parties have similar levels of support. The only states where the Democrats hope to play offense are Kentucky and Georgia. If the GOP flips six Democratic held seats, they will win control of the Senate and McConnell will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader. "We can take the reins of power away from Harry Reid and make this President accountable," McConnell said in his victory speech. "Make me the majority leader, and Kentucky will lead America." How McConnell crushed the tea party Here are rundowns in the other state races: Georgia: Republican businessman David Perdue will face Rep. Jack Kingston in a runoff in July. Perdue got 30% of the vote; Kingston received 27%, according to numbers complied by The Associated Press. Perdue and Kingston beat out a trio of more conservative candidates in the GOP primary. Among Democrats, Michelle Nunn easily won in her bid to follow in the footsteps of her father, longtime Sen. Sam Nunn. Oregon: Sen. Jeff Merkley easily won the Democratic primary, and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is the projected winner of the GOP Senate primary, topping a more conservative rival. Idaho: Rep. Mike Simpson won the GOP primary in the state's 2nd Congressional District, defeating tea party candidate Bryan Smith. 5 key primaries to watch Tuesday Ugly and expensive race Bevin, a businessman from Louisville, announced last summer he would challenge McConnell. He quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential Washington-based anti-establishment groups. The race between the two men quickly turned ugly, and expensive, as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks.	1
Dozens of flights were canceled in and out of a northeastern Japanese city on Tuesday after construction workers came across an icky, smelly cloud of smoke.The Tokyo 2020 Games have been under a month off at the moment, but organizers released a video Monday that showed the construction site of the main stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies in a Tokyo suburb. Construction workers on the site were seen wearing “Tokyo 2020” stickers on their backs before the video upload was taken.The International Olympics Committee announced Sunday that construction had been halted on the $5.6 billion-plus Yoyogi National Stadium, a massive sports arena that will be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies. The Yoyogi National Stadium, or Tokyo Dome as it is known in Japan, is the centerpiece of Tokyo 2020’s sports village and will be the focus of the opening and closing ceremonies.The work stoppage was called a day after construction workers found a toxic-smelling cloud in Tokyo Bay. On Monday, two women collapsed in the city’s Shibuya district when they inhaled the pollution. On Tuesday, the head of the Tokyo metropolitan government said the cloud was of suspicious origin.A man was taken to the hospital by ambulance after he fell in the water at Tokyo’s Yoyogi water park. The man said he did not want to go into the ocean because he had a headache. But the park’s management said the man had been vomiting blood and was in a “critical condition.”Earlier, the Japanese broadcaster NHK also reported that officials said the smoke was from a contractor digging into the side of the project site."We are deeply worried about it," Jiro Onoyama, a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee, told reporters Monday.Tokyo 2020 spokeswoman Rieko Hariwa said the organization was cooperating with Tokyo’s fire and environmental agency and a state-run contractor in the case.On a day when the athletes descended in groups after spending the afternoon and early evening at the track and field events in Tokyo, the Japanese capital was also seeing some unusual weather.Tokyo received 3.25 inches of rain in the 24 hours to 5am on Tuesday, nearly double the total of the previous 24 hours.While no rain fell in Japan, it sent residents of Osaka into a panic Tuesday morning when	0

Manager Ozzie Guillen was back in the dugout Tuesday night after serving a five-game suspension imposed by the Miami Marlins for his comments praising former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and angering the city's sizable Cuban-American population. "It's been a tough couple of days, you know what I mean?" Guillen, in his first season as Marlins manager, told reporters before a game against the Chicago Cubs. "I feel proud of the players and the coaching staff because they play well -- we wish they'd won a couple more games, but they ... went after their job very good, the way I thought they were gonna go about their business, and there's no one more excited than me to be back with them." In an interview with Time magazine earlier this month, Guillen said, "I love Fidel Castro," adding, "You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last 60 years, but that (expletive) is still there." After those comments, demonstrators rallied outside the Marlins' new $634 million stadium to denounce Guillen. The stadium is in the Little Havana section of the city, home to many who fled Cuba after Castro's 1959 communist revolution. Guillen incurs wrath of Cuban-Americans Guillen apologized during a news conference April 10 -- first speaking in Spanish -- saying that he had "betrayed a Latin community" and that he was speaking ask for forgiveness with my heart in my hand." Guillen's remarks came as his Marlins, who had often suffered from weak attendance despite winning two World Series, were seeking to burnish their brand. The club had moved into a new park in the heart of the city, changed its name (formerly the Florida Marlins), redesigned its uniforms and invested in some key offseason acquisitions. Among those moves was the hiring of Guillen, who in his previous managerial position with the Chicago White Sox had developed a reputation for building winning teams and, from time to time, making headlines with blunt remarks. In 2006, he apologized for making an anti-gay slur against a Chicago newspaper columnist, and in 2010 he said it was unfair that Japanese ballplayers got translators when Spanish-speaking players didn't. The Castro comment controversy appeared to have settled down Tuesday night as Guillen took his spot in the dugout for the game with the Cubs.	1
Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)When Ryan Sallans, an activist in the Nebraska transgender community, first went to the doctor in 2005 to talk about what he medically needed to do for his gender transition, his doctor wanted to offer medical help. That was the good news. The disconcerting news was the doctor had to Google the issue first to figure out the best medical advice. "My provider just did a Web search to figure out what dose of hormones I should be on, and put me on the highest dose," Sallans said.  That could have been a dangerous choice. "Starting too high of a dose too quickly can cause a lot of health problems, particularly to cardiovascular health." Fortunately, Sallans didn't have any health complications. But his experience left him with a mission. He volunteers to speak with medical institutions, as well as with businesses and colleges, to urge them to be more LGBT inclusive. While a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training, if they get any at all. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand For members of the LGBT community who live in more rural and conservative areas like Nebraska, the struggle to get good, or at least up-to-date, medical care may be even more difficult. In general, legal protections and institutional supports for LGBT Nebraskans are already thin, spotty or nonexistent. On March 2, the United States District Court struck down Nebraska's ban on marriage for same-sex couples, but that ruling is on appeal. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban Without the legal institution of marriage, LGBT Nebraskans typically lack family health benefits, unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners. A 2014 study from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles found that states without LGBT legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for LGBT residents than states with protections. That plays out in Nebraska. A 2014 study from researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha found that LGBT residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas.

Police have arrested four students from Wesleyan University in connection with a drug overdose over the weekend. They are to appear in court next week. Ten students and two visitors were hospitalized Sunday from complications arising from the use of the drug Molly or from alcohol. The Middletown, Connecticut, Police Department reported that 11 were hospitalized because of Molly and one because of alcohol. The arrested students were Andrew Olson, 20; Rama Agha Al Kakib, 20; Eric Lonergan, 21, and Zachary Kramer, 21, police said in a statement. They face charges ranging from possession of a controlled substance and possession of a hallucinogen to possession of drug paraphernalia. Lonergan faces 16 counts of illegally obtaining or supplying drugs. Wesleyan University has suspended the students. University President Michael S. Roth has described Molly as a refined form of MDMA with "extremely dangerous" effects. MDMA is the active ingredient in the drug ecstasy. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most often Molly is not MDMA, but a toxic mixture of lab-created chemicals. And Middletown police said on Tuesday that they expect multiple designer drugs were in the Molly. They have executed four search warrants to find out more about where the drugs came from. Most of the chemicals are meant to stimulate the central nervous system to cause euphoric highs. They can also cause a rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, blood vessel constriction and sweating, and can prevent the body from regulating temperature. Some of the chemicals have been reported to cause intense, prolonged panic attacks, psychosis and seizures. 9 things everyone should know about the drug Molly Roth told all students to stay away from all drugs. "One mistake can change your life forever," he said. CNN's Jean Casarez, Drew Griffin, Nelli Black and Patricia DiCarlo contributed to this report.	1
A federal prosecutor formally declared Army biological researcher Bruce Ivins the sole person responsible for creating and mailing the bacterial spores that killed five people in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Officials said biodefense researcher Bruce E. Ivins, seen here in 2003, committed suicide. "We believe, based on the evidence we collected, that we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt," Jeffrey Taylor, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Taylor presented an overview of the case against Ivins, 62, after the Justice Department released documents detailing the scientist's role in what Taylor called "the worst act of bioterrorism in U.S. history." The anthrax-laced letters sickened 15 and killed two Washington postal workers, a New York hospital worker, a National Enquirer photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. In a statement issued after the news conference, Ivins' lawyers continued to proclaim their client's innocence and said the government's documents and statements fell short of "concrete evidence." "The government's press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements, heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence -- all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by Dr. Ivins," attorneys Paul Kemp and Thomas M. DeGonia said. Authorities took the unusual step of laying out the case to the public after FBI Director Robert Mueller earlier Wednesday briefed survivors and relatives of victims of the attacks on the investigation. Taylor said Ivins committed suicide last week as federal prosecutors prepared for a meeting with his lawyers to lay out the findings.  Watch Taylor outline the case against Ivins » "We were able to identify in early 2005 the genetically unique parent material of the anthrax spores used in the mailings," Taylor said. "The parent material of the anthrax spores used in the attacks was a single flask of spores, known as RMR-1029, that was created and solely maintained by Dr. Ivins." Ivins spent 28 years as a civilian microbiologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where he was trying to develop a vaccine against anthrax.	1
In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream. Breylan and Terese Hicks play with their sons Bryce, 3, and Jordan, 2. But like many Americans,  Breylan Hicks is having a harder time getting by in the home he built for his family. The couple, who live a mile uptown from their modest neighborhood, had planned to buy a house for $1,700,000, and a year ago, they were driving past their dream home.Today, a $1.7-million home on the edge of the city limits would cost them $743,000.A lot of Americans are having a heck of a time trying to get by in the country's housing bust. Nearly 4.5 million people are unemployed, and many are finding themselves priced out of their homes, unable to afford basic essentials, and forced to turn to the government for help — a reality that becomes more apparent as your income drops.Breylan Hicks and Terese Hicks live in a 2,500-square-foot bungalow on a block of about 20 homes in south Atlanta, on the edge of the neighborhood. In their back yard sits a tree the Hickses planted with money they got from selling their home."When we bought the house, it was $1,700,00. We got almost everything we wanted," Breylan Hicks says. "Here we are, 10 months later, and we have to sell the house because the bank is holding it. The realtor told us to do it, because we don't have a choice."And they'll have to do it with just $60,000 of equity as they try to live out of an 18-month-old car and a bank-issued line-of-credit card that has only enough cash in it to last them for a month.(Photo: CBS)As the housing crisis enters its fifth year, more and more Americans are falling into a cycle that's affecting even some of the country's most affluent neighborhoods.

They were sent to prison for 13 years with no chance of parole.The story of the jury's verdict -- and of the decision to convict the two men -- is important. When a guilty verdict is returned, it is usually followed by an immediate order for the defendants to be brought up on bail pending their appeal to a higher court.In North Carolina, however, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of the two men despite their pleas for clemency.In Mississippi, two men were convicted of a charge that they stole $70,000 from a woman whose life savings was a $40,000 bank deposit.The two men were given lengthy prison sentences with no opportunity for a bond hearing.And in New Jersey, former state Sen.

More than a million anti-government youth gathered for protests in virtually all of Yemen's provinces, witnesses said Friday, a day the protesters dubbed "Friday of victory from God." The largest protest was in Taiz, where more than Â¾ of a million protesters gathered in and around the main mosque. The protesters marched from the mosque through the city as a large crowd chanted "God is great, long live God," and "We want to live in peace." In Aden and all of the south, protesters gathered to show their support for the protesters in the capital, Sanaa. Protesters were also demonstrating in the rest of the country, including in the northern port city of Al Hudaiya.The crowds took to the streets in droves, but organizers of the demonstration were careful to avoid violence and avoid clashes with security forces.At least 80 people were killed in Yemen's unrest, including dozens of demonstrators who died in protests and clashes with security forces, according to the independent al-Masirah television channel. The official death toll has since gone up to over 1,000 people, and many others are believed to have been killed, according to a Reuters count.In Sanaa, anti-government protesters gathered in Jeddah Square, a peaceful demonstration in a city which has been largely calm for the past month, for a third day Friday. The demonstrators were chanting "Allahu Akbar," which can be interpreted several different ways. Most protesters gathered in Jeddah Square and marched to the presidential administration building. Security forces tried to disperse the crowd, but there were no reports of injuries.At Taiz, the largest protests were in the city's main mosque, and they were attended by thousands."The event took place in one of the most beautiful streets in the capital and witnessed the highest turnout in Yemen, with almost 1.3 million people participating in the protest," al-Masirah said, according to Reuters.A Reuters reporter saw protesters in the northern port city of Al Hudaiya waving the Yemeni flag.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany lay in shambles as many businesses went bankrupt and millions of people lost their jobs. Some firms, however, got back on their feet and revived the "Made in Germany" trademark by harnessing the expertise of their workers. Their aim was to become, once again, a global brand. CNN travelled to the town of Glashütte in Saxony, known as the birthplace of the German watchmaking tradition. Here, watchmakers such as A. Lange & Söhne and Nomos Glashütte among others have thrived since the fall of the Wall and have since exported their high-end watches to the rest of the world. German craftsmanship It is companies like these which put their personal, unique stamp on a timeless piece which isn't assembled overnight, explained A. Lange & Söhne. "It takes about four weeks for a watchmaker to put this piece together. And to learn to do this you need about five to ten years of experience," said Marco Wolf, a watchmaker at A. Lange & Söhne, one of the longest-running high-end watchmakers in the world. The hand-crafted timepieces, all mechanical and made with microscopic precision, are carefully created in the former Communist town of Glashütte. "That is what our customers appreciate. The love for details striving for perfection. All that with typical German attributes like solidity, cleanliness, understatement. I think that combination is what drives people and what makes them our customers," said Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Lange & Söhne. Attention to detail goes beyond the surface, according to Schmid, who describes how even tiny parts of the watch the customer will never see are engraved. "And each engraver has his or her own signature style," he added. All in the family The company's namesake, Ferdinand Adolf Lange, founded Glashütte's watchmaking tradition in 1845. The industry flourished and for over a century Glashütte was Germany's watchmaking capital. But all that changed after World War II, when Glashütte suddenly found itself in the Communist east part of Germany. All the watchmaking companies were nationalized and forced to build cheap watches, some of which were secretly sold in the West.	1
No. 1 Florida State re-emerged in the second half and rallied to defeat No. 2 Auburn 34-31 in the BCS National Championship college football game on Monday in Pasadena, California. The Seminoles (13-0) outscored the Tigers (12-2) 24-10 after halftime to win their third national title. It was FSU's second BCS crown and third national title. Heisman Trophy winner and FSU quarterback Jameis Winston was 20-for-35 for 237 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner to Kelvin Benjamin with 13 seconds remaining. More great photos from the championship game The fourth quarter turned into a back-and-forth affair. The final 24 points of the game were scored in the last 4:42 of the game. The Tigers appeared to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a go-ahead touchdown on a determined 37-yard scamper with 1:19 left in the game. But led by Winston, the Seminoles drove 80 yards in seven plays to grab the crown. Who will win next year's championship? FSU's rally included Levonte Whitfield's 100-yard kickoff return with 4:31 left to put Florida State ahead. The extra point made it 27-24. Tigers take halftime lead After an early FSU field goal, Auburn scored three straight touchdowns to take a 21-3 lead. But Florida State's Devonta Freeman scored on a 3-yard run with 1:28 left in the first half to cut the deficit at intermission to 11. That FSU drive was kept alive by a fourth-down end-around out of punt formation. The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by FSU kicker Roberto Aguayo. He also made a 35-yarder in the first period. FSU also got a fourth-quarter TD from Chad Abram on a 11-yard reception with 10:55 remaining. Final BCS game: Thanks for the memories Auburn kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 left made the score 24-20. Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall threw for two touchdowns and ran for one. He was 14-for-27 for 216 yards and one interception. Mason ran for 195 yards on 34 carries.	1

England went into the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday after a dramatic late 16-12 victory over Scotland at Eden Park in New Zealand. Needing to win by more than seven points to reach the last eight, England lost three times in a row in a bid to stop Scotland winning their first World Cup title in 40 years. Scotland, chasing a sixth World Cup title, won 24-21 at home to South Africa, while England's run-in came to an end in the last quarter of the match when they were beaten 17-5.In the end, they finished with 13 consecutive wins to reach the final. The tournament, the brainchild of Andrew McInnes, had been in the balance all year when England and Wales failed to qualify from Pool C, while Scotland and South Africa, who would have qualified directly, met in the other semi-final. The final is being played this evening.In the last-16 match, England began strongly, going up 0-3 thanks to a try from Tom Croft. After that, however, they fell apart. After going ahead with a try from Luke Narraway and a penalty from the Welsh full-back, Scotland reduced the deficit to 13-9 in the 34th minute but Scotland only got a consolation try out in the final minute. It was a great victory for Scotland, who were ranked third in the world during the tournament.This morning, it was announced that Scotland's victory means they are the third country to win the tournament and their best result in the competition so far after New Zealand's victory over Japan last week. Their campaign was a true reflection of the work of McInnes, whose first idea was to create a "World Cup knockout tournament" in 2008. The tournament is designed to allow some of the top teams to compete more regularly.Scotland will now go into the semi-finals where they will face either New Zealand or England with the possibility of a play-off.The last-16 draw was held today, with one team already eliminated, and one team yet to be decided.

Three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the United States, House and Senate committees Thursday put Congress on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund Âas solvent as possible at the end of the current fiscal year,Â according to Democratic and Republican leaders. ÂWe feel good about where we are right now and are very optimistic of a deal that could put our country on a more sustainable path,Â said Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-MO) ÂWe look forward to working with our colleagues over the course of the next week in a bipartisan manner to get us to that goal.ÂThe House panel that oversees Highway Trust Fund operations, by a vote of 39-39, approved a measure to pay up to $350 million for repairs to U.S. roads and bridges over the next three years ÂWe were very pleased that the committee leadership did not want to wait to move forward, rather, they felt it was more prudent to work through the first steps of the process now,Â said Rep. Bart Gordon (D-TN).Democratic leaders had planned to schedule a floor vote on the bill Wednesday, but decided to put the bill on hold for the time being. ÂI would feel confident about getting it out on the floor today, but we want to make sure it can pass the House of Representatives,Â said Rep.

An Alaska judge has denied Bristol Palin's request that her court fight with ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston over custody of their son be kept private to avoid a "media circus." The daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is seeking full custody at a hearing Wednesday afternoon. Bristol Palin had sued Johnston -- who is serving an eight-year prison sentence for assault in his current life sentence -- and the pair’s attorney in Alaska Superior Court, seeking to dissolve a temporary restraining order against her. At a pre-trial hearing in May, jurors said they were deadlocked 4-4 on the question of whether Johnston made an inappropriate sexual advance toward her. The judge decided Wednesday afternoon that the media circus that has surrounded the dispute is not worth it and that the jury’s 4-4 split is not worthy of an Alaskan grand jury. “My decision that they don't want a lot of the ugly details out of their life is based on the amount of interest that they're getting in it,” Superior Court Judge Michael Stenehjem said. Palin spokeswoman Megan Mitchell said that the court is letting the media get into the dispute because it will “bring attention to it.” “It’s not something that they want to get out,” Mitchell said. Palin is seeking full custody of her son with Johnston, Cayden, who is now 8. Palin is seeking $16 million in attorney fees, and Johnston, whose $12.77 million suit against her was denied by the court, would have to pay her $895,000. He is also seeking to be awarded more than $7 million in pain and suffering and mental anguish.Palin lawyer: Media circus over child custody in Alaska By Kelli Kennedy in Wasilla, Alaska 01/23/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A few hundred protesters gathered Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, calling for a civil state and an end to military rule. The rally began after iftar, the evening meal that marks the breaking of the fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, and was organized by Egyptian activists, political groups and a few of the country's Sufi orders. It was a protest meant not only to highlight the importance of unity, but also to contrast the message of a massive demonstration that took place in the same location in late July -- one that had brought out tens of thousands of Islamists demanding the implementation of Islamic law in Egypt. During Friday's rally, many participants chanted slogans such as, "No terrorism, no sectarianism, Egypt is a civil state," "Peaceful, peaceful", and "Down with military rule." Egyptian Sufi leader Alaa Eddin Abu el-Azayem, who addressed the crowd later in the evening, told his audience, "An Egyptian civil state is the only choice for Egypt." Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam. Brief clashes broke out earlier between protesters and security forces -- at one point both sides were throwing rocks and bottles at one another. Calm was restored a few moments later. Last Friday, a non-violent protest in Tahrir Square quickly turned chaotic, as the demonstrators were chased by military through surrounding streets.	1
An Illinois woman and her boyfriend, already charged with aiding in the abduction of the woman's 6-year-old grandson, face new charges of tampering with a witness in the case, officials said Tuesday. Ricky Chekevdia, 6, allegedly was hidden with his mother in a secret room in his grandmother's house. Diane Dobbs and Robert Sandefur, both 51, are in jail pending the filing of formal charges in the case, said Beth Sandusky, victim services coordinator for the state attorney's office in Franklin County, Illinois. The two were charged previously with aiding and abetting child abduction, a felony, according to Sandusky and court records. They were released from jail on bond Monday, but were back in custody within hours, according to ABC News and CNN affiliate WSIL. Last week, authorities found Ricky Chekevdia, Dobbs' grandson, at her home. The boy was hiding along with his mother, Shannon Wilfong, in a secret room built to hide them -- an area about 5 feet by 12 feet, with a 4-foot ceiling, according to WSIL. Police say the boy had been hidden for nearly two years. Wilfong, 30, is jailed on felony child abduction charges and made her first court appearance Tuesday, Sandusky said. "We let him out of the car and he ran around like he'd never seen the outdoors," Master Sgt. Stan Diggs with the Illinois State Police told WSIL. "It was actually very sad." In an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Monday, before she was arrested, Dobbs disputed the accusation that Ricky was hidden in the small room, saying that in two years he spent "maybe five minutes" there. "My grandson had the run of the house," she said. "When we were outside, we would go fishing, we would do weenie roasts. We've done fireworks on the Fourth of July. He's helped me plant my flower garden in the back." She said she would not plead guilty to the charges. "We were on our own and we had to do what we had to do and that was make sure our grandson was safe," Dobbs said. Sandusky would not comment on the pending charges against Dobbs and Sandefur or identify the witness. However, a woman told WSIL she called police after Dobbs and Sandefur came onto her property and threatened her son's life.	1
The exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamic faction Hamas met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday in his first official trip to Jordan since his expulsion in 1999. In a statement issued by Hamas, Khaled Meshaal expressed his appreciation to the king for supporting Palestinians. "Any future meetings between Hamas and Jordan open a new page between the two sides and serve the Palestinian cause," said Meshaal, who announced earlier this month that he would not seek another term as president of the movement's governing body. The meeting comes as Abdullah is making a high-profile attempt to broker new peace talks in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas, which the United States and the European Union consider a terrorist organization, controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza and refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist. Meshaal met with Abdullah and the crown prince of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. Abdullah reaffirmed his support for a Palestinian state based on the borders drawn before the 1967 Middle East war, "with East Jerusalem as its capital," Petra reported. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its own capital, and its ultimate status is one of the most contentious points in the talks. But Abdullah also called negotiations "the sole means to regain Palestinian rights," a stance Israel and the United States have supported as Palestinian leaders seek recognition of an independent Palestine at the United Nations. And Petra said Meshaal called the meetings "a new opening" after 12 years, stating Hamas respected "Jordan's security, stability and interests." Jordan kicked the leadership of Hamas out of the country in 1999 after accusing it of breaking a deal to restrict its activity to politics. The movement has maintained a headquarters in Syria's capital Damascus since then, receiving financial and military support from the governments of Hafez al-Assad and his successor, his son Bashar. But Hamas has been distancing itself from its long-time patron as Syria battles a 10-month-old popular uprising against al-Assad. Hamas personnel and their families have left Syria in recent weeks, and Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, did not stop in Damascus during a recent regional trip.	1
Sebastian Vettel became Formula One's youngest world champion in a five-way shootout at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2010, and the German needs just one point in Japan this weekend to seal a second world crown. Vettel's dominant form in 2011 has led him to victory in nine of 14 races so far, and the 24-year-old is on the brink of becoming the ninth driver to secure back-to-back titles in the championship's 61-year history. If he does so, the celebrations will come with four races to go -- putting Vettel narrowly behind his legendary compatriot Michael Schumacher, who set the standard in 2002 when he clinched the fifth of his record seven world titles with six of the 17 races remaining. Vettel will also become the youngest double world champion, beating the 25-year-old Fernando Alonso's feat with Renault in 2005-06. Latest F1 standings after Singapore GP Former Toro Rosso driver Vettel needs to earn a 10th-place finish, or higher, in one of the season's five remaining grands prix to complete his triumph. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button, second in the drivers' standings, is the only driver who still has a mathematical chance of preventing Red Bull celebrations on Sunday. British racer Button would need the unlikely combination of Vettel to score no further world championship points, while also winning the year's five remaining races. Despite Vettel knowing he could win the title with an uncharacteristically low finish -- he has finished outside of the top two in just one race this year -- the one-time Sauber driver insisted he is fully focused on claiming another maximum 25-point haul. "Obviously there's still a chance for Jenson to win the title and for me not to win the title," Vettel told Formula One's official website. "Even if it's only one point. "The moment you decide to fly, sooner or later there's a moment when you will come down as well. You have to, nothing flies for ever. I think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage, the target going into this weekend is not to get one point, in a way it's not to win the championship, the target is to do our best.	1

The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for the wrongs of slavery. The nonbinding resolution sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is similar to a House resolution adopted last year that acknowledged the wrongs of slavery but offered no reparations. The House will have to vote on the issue again because the composition of that chamber changed after last November's elections. The resolution was approved on a voice vote. Because it is nonbinding, it does not have to be forwarded to the president for his signature. Several states have passed similar resolutions, but the House resolution was the first time a branch of the federal government did so. Harkin's resolution "acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery, and Jim Crow laws," and "apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws." Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enacted mostly in U.S. Southern and border states between the 1870s and 1965 that denied African-Americans the right to vote and other civil liberties, as well as legally segregated them from whites. Some members of the African-American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendants of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery.	1
Every time the door bell rings at Aidan Licata's home, the 6-year-old fears the gunman has returned. He worries the man in black fatigues and military-style vest who opened fire Friday on his Sandy Hook ers will re-enter the school or the neighboring elementary school. He's not alone; police chief John Pode said it's happened nearly every day since Dec. 14, when a gunman fatally shot 20 children and six educators. "It's just like a movie," says Aidan. "I just sit here thinking, 'Maybe this is the next one.'" The first time was when he was at his grandparents' home. The same man, according to Sgt. William McManus, who is an eyewitness to the attack. "He was parked in their driveway," McManus says. "I was walking by and started videotaping him. By the time I got my camera out, he had already gone up the block."Advertisement HideThe Second TimeA police officer was sitting at a desk talking with a teacher about 10 or 15 minutes before the attack began. "He was sitting there with a book," McManus says. "And he says, 'Oh, by the way, I'm gonna stop by that old church.' And he just drove up there and opened fire on the front door. He said, 'I just thought, I'm so high, I'm not really thinking, I just went to get some money, to come up here and shoot up this old church.' And he pulled out his silencer and started spraying the whole place with bullets." A gunman on the run, McManus adds, "might be going with an active shooter plan." The second time was at the Sandy Hook elementary school. "He was parked in the same spot as he was parked at the church," McManus says, referring to a spot along the road where the gunmen opened fire on the school, "and he saw kids walking by, so he started shooting." A cop stopped him and he was tackled. "It's the kids that make it really painful, being shot," says Licata. "You never think you're going to shoot a kid, then you shoot one of them. It's just like somebody hitting him. I feel like we should never have let him go."Advertisement HideA TeacherAnother teacher saw the first massacre unfold and raced to the	0
Police are searching for any other alleged victims of a Sunday school teacher accused of raping and killing an 8-year-old girl from Tracy, California. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter. "We are asking the public if they have any indication that any of their children may have had inappropriate contact with [the suspect] to contact us," Tracy Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman said Tuesday evening. "There has been no indication that this has happened. But she is a Sunday school teacher and did have contact with children, so that is why we are asking." Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, a friend of her 5-year-old daughter. Huckaby, wearing red jail scrubs over a white T-shirt, was in court Tuesday for an arraignment. She was charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14 and rape by instrument. If convicted, Huckaby would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing. A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later, he said. Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times. Sandra's body was found April 6, stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police. Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her daughter. The two children were close friends and played together frequently, police said. Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police have said. The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra's disappearance and death. Before her arrest, Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra's body. But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen. Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case, saying evidence would be presented in court.	1
Chelsea moved quickly to replace the sacked Roberto Di Matteo Wednesday as Rafael Benitez was appointed as interim manager until the end of the season. The English Premier League side made the announcement on their official website, just hours after the departure of Di Matteo, who had led them to European Champions League glory for the first time earlier this year. Former Valencia and Liverpool manager Benitez will be thrown in at the deep end, with Chelsea taking on EPL reigning champions and leaders Manchester City Sunday. "The owner and the Board believe that in Benitez we have a manager with significant experience at the highest level of football, who can come in and immediately help deliver our objectives," read the club statement. "The 52-year-old Spaniard is due to meet the players at the training ground in Cobham tomorrow (Thursday)," it added. Benitez, who will be the ninth manager under owner Roman Abramovich, has been out of work since being sacked by Inter Milan in December 2010. He guided Valencia to two Spanish titles and the UEFA Cup and spent six years at Liverpool, highlighted by their Champions League triumph in 2005 and reaching the final in 2007. Former Barcelona manager Pepe Guardiola has been linked with the Chelsea job, but is currently on a year-long sabbatical after leaving the Catalan giants at the end of last season. Di Matteo, who also won the FA Cup with Chelsea during his brief spell in charge, paid the price for a poor recent run of results, culminating in a 3-0 defeat to Juventus Tuesday which leaves their participation in the knockout stages of this season's Champions League in considerable doubt.	1
Get too far out of line aboard an international flight and you could be restrained in your seat with zip ties and duct tape. That appears to be what happened to a disruptive male passenger aboard a flight from Iceland to New York on Thursday after a photo surfaced on social media showing a man bound to his seat. Iceland Air said it could not confirm the validity of the photo, but said there was "an incident with a passenger on the flight from Reykjavik to New York" in which the passenger was restrained. The man was "hitting, screaming and spitting at other passengers, while yelling profanities," according to airline spokesman Michael Raucheisen, who said the passenger's "behavior was considered to be unruly and threatening." "To ensure the safety of those on board, he was restrained by passengers and crew and was monitored for his own safety for the duration of the flight," he added. The man was arrested after the flight arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, the airline said. The Port Authority said the man was not charged and was taken to a local hospital. Raucheisen said duct tape and plastic zip ties are considered standard protocol when restraining a passenger. "This equipment is on board all our flights in case an incident like this arises," he said. A photo posted on Facebook by a fellow passenger showed a man tied to the back of his seat with his legs tied together, and tape on his ankles and over his mouth.

It used to be one of the great sights in tennis -- the likes of Boris Becker and John McEnroe flying around the net, executing flawless volleys to follow up precision serves. But the fearsome hitting power of modern tennis players has destroyed an art once finessed by some of Wimbledon's greatest champions, according to eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl. Czech legend Lendl believes the bold playing style -- mastered to thrilling effect on grass by legends such as Rod Laver, Stefan Edberg, Martina Navratilova and Pat Rafter -- has been outdated by advances in technology and training. "The reason the guys don't serve and volley is mainly because of the spin on the ball that is given by the string and also by the strength of the guys and their technique," Lendl told CNN. "So to come to the net and be fishing for that ball when the guy takes a full swing and it has 8,000 rpm on that ball ... it becomes very, very difficult to volley and put away." In the next two weeks, Lendl is chasing the Wimbledon title -- the only grand slam that eluded him as a player -- as a coach for British number one Andy Murray. But Lendl, who is now a U.S. citizen, appears unlikely to encourage the Scot to make frequent forays from the baseline. Murray relishes Wimbledon's home comforts "There are only a handful of guys that can do it right now -- Roger (Federer) being one of them," Lendl said. But even Federer, whose serve-and-volley prowess helped secure six Wimbledon titles, has abandoned the technique. Tim Henman, a four-time Wimbledon semifinalist and one of the few players of his generation to embrace the serve-and-volley game, thinks Federer has been forced to adapt his style at the London venue. "He used to (serve and volley), but I think the conditions of the grass have changed so much -- the balls are probably heavier, the courts are much, much slower, so there is far less serve and volley," Henman told CNN. However, the former British number one maintains that coming to the net can pay off at Wimbledon, adding: "I think you've got to really keep attacking on grass, it's the hardest surface to defend on."

The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client "completely unsubstantiated." Appearing Saturday  in front of the New York City Criminal Court, defense lawyer Anthony D. Messer said he has "no evidence whatsoever" to link two young men to a plot to kill the doctor."In no way would I say that anything I saw or heard would indicate that he was a threat to the public health or safety." Messer told The Associated Press."I think it's preposterous that he would be considered a person of interest," he said.On Friday, court papers were filed linking him to a "highly organized, sophisticated scheme" to have his colleague, Dr. Thomas Zumoff, "killed or injured" at least once, according to the papers obtained by The Associated Press. In interviews, Messer said he has no evidence to support any of the accusations in the court papers.Zumoff is an anesthesiologist who practices in the affluent suburbs of New York. He has a medical license and is not licensed to perform abortions, the papers said. He is a member of a medical guild, whose members are supposed to provide quality medical care, an organization that has been accused by pro-lifers of trying to subvert the licensing system.ADVERTISEMENTMost Popular StoriesMesser said he doesn't even know his client."We have had no contact," he said "We were not in contact. We have met in court."He says he represents four other defendants in cases involving the practice of medicine, which he says is a "farce and a sham."In court papers, the men accused one another of conspiring to "intentionally damage the reputation of another with the intent of causing serious emotional harm."Messer said he is seeking "the court's approval of a motion to sever the defendants in this case from other defendants because of the serious consequences of the court's failure to sever these cases." He said the court should sever the trials of the other defendants on the same grounds. "The other defendants are not involved in this case and they have nothing to do with it," Messer said.Messer said his client is a first-year resident who received his medical degree from the University	0
A 19-year-old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, left a suicide note, police said. Police have identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins, 19, of The incident began when police were called to a reported mass shooting at the Westroads Mall, in downtown Omaha. They soon learned that there had been many other similar incidents, and that the suspect had killed eight people in his apartment before shooting himself.Hospitals across the country reported treating at least two victims who had died of their wounds at the mall. Police identified the shooter as Robert A. Hawkins, who lived with his father in the apartment where the shooting happened.Tennis player Dimitrov, who is ranked third in men's singles at the French Open, did not have to go to the hospital after sustaining a cut on his right foot during a warm-up match. The cut was cleaned and stitched by a medical staff member.Police in the central Ukrainian city of Luhansk earlier said a pro-Russian rebel took part in the shooting, but they added that he was killed by other gunmen.The shootings came after a mass shooting at a California synagogue in which one person was killed and seven wounded.In September, a mass shooting at a high school in Sandy Hook, Connecticut left 26 people dead. The massacre came as President Donald Trump was visiting the United Air Lines at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, where he was to attend a campaign rally.New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has asked for an urgent meeting with the country's top security and intelligence officials to discuss the shooting and other attacks in Australia.The shooting was also the second at a Melbourne mall in three months. A gunman killed two people at the Bourke Street Mall in March, during a shopping trip.The shooter was shot dead by police after the rampage. "A female and a male are being interviewed by police, it's at this stage unclear whether they are related to the incident," a police spokesman said in a statement.Two victims in the shooting said the gunman told them to say a prayer, then killed two people and a woman before killing himself.He told two victims "This is the end I'm going to do it", before shooting his parents.A number of people, including the shooter's mother, were	0
Iran is to send a female skier to the Winter Olympics for the first time at next year's Games in Vancouver, Canada, the head of the Islamic Republic's ski federation told state media Monday. Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari, competing at last month's World Ski Championships, in France. The chosen competitor will ski in "full Islamic dress," Iran's National News Agency reported. Three women Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari, Mitra Kalhor and Marjan Kalhor are vying for the place on the national team alongside three male skiers, said Iranian Ski Federation head Isa Saveh-Shemshaki. Trials for the team will be held in December, two months ahead of the event. Iran has sent male athletes to every Winter Games since 1956. Skiing is hugely popular in Iran with some of the region's best slopes in the Zagros Mountains just a two-hour drive from the country's capital Tehran. At weekends during the seven-month ski season it is common to see long queues of traffic on routes to resorts. With a growing ski tourism industry, the price of the sport has steadily increased. But with fewer social restrictions on the pistes than in other areas of Iranian life, the sport remains a popular pursuit for the country's youth. Until recently, many slopes were strictly segregated with men and women skiing on different sides of the mountain. But while it is still illegal to travel in the same chair lift or gondola, the country's strict religious laws are visibly more lax at 3,000 meters. Iran took just three women among 53 athletes to last year's Beijing Olympics but the choice of 19-year-old female rower Homa Hosseini to carry the flag during the opening ceremony infuriated strict Islamists. Current president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who faces an election this year, was forced to back down from an initiative ealry in his current term to encourage female participation in sport because of criticism from the country's religious leaders. One mullah reportedly said that women should not ski because the movement of their knees looked "more like dancing than sport."	1
An Australian-run orphanage in Cambodia suspected of beating and neglecting the children in its care has been shut down by local authorities. The Love in Action orphanage in Phnom Penh was raided on Friday by local officials and staff from Australian anti-trafficking group South East Asia Investigations into Social and Humanitarian Activities (SISHA), SISHA said. A government spokesman confirmed to CNN that the orphanage "did not meet requirements" and was under investigation by the country's courts but gave no further details. Twenty one children, including babies, were rescued but seven remain unaccounted for and the orphanage is now under investigation for human trafficking, child abuse, neglect and running an unregistered institution. According to its website, the Christian orphanage was run by Ruth Golder, an Australian woman, and received most of its funding from donations. A statement from SISHA said the woman has admitted to police that her orphanage was not registered and she had no legal authority to care for the children. Her current whereabouts are not known but a spokesperson for SISHA said she had not been arrested or charged in the case. The raid came after two groups of children recently fled from the orphanage and reported that they were beaten and neglected. An official inspection found that "some children were visibly ill and not taken to a doctor, the facility was dirty, sewage was blocked and the living quarters were overcrowded," the statement from SISHA said. In interviews, children said they had been physically abused by staff at the orphanage. "This marks the first time the Cambodian criminal justice and social services mechanisms have used due process to close an institution on short notice," the statement added. Steve Morrish, managing director of SISHA, said that many orphanages in Cambodia were unregulated and had a financial incentive to increase the number of children they look after as it means they receive more funding from international donors. "They call themselves orphanages but in many cases the children are not orphans. They have one or both parents, who are just very poor." Recruiters are known to approach poor and rural families, saying they can offer their children education, food, clothing and a chance for a better life, he said.	1
Already packing 110 mph winds, a hurricane churning in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico is forecast to get even stronger -- though, as of now, it poses no direct threat to those onshore. Hurricane Emilia may "become a major hurricane" -- or a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds in excess of 111 mph -- "later today or tonight," the National Hurricane Center reported in its 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) advisory. At that time, the eye of the storm was about 680 miles (1,095 kilometers) south of the southern tip of Baja California in western Mexico. It was progressing west-northwest at 15 mph, a rate of movement that is expected to slow slightly "over the next couple of days," according to the Miami-based weather agency. No coastal watches or warnings have been issued because of Emilia, and the hurricane center did not indicate if it is expected to hit or even approach land. As is, steady tropical storm force winds of 39 mph or stronger extend out up to 125 miles from the hurricane's eye. Hurricane winds of 74 mph and more are blowing within 35 miles of the storm's center. Past 12 months warmest recorded in United States Emilia isn't the only hurricane spinning in the eastern Pacific. The other is Hurricane Daniel, which had sustained winds of 75 mph as of 2 p.m. But that storm was even farther from land -- its eye situated about 1,450 miles west-southwest of Baja California's southern tip and 1,635 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii -- and likewise hadn't prompted any coastal watches or warnings. Daniel weakened over the course of the day Monday and was expected to lose even more potency over the next two days, according to the National Hurricane Center.	1
Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday. The incident resulted in "multiple" reports of overdoses. Some of the iced or spiked drinks were intended for younger women, though they were mixed with alcohol intended for men."It's a very serious problem. It's just another example of the overall unsafe environment we live in," UW spokesman Matt Brown said. "There are lots of different reasons we're seeing this issue. One is it's the way society is."The UW student paper of record, the Daily UW Report, reported Saturday that the party was held at the Student Union in downtown Pullman."I drank more than I should have and felt like I was in a great party," one of the women who reported an overdose told the paper.One of the students who was allegedly assaulted told the station that spiked drinks were available at the party, which was held on a Thursday, and that the partygoers said they thought the spiked drinks were a good idea."I was just shocked that this party had alcohol," one of those students told the TV station.Other students said the spiked drinks provided to young women were made with wine.The university's Office of Safe and Healthy Communities is monitoring the situation, and the university is providing students with sobering information on this and other dangerous trends, Brown said."We continue to work with police and all our partners on this incident," he said.In the hours after the party, police and campus officials were interviewing students and asking them to report any other instances of spiked drinks.Wendy Duch, UW's associate vice president for community and student affairs, said the university would review what steps it must take in response to the incident, and will work with police and the school's alcohol program to develop a plan to prevent such crimes."We've been very clear about making sure students know the consequences of drinking to excess," she said. "We are committed to making sure our young people have a safe place to drink and to talk about what the consequences could happen."The campus' alcohol program has an alcohol compliance officer and a "specialist in spiked drinks," she said, and both monitor the campus' bars."We also work regularly with campus police, as well as our alcohol compliance officer	0
Colton Harris-Moore returned Thursday to a setting with which he is all-too-acquainted: a Washington State courtroom. After two years on the run, Harris-Moore, 19, heard the charge and possible jail time he faces for stealing a plane. The teen had been on the run since he walked away from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. Harris-Moore has already been charged with over a dozen crimes such as fleeing from police officers in a stolen car, identity thefts, burglaries and taking a four seater Cessna plane for a joyride, even though he doesn't have a pilot's license and never apparently took any flying lessons. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.  At the hearing, Harris-Moore's attorney did not contest his continued detention and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. If a grand jury hands up an indictment in the plane case, Harris-Moore would next appear at an arraignment to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. Before he gained notoriety as the brazen "barefoot bandit," Harris-Moore was a wayward boy who despite frequent run-ins with the law, behavior modifying medication, pleas from relatives and psychological counseling could not stay out of trouble. 'Let down' A CNN review of more than a thousand pages of court documents painted a different picture of the now infamous outlaw. The records instead show Harris-Moore running from his demons and what a psychologist's report called "a home situation marked by instability, loss and alcohol abuse." "He was let down," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann told CNN. "He was neglected by the schools, the police and his immediate family. He didn't have a normal life, he had an alcoholic mom and her boyfriends." Read the aunt's letter to the court According to Puttmann, her sister drank heavily and regularly broke Harris-Moore's toys as a form of punishment while he was growing up. In court records, Harris-Moore tells a psychologist his mother acted "mean" when drinking and "she will break my things. She yells and screams at me." Harris-Moore's mother, Pamela Kohler, did not respond to CNN's calls, emails and a letter asking for comment on the allegations.	1

Nine-year old Kayla Hope loves fairy tales, especially "Cinderella." "It's got a lot of rats!" she giggles, burying her face in her hands. They're her favorite part. Until now, she's never read a book. She would  like, she wants to read a book. "I want a book about unicorns! How about a unicorn book? I wanna read the one about unicorns and unicorns and unicorns!"I don't blame her. I didn't read a book when I was nine. Not like she did. She has a "book" of every single Disney princess. Every single princess, she's got a book. Each book has a color. A girl can be pink, purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, teal, and gold. This is her collection of the princesses from Disney:"Wow!" she cries. She stares at me. "What are you, my math teacher, then? 'Scuse me, Miss Cute?' I'm not math." She's shaking her head. She doesn't want to talk about the books she's reading but she doesn't know why. She doesn't know why I'm not her math teacher. She can't understand. I'm the one who read her a book. I'm the one who gave her her "book." My book, my math book."I'd like to read a book about unicorns," I say. My voice is soft. It doesn't sound like a teacher's voice. Even though I know how the book is and it sounds like something I would read to her. I don't want to have to explain everything to her. Maybe she'll just nod and smile and take another sip of her juice. Then I'll be on my merry way. I'll go home."Uh uh!" she squeals. "My princess books are all about princesses!" She grabs her stomach and starts to cry. "I wanna read about unicorns! Unicorns!" She starts shaking her head. Tears are running down her face. She starts getting loud. "Unicorns!" She's screaming.

Inter Milan took a stranglehold on the Serie A title with a 3-0 win over Cagliari on Sunday which saw them open a 10-point lead over city rivals AC Mlan, who could only manage a goalless draw at Bologna. Roma's later 1-0 win at Fiorentina, with Mirko Vucinic scoring the only goal, saw them move into second place above Milan, eight points adrift of Inter but having played a game more. Milan's draw continue their disappointing form which began with a defeat in the derby match against reigning champions Inter two weeks ago. Since then they have drawn their next two matches, with Inter taking full advantage, although they are facing a renewed challenge from Roma, who have gone 12 games without defeat. Goals from Goran Pandev, Walter Samuel and Diego Milito earned Jose Mourinho's Inter side a comfortable victory in the San Siro, taking the lead after just six minutes. Samuel Eto'o, playing his first game since returning from Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon, set up Pandev to score at the near post. The second came after 20 minutes as central defender Samuel headed home a Maicon corner. Cagliari had a goal chalked off for offside which TV replays showed should have stood and Julio Cesar pulled off a brilliant save to deny fellow Brazilian Nene. There hopes of a revival were ended in the early stages of the second half as a neet move involving Eto'o and the excellent Pandev saw Milito score the third. Milan had the better chances at Bologna and Ronaldinho hit the crossbar with a spectacular effort in the second half.  Late on, captain Mansion Ambrosia also saw an effort rebound off the woodwork. In other action, Antonio Di Natale scored a hat-trick for Udinese in a 3-1 home win win over Champions League aspirants Napoli. At the other end of the table, rock-bottom Siena lost 2-1 to Sampdoria, who are also chasing a European place, while troubled Lazio slipped into the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at home to Catania. In the German Bundesliga,  Eintracht Frankfurt jumped to seventh with a fine 3-2 away win over Borussia Dortmund.	1
An Air Force squadron commander has been removed a week after a tilt-rotor CV-22 Osprey crashed in Florida during a routine training mission, injuring five, military officials said Friday. Officials were no longer confident in his effectiveness, said Col. Jim Slife, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing. "The challenges of the 8th Special Operations Squadron's demanding mission require new leadership to maintain the highest levels of precision and to reliably support the ground forces which count on the 8th SOS to safely accomplish their missions," Slife said in a statement, without providing details. Lt. Col. Matt Glover of Austin, Texas, had led the 8th Special Operations Squadron since May 2011, according to the Hurlburt Field website. The squadron is one of nine operating in the wing. Slife said the new squadron commander has extensive history in the Osprey program. The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. June 13 at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The cause remains under investigation, Slife said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two more crashes: one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered, and the craft resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006. The Marines deployed them in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development.	1
The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at his murder trial, according to a decision released by the trial judge on Tuesday. In early January, the fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team. "It allows the prosecutor to force her to testify in front of the jury without taking the Fifth" (Amendment against self incrimination), CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said of the order. "If she lies, she can still be prosecuted for perjury because a grant of immunity never (immunizes) someone against committing perjury on the witness stand." Hernandez, the former tight end who once had a $40 million contract, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Odin Lloyd. He has also pleaded not guilty to weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Jenkins has been a regular at hearings for Hernandez. He has often been seen mouthing "I love you" to her. Jenkins is on the prosecution's witness list. It is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt Hernandez. "Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love," said Callan, a former New York homicide prosecutor. But there is no privilege in Massachusetts allowing engaged couples to avoid testifying against one another. Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.  According to court documents, she doesn't remember where. Her sister was the girlfriend of the victim and has already testified against Hernandez. Prosecutors said Jenkins, Hernandez's high school sweetheart, lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was less than a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Jenkins' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors.	1

The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday to find a constitutional balance between free speech and privacy in a case involving provocative anti-homosexual protests by a small church at the funeral of a soldier who died in Iraq. Members of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church protested outside the court, while inside one of their members argued they have the right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars. But the lawyer for the fallen Marine's father argued those protests are an invasion of privacy and an intentional infliction of emotional distress. "[Justice] Brandeis said the right to be let alone was the most important, and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort [lawsuit] there for interference with privacy," said Justice Stephen Breyer, speaking for many of his colleagues. "And emotional injury, deliberately inflicted, could be one. ... But I see that in some instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from getting out a public message, and therefore, I'm looking for a line." At issue is a delicate test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest. The church, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believes God is punishing the United States for "the sin of homosexuality" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as "Thank God for dead soldiers," "God blew up the troops" and "AIDS cures fags." Westboro members had appeared outside the 2006 funeral for Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Maryland, outside Baltimore. Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were later reduced to $5 million. The church appealed the case in 2008 to the 4th District, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's allegations that its First Amendment rights were violated. Albert Snyder, Matthew's father, said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral. "I was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being," Snyder told CNN. "I mean, it was inhuman."	1
As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news  briefing as he discusses Iraq with reporters on Capitol Hill, Sept. 25, 2003. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news  briefing as he discusses Iraq with reporters on Capitol Hill, Sept. 25, 2003. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)WASHINGTON, Sept. 25, 2003 — President Bush’s advisers say that President Bush’s decision to wait for a progress report on the war in Iraq from the United Nations will likely prove a wise one.The president’s message to Congress is designed to persuade lawmakers to go along with an Aug. 15 deadline for a status report from U.N. Iraq envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. The delay gives time for Bush to make up his mind on pulling out.Congress will have to act shortly after an Aug. 15 deadline expires. A decision by Congress would force Bush into a national election within a few months, thus potentially increasing the prospect of a major political setback.The White House has been working on an exit strategy for the last week or so, trying to persuade Iraq hawks from around the country that an exit would be a good idea, and at the same time working against any pressure from the anti-war and anti-endorsement forces.In doing so, the administration has been negotiating with the main anti-war groups on Capitol Hill and with conservative and liberal commentators and analysts in the media.In a series of interviews with The Associated Press, some of which included The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, Bush’s top aides offered their observations of some of the most important decisions that have come to light in the run-up to the Aug. 15 deadline.The administration has repeatedly insisted that the Aug. 15 deadline represents the administration’s final decision, which means that it has lost, and not the United Nations, the key to winning support for withdrawal.“In our view, it is the final deadline,” said one senior administration official.Another former administration official said that, as opposed to what was expected, it is “not as much pressure from the left and	0
Texas Gov. Rick Perry will immediately send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to help secure the southern border, where tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America have crossed into the United States this year in a surge that is deemed ilegal under a federal court settlement.Perry's decision Friday comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's decision to send 1,000 troops to the border in response to the surge. The governor's decision came after hours-long negotiations with Democratic congressional leaders as well as the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.The governor's decision is the latest example of the administration's efforts to push to a stalemate a deal on the immigration crisis that has emerged over the past week. Administration officials say the immigration system is broken and should be fixed by cracking down on undocumented immigrants. But top Republicans and Democratic leaders insist the only way to fix the nation's immigration system is to legalize those already in the United States lawfully.A handful of Democrats have also said they would support a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.While Perry will send the National Guard troops on Monday, Texas lawmakers will be left with several days of political limbo when the Republican-controlled Legislature convenes on Tuesday.The governor said in a statement that "Texas is ground zero in the immigration crisis and I will do my part to help secure our southern border against potential threats." He added that "the United States should not be allowing people to enter from Mexico unchecked."Perry's announcement immediately drew widespread praise from Democrats, who suggested the action would begin to close the gap between Trump and lawmakers on immigration policy."Here in Texas, Governor Perry has struck a balance between the need to protect our border, secure the children, and ensure public safety," said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo. "The federal government shouldn't have the power or authority to ignore Texas laws while sending National Guard troops to the border."The governor said about 5,000 people who have crossed into the United States illegally under federal protection have requested entry to Texas.He said he would deploy up to 1,000 active and reserve active-duty active-duty guardsmen, whose members have been trained to "prevent the unlawful entry of unaccompanied children, and to respond to an incident or threat of unlawful entry."The announcement came just hours after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters	0
Sarah Murnaghan, the Philadelphia girl who underwent a lung transplant last week following a court battle, is out of a coma and responsive. The 10-year-old woke up Friday night, said Tracy Simon, a family spokeswoman. Although she remains on a ventilator and is unable to talk, she is nodding and shaking her head in response to questions, Simon said. Prior to her surgery, Sarah, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, was put in a medically induced coma to allow her body needed rest prior to the transplant surgery. Her family fought to allow children to compete with adults waiting for lungs based on sickness in a case that has sparked a public debate. She received new lungs on June 12 after a six-hour surgery that included resizing lungs from a grownup. "We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible. And an organ donor has made this possible for her," the family said in a statement. The parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. This month, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified. She has been in and out of hospitals her entire life, but her condition worsened this year. Her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected. In May, doctors told her mother, Janet Murnaghan, that Sarah had less than five weeks to live. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs "We knew at some point, she would need new lungs," her father, Fran Murnaghan, said in May. "We had hoped it would be much further down the road, but the disease has progressed." At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months. The Murnaghans were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day, since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region.	1
In the morning hours of April 21, 2010, Arleen Weise got a phone call from her son's friend, telling her that an explosion had ripped through the Gulf of Mexico oil rig where her 24-year-old had been working. The Texas native  had been trying to blow up a ruptured well, a risky operation that could have been stopped by better communication from crew members. According to Weise, she didn't know the rig had been sabotaged earlier that day."We have been looking into this for a very long time, and I have been assured by the very very very very important people at the State Department that the US government is being honest and telling the truth in everything that we're doing," Weise told Business Insider. "We don't know that our son's life has been sacrificed because of lies."It took nearly a year for Weise's story to be told, as the White House put her on a fast track for a State Department post. The department's career section, an arm's-length entity that is the "department's ultimate post-employment gatekeeper," eventually agreed to her appointment, despite her lack of experience.In late January, as news broke about Arleen Weise's appointment, we asked the State Department for more information on why it had decided to send former first lady Hillary Clinton to work in its career section. (Note: The department did not respond to a request for comment.)"The selection process for career section positions is highly competitive," said a State Department spokesman, who said that career office staff members were chosen for their ability to "connect with the international community," a phrase that evokes a vague, undefinable notion of world peace. "The selection process for State Department career section positions is not easy, but it is rigorous."The State Department did not provide any evidence that Weise had been chosen for an appointment that would put her in charge of a region at odds with US interests, however, despite her lack of experience in the job.This raises questions about the process through which the White House and White House staff select candidates for positions within the State Department. On its website, the administration provides ample evidence of why career staff are often selected for positions that have little to do with foreign policy."There is a range of career options available in our career department. The department has a long history of hiring and training individuals	0
Katherine Valde is ready when a fellow student says "no thanks" to early voting because of the thrill of casting a ballot on Election Day. "Things come up, you can have an exam," says Valde, the president of the University of Iowa   Community Development Corporation. "So yes, I'll vote on my own time. I'm not waiting to vote."The election is not the first time Valde has used her personal skills to circumvent the political process. For the past 30 years, she has worked as a community organizer, lobbying state legislators to make it easier for people to register and cast absentee ballots. Valde, who describes herself as "a moderate Democrat," is a lifelong voter.In fact, Valde has become one of the most skilled at making it easy to vote by the time it's most convenient. For her efforts, she is known as a nonpartisan crusader dedicated to "making it easy" to vote.She gets votes at the county lineValde is an unusually skilled community organizer because of her willingness to take on the cause of voters who don't have the time or energy for traditional campaigning.According to a University of Iowa study of voting conducted in 2004, almost 30 percent of voters in Iowa who missed the opportunity to vote in federal elections still had their ballots mailed as long as a month before the election. Of those 30 percent, 15 percent went to the polls in Iowa for the first time and cast absentee ballots.That means that voters who waited until they could do more for themselves and their state by mailing an absentee ballot ended up, more often than not, missing a crucial vote in an important state election.Valde, who has traveled the state educating people about this voting gap, advocates that the election system be changed so that any voter can register and vote as they would without the hassle of sitting still for hours in the polling place -- unless, of course, they have a reason to avoid voting because they're away for the weekend or they are ill."I'm not saying, 'I'll vote today,'" says Valde, but "I want elections to be convenient."Valde has become one of the most skilled community organizers in Iowa in the last 30 years because she takes the cause of the disenfranchised personal. In the 2004 study, she was just one of five community organizers in Iowa advocating for voting reform and in the	0
For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II. Actually, the choice was made for him in 1933, when he was just a child. Born in Germany, Tugend lived  in Poland, and came under the influence of the Communist Party. He was inspired to be a soldier, and joined the German Army, serving with the 5th Grenadier General Staff. With Communism dead, he took up arms again for Britain, and became a soldier in the British Army.After the war, Tugend went to work as chief of staff to a politician and politician's son, who founded a private security company. He served there for 14 years, then returned to the British Army as a lieutenant colonel, which is how he met his current wife, Elspeth, when she was a lieutenant, in the 1980s. In the early 90s, Tom Tugend became an adviser to the current British Prime Minister, and, in 1998, he was sworn in as High Commissioner to Canada. He is today the oldest High Commissioner in Canada.Tugend is a man with a mission: to "make a positive impact on the lives of Canadians today. What exactly is his mission? To make it clear that Canada is not a country waiting for its children to grow up and to make a positive impact on the lives of Canadians today."Tugend's mandate begins in his home country of England, where he hopes to inspire the British people to take action to address the issues facing their society."In England, there are too many children who have been deprived of proper care and affection. They don't get the right education, and they don't get the right nutrition, and they don't get the proper social environment. They're neglected. They are not getting any support from the state. When you see the numbers of children like that, and their parents are not taking any action, then you know that something is wrong. And so you have to take some action to get the system working the way it should be."When he was first appointed, Tugend, a former British soldier who now works for the Queen in Canada, stressed that he was there to make a positive impact."I am here to make a positive impact on the lives of some young people in Britain, because you cannot give hope and promise to a	0
Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident. "One of the  officers told me, 'You know, I can see how people would think that you're doing something illegal,' " said Santana, who was on the scene of a shooting in which a S.C. Department of Corrections officer shot and killed Walter L. Scott. "I said, 'Well that may be, but if I'm doing anything illegal I would have taken my video camera,' " he said.A video of the incident released by the SC Department of Corrections showed Walter Scott walking on the shoulder of I-95 with his girlfriend when one officer suddenly and deliberately struck Scott with a flashlight, which sent him to the ground in an apparent attempt to stop him. The officers moved Scott off the road and toward a wall where they tried to handcuff him before another officer stepped on Scott's back to try to render him unconscious with a Taser. Scott continued to struggle. When the Taser didn't work, the officers ordered him onto the ground. "We're not going to do that," one officer told him. "We're going to keep you on the ground so we can handcuff you."Santana said the officer was one of two who stepped onto Scott's back. He said he saw the incident on his cell phone. "I was able to capture that on video," he said. Santana said he was going to go back to his house and bring the video with him, although it would likely be deleted. "I'm going to bring it with me and I'm just hoping it's not deleted," he said, adding "I'm not concerned with what they do to me."It's unclear if the officer who made the decision to stop using Santana's phone will face any consequences. And it's unclear whether Scott's death will be the result of his own actions, or if the officer killed him for reasons that will be determined in the ongoing investigation.On August 28, 2013, while walking with his girlfriend in Columbia, South Carolina, Walter Scott attempted to cross a median on a highway. The officers who stopped Scott were apparently on routine patrol when they responded to reports of erratic driving in the area. The officer was apparently unaware that Scott was not the driver of the car he	0
A second person who had been taken hostage at a rural Louisiana bank this week has died, a hospital official said Thursday. Laden McDaniel, a woman who police said was among three Tensas State Bank  employees who went to the bank Thursday, died Thursday in hospital, hospital executive director Paul Copleman said. "We are heartbroken by the loss of Laden McDaniel, and our thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones," bank president and CEO Richard D. Mudd told The Associated Press.The Federal Reserve, in its latest policy statement on Wednesday, said the U.S. economy is growing at its fastest pace on record. The rate of growth is the greatest since the end of the Great Depression, the Fed said. The new report comes just weeks after the the central bank cut its target for the overnight rate, which influences how much mortgage loans are affordable to borrowers, from 4.25 percent to 4.25 percent. This is a big move as low interest rates are historically seen as a good sign for the economy.The U.S. housing market continued to recover in January, despite a decline in mortgage rates to a six-year low, according to a survey released Thursday by mortgage insurer CMHC. Nationwide home sales increased 2.3 percent from the previous month, its largest increase for January since 2007. The average sales price for a home sold last month ($266,077) was the highest for the month since 2007.There are still people in need of help. I asked myself what I could do and I realized that I have to do something. I need to help people. That moment changed my life, and made me realize that there are so many people in need of help.

It's the business buzzword that's helping to change the global economy: Start-up. But in Berlin, the start-up world is still shaping up. Simon Schaefer is the founder of Factory, a 16,000-square-meter  industrial and research park in the former Reichshoffen site on the northern outskirts of Berlin. Schaefer started Factory in 2013, and is just over a year into a grand plan for Berlin: to transform a former munitions factory and factory for chemical and mechanical companies into a new headquarters for start-ups and businesses.After visiting Factory with the German-based business magazine SmartMoney this week, Schaefer sat with WIRED to discuss the state of start-ups in Berlin and what's next for startups in Germany. A bit about the Berlin start-up scene: About a third of German start-ups are based in Berlin. The capital has the biggest start-up population in the country. There's a lot of infrastructure in place for startups, including a legal framework and a national investment fund to encourage investment in startups. It's also a city with a strong culture of innovation and entrepreneurs. But there are some major challenges facing startups in Berlin. There's a lot to learn, and Berlin is still developing its startup scene. In the meantime, Schaefer has his sights set on taking Factory from an abandoned factory to a thriving hub of innovation.WIRED: Berlin is one of Germany's most vibrant cities, and it's been a home to a lot of the country's digital pioneers, from Apple to Daimler. But Berlin has had a rough go at it with its economy, with a significant portion of its economy based on exports. So how has Berlin developed as a tech center over the past few years?Simon Schaefer: We’ve had an explosion of startup activity, but the capital has not been able to keep pace with the need. There are all of these startups in Berlin now, of course, but when they’re starting out or finding themselves they can’t do it on their own. That’s why I think Berlin’s been able to attract these companies. Berlin’s location is ideal. It’s an international hub and it has a very vibrant and diverse startup scene already. There are a lot of startups in Silicon Valley because of the location, but in Berlin they’re being drawn here by the cost of living	0
Erykah Badu shed her clothes as she walked along a Dallas, Texas, sidewalk until she was nude and then fell near where President Kennedy was assassinated. The result was a controversial video, released Saturday, for her song "Window Seat," which Badu said was "shot guerrilla style" with no crew and in one take March 17. Children could be seen nearby as Badu stripped in Dealey Plaza, a popular tourist spot since Kennedy's 1963 assassination. The singer's management did not immediately respond to request for comment, but Badu responded to the controversy via Twitter. She tweeted that "there were children there. i prayed they wouldnt b traumatized." Badu will not face indecent exposure charges for shedding her clothes on the Dallas, Texas, sidewalk, a Dallas Police spokeswoman said. Although children were nearby, no one filed a complaint against Badu after the March 17 incident, Dallas Police Senior Cpl. Janice Crowther said. "But if we had had a call and would have caught Ms. Badu in the act of walking down the street taking her clothes off, she would have been charge with a Class B misdemeanor," she said. The R&B singer said she was making a statement against "groupthink," which she tweeted was an "unwritten rule" that "i will not express my true opinion if it opposes those i love and fear." Some fans sent tweets praising Badu's artistic vision. One fan tweeted to Badu on Sunday: "thank you, because your being brave, i no longer feel afraid to say what i really feel." The video opens with a November 22, 1963, radio broadcast describing Kennedy's motorcade turning onto Elm Street seconds before fatal shots were fired. In the video, Badu is behind the wheel of a 1965 Lincoln Continental, parked along Kennedy's route. A single camera focuses on her as she walks toward Elm Street and the book depository where Kennedy's assassin fired his rifle. Badu tweeted that "i was petrified while shooting this video ... but liberation began to set in. i conquered many fears in that few moments." She said she was "too busy lookin for cops" to be embarrassed by her nudity. "i been naked all along in my words actions and deeds. thats the real vulnerable place," she tweeted.	1
The president of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated Monday morning, a day after an explosion killed the head of the West African country's military, the prime minister said. Circumstances of Joao Bernardo Vieira's death are unclear. It Â¿ was not terrorism, the BBC's Peter Biles in Libreville says."We only believe that it was a security situation, to prevent the possibility of reprisals," said Leopoldo Beletim, the spokesman for Guinea Bissau, the country's biggest in Africa and the largest ex-colony of Portugal. Joao Bernardo Vieira, 65, was the head of the army, prime minister and intelligence services and played an important role in the country's government. He was also the commander of Guinea's ground-attack aircraft, which were used for the attack. Viereira was killed as he drove to work Monday morning, Leopoldo Beletim said, adding he was not at home to his family and immediate family. It was unclear whether the prime minister's driver was also killed.President Joao Goulart of Brazil said Tuesday that the country would do everything in its power to find out the identity of the man who tried to assassinate him last week. Goulart said in a television interview that his death was not an accident. The 65-year-old was walking by himself when a man drove by and shot at him in front of television cameras Feb. 26 while he was leaving a downtown cafe near the headquarters of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT). Authorities told reporters that the man, who was arrested near the scene, had confessed to the crime. "There is no doubt that the crime was the work of a person with a specific intent to kill me," Goulart said Tuesday. He called the crime "an act of cowardly terrorism." Goulart left Brazil on Feb. 27 for a two-week holiday and was scheduled to return on March 3 to begin a new term as president. When he returns to Brazil, the country's leaders will convene a special session of Congress to name a successor to the president after the election, scheduled for June. Brazil's president is chosen by Congress. PT leaders, however, have not confirmed whether Goulart will seek a new term as president. "We are conducting a thorough investigation into the events last Monday," PT President Fernando Collor said in a televised speech Wednesday on national television.	0
The puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week. Sheldon Stephens, now 24, is the fourth man to sue Kevin Clash, but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen. Stephens' lawsuit is "meritless and barred by the statute of limitations," Clash lawyer Michael Berger told CNN Tuesday. "Mr. Clash continues to deny any wrongdoing, and we intend to defend this case forcefully." Although Stephens called it an "an adult consensual relationship" last November, the revelation triggered Clash's suspension from Sesame Street and eventually his resignation. Clash, who provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo since 1984, acknowledged a relationship between "two consenting adults" when Stephens' story first emerged, but he said it otherwise was a "false and defamatory allegation." "I am a gay man," Clash, 52, said in a statement in November. "I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter." When heroes disappoint our kids Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed last November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them. They are all represented by Florida lawyer Jeff Herman, who also filed Stephens' lawsuit Monday. Clash's lawyer has asked a judge to dismiss the three other suits based on his argument that the men waited too long to sue. The federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years, while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago, Berger said in a court filing this month. Each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with Clash. "Clash was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers, while at the same time he was, in secret, preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests," the Stephens suit alleged. While the allegations in the newest suit mirror what the other men contend, Stephens' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by Clash.	1
For thousands of years, China has seen itself as the Middle Kingdom, the center of the universe -- a view that shapes China's understanding of the world and contributes to an indifferent attitude toward other countries. The world may be watching   and listening, but for China, it's not on their terms.Travelling around the world has long been a dream of Chinese tourists and of Chinese workers, the world's largest expatriate population. It is a dream that has remained largely unrealized because of a long-standing belief that China's only real rival is China itself, and that the only way to truly compete is through hard work.With many global challenges still unresolved and no country as powerful as China that can solve the problems facing the world, China should take responsibility for its actions.The best way to become a global player is to recognize that countries have internal problems. China should become a source of ideas, people and technology, not just a competitor.China can help other countries develop economically and politically. With its vast wealth, China has the resources to offer a range of services and good ideas.China might even offer more than the best ideas, and that would benefit everyone. For example, China's technological advances in the last several decades have made possible the Internet and a host of other services that would otherwise be unimagined.Some of our technologies may also give rise to some new challenges. For example, China's ability to provide cheap loans to developing countries is a threat to existing Western-style lending. China's influence is growing within the international community, and its companies seek to take advantage of such influence. It is in this area that China's growing power has the potential to benefit all countries.China's goal would be to expand the global community of nations, not just its own region. While China's goal is to be prosperous and to rule over large parts of the world, the aim must be that the world can benefit from China's growth.China's economic expansion has long been hampered by a lack of infrastructure and a poor system of land and water management. The cost of running an airplane is relatively high because of limited energy supplies, air pollution, environmental damage and air-traffic congestion. The cost of running a coal-fired power plant is high because of the energy demand.These problems have not deterred Chinese immigrants who have come to the United States and Europe	0
that he secretly helped Israel develop its nuclear weapons program. Milchan, who has produced dozens of major movies and worked with the biggest stars, worked for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations, he told Israeli television's Uvda "Fact 14" show. A 2011 book detailed Milchan's secret work, but until now he has not talked openly about his life of espionage. Milchan, whose films include "Fight Club," "Pretty Woman," and "L.A. Confidential," set up and operated dozens of companies that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s, he said. "I did it for my country and I'm proud of it," Milchan told interviewer Ilana Dayan in a report aired this week. His spy work was a rumor in the 1980s when Milchan was producing movies, including "The King of Comedy" and "Once Upon a Time in America" with actor Robert De Niro. De Niro sat with Milchan for an interview with Dayan for the show.  He said he suspected something about the producer's "ventures" decades ago, but "I wasn't sure." He didn't question his producer about the rumors because "it wasn't my business," he said.  "He didn't ask me certain things and I don't ask him. " Milchan: 'Wow! The action! That was exciting' Milchan -- born in 1944 in what was then Palestine -- was a successful young businessman in the United States when his friend Shimon Peres -- who later became Israel's prime minister -- recruited him to help after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Uvda report said. Israeli spy officials used bank accounts set up by Milchan to make weapons-related purchases around the world, including helicopters and missiles, the report said. "Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond?  Wow!  The action!  That was exciting," Milchan told Dayan. Milchan told how he convinced a German engineer to let him photograph plans for a nuclear facility. When the FBI discovered one of his companies was used to ship nuclear triggers to Israel without proper licenses, it resulted in the 1985 indictment of an executive who was involved.  Charges against Milchan were dropped by the Reagan administration.	1
Police are on an "intense" and "extremely focused" nationwide manhunt for the occupants of a black Range Rover at the center of a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that claimed three lives. The incident involved a Maserati that was shot at and subsequently crashed into a taxi, which caught fire. The driver of the Maserati, whom family identified as Kenneth Cherry Jr., died at a hospital. The taxi driver and a passenger also died. The shots were fired from the Range Rover, which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere. Police have received multiple reports of vehicles that match the description, but "at this point, we have no information that the vehicle in the crime has been located," he said Friday. Cassell declined to say whether there was one suspect or several, citing the ongoing investigation. Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati on Thursday when someone in the Range Rover fired several shots at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, CNN affiliate KVVU said. "It is gut-wrenching," Boldon's younger brother, Tehran Boldon, tearfully told KVVU. "My life mission will be to see them punished and brought to justice for the senseless thing they did." In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire -- not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father. "He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo (Road)" because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino, Tehran Boldon said. "He called and he didn't get a response. So his father was the fatality in that accident that he was being warned to avoid. "We lost a real patriarch and brother," said Tehran Boldon. The son, 36, works the same shift as his father did. The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said. He is also trying to provide the coroner's office with his brother's dental records, he said.	1
Even when Chelsea held a nine-point lead over Manchester City atop English football's Premier League, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho always maintained his team wasn't the favorite. He is being proved right -- with Saturday not helping the Blues. Chelsea suffered a shock 1-0 loss at relegation threatened Crystal Palace and hours later saw Manchester City gain a point thanks to a 1-1 draw at Arsenal. It might have been worse for Chelsea, since City led 1-0. "I think it is now impossible to win the title," Mourinho told Sky Sports before the Manchester City game. "We depend too much on other results." Chelsea still leads the standings by a point over Liverpool and two over City but City has two games in hand and Liverpool will go top if it earns a point Sunday at home against Tottenham. Manchester City, fresh off a convincing victory in the Manchester derby, took a deserved lead in London in the 18th minute when David Silva was the quickest to react after Edin Dzeko's left-footed shot struck the post. Arsenal appeared listless, perhaps the result of losing 6-0 at Chelsea last week and then dropping more points against Swansea. But the Gunners were a different side in the second half, leveling through defensive midfielder Mathieu Flamini in the 53rd. And Arsenal almost took the lead, Joe Hart stopping Lukas Podolski with City creaking. In the end City seemed happy to take a point judging by manager Manuel Pellegrini's substitutions. "We played better in the first half," Pellegrini told Sky Sports. Although Chelsea tallied more than 20 shots, only two were on goal and none managed to beat keeper Julian Speroni. Speroni twice thwarted Chelsea's offensive star, Eden Hazard. John Terry, so solid for Chelsea this season, gave Palace a valuable three points with an own goal in the 52nd minute. Mourinho didn't blame Terry and in fact praised his four main defenders as a whole. However, he added: "You have other players who are fantastic in some matches and disappear in other matches." Manchester United has struggled in its first season under David Moyes but there were boos when a banner flew above Old Trafford calling for the Scot's departure.	1
The number of Tibetans in China who have set themselves on fire to protest Beijing's rule has reached 100, according to Tibetan advocacy groups. Lobsang Namgyal, a 37-year-old former monk, set himself on fire earlier this month  at the end of the Dalai Lama's annual exile visit to China.His message was clear: if the Dalai Lama was allowed to return, Tibet would be free. His act of self-immolation has been seen by many as a turning point in the spiritual and political struggle between Tibetans and China, which has maintained control over the Himalayan nation since its independence in 1950.While many Tibetans in exile have made gestures of solidarity, none have expressed any public support for the self-immolator.Although there has not been any official response, Tibetans in exile are planning to hold a demonstration at Parliament House in London on November 26 to protest against the self-immolator.The Dalai Lama has been allowed to enter China on a limited visit to attend three events at Beijing's Great Hall of the People. The visit marked the first official contact between him and Chinese authorities in 22 years.The Dalai Lama was not present during the meeting of the 14th National People's Congress, the highest decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party, held Friday and Saturday.The Dalai Lama, who has called the meetings a "meaningless farce" and accused the Chinese government of "treating the Great Seal of the People's Republic... as a mere decoration," had promised not to appear at the meetings by bringing his followers. The meetings were postponed indefinitely in the wake of China's "one country, two systems" policy and the Dalai Lama's visit to Tibet."We will definitely hold a big demonstration in London on November 26 to protest against the arrest and detention of the Dalai Lama and China's violation of democratic rights and rule of law," one of the organizers of the protest, the Tibetan Political Council, told RFA in an interview on Friday."The meeting was arranged for a while back, but our demand was not met. The Chinese government said the meeting needs to be postponed," he said.Chinese authorities have said the Dalai Lama will not be detained because he has the "right to meet" with the visiting officials. The Dalai Lama's followers have long demanded the meeting to	0
A judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for Dr. Conrad Murray, charged in Michael Jackson's death, until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses won't be available until then. The hearing, in which prosecutors will try to convince the judge there is probable cause to hold a trial, was expected to start in October. Murray sat silently in front of the judge at Monday's court appearance, while Jackson's elderly parents watched from the second row. Judge Michael Pastor said he "wanted to expedite" the case, but he understands it will take more time for each side to prepare. The preliminary hearing, which is estimated to take two or three weeks, is now scheduled to start on January 4, Pastor said. Dozens of Michael Jackson fans, angry about the pop star's death, gathered outside the courthouse Monday. A handful of them were allowed inside to witness the proceedings. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while the singer rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admitted giving him propofol as a sleep aid. But Murray's lawyer said the amount was much smaller than what was found in Jackson's body during the autopsy. "The fact [of the way] that he died was a mystery a year ago, and still is," Houston attorney Ed Chernoff told CNN in an exclusive interview recently. Members of Jackson's family have attended each hearing since Murray's arrest in February. When brother Jermaine Jackson left the last hearing in June, he indicated some of them were not satisfied with the case against Murray. "Dr. Murray's the fall guy," Jermaine Jackson said after the hearing. "This is bulls--t." California authorities announced last month that seven other doctors and a nurse who treated Jackson will not face criminal prosecution in connection with the singer's death. Pastor denied a request by the state medical board to order Murray to stop practicing medicine as a condition of his bond while he awaits trial.  His lawyer said he has no California patients, although he continues to treat patients in Nevada and Texas. Jackson fans have organized protests at each hearing, taunting Murray as he enters and departs the courthouse.	1
Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman. The comedian confirmed the Judd Apatow-produced film was moving forward during an ursine rant on Twitter on Wednesday, but only if he received a new Pee-wee Herman movie on the budget scale of Back to the Future Part III. Reubens tweeted it out and then deleted the tweet, but the hashtag #Pee-weeHerman was still up. Reubens said more on the movie to come."The only way I would say that is if they'd pay me like a major studio would, not like I'm doing it on a shoestring," Reubens said. The Apatow-produced Will and Grace and Step Brothers movies were made on small budgets, but Reubens' Pee-wee Herman was made for $250,000 and grossed $13 million domestically and eventually $75 million worldwide.The only way Reubens' new Pee-wee Herman movie could make it work is if it was profitable and made a profit. So far, no one has asked him, and he's not planning on working with a Hollywood studio on this. It's a small indie film that he created with his two daughters and his son-in-law. "I just told them they can do whatever they want to do with it, and they said they're going to make it this year," Reubens said. The movie has a release date set for May 29, 2019.According to Reubens, he and Apatow have been talking about a Pee-wee Herman movie for decades."For so many years, there have been conversations between Judd Apatow and myself about putting the character on screen," Reubens said. "It would be a dream to revisit Pee-wee Herman the same way we revisited Beetlejuice."Pee-wee had a resurgence at Apatow's Apatow-produced Will & Grace and Step Brothers movies. For his reemergence, he was featured as the narrator at the Will & Grace premiere, and Apatow appeared at his step-brothers' Golden Globes awards shows. The success of Pee-wee's movie was a key factor in the success of the Will &	0
The world's tropical forests are disappearing, and one reason is simple economics: People, companies and governments earn more by logging, mining or farming places such as the Amazon jungle than by conserving them. Global climate change treaty, scheduled for completion in  late  2020, is unlikely to achieve the required cuts in emissions by then.The challenge is to save forests while not destroying them. That sounds simple, except that forests are not one uniform thing. There's more of the western United States, for instance, because it's cooler in summer, and more of the boreal zone, which is much colder than the Amazon, because it is drier.The problem is that the two things are interconnected: if, for example, the boreal grows warmer, the tropical dries out in dry years. That in turn lowers the potential for precipitation in the tropics.That explains the current boom in carbon farming in the western United States, and the current boom in deforestation and carbon farming in the Amazon. The latter is due to the new agricultural biofuels industry, which has been in operation for only a few years, and is still a work-in-process.The point is that, whatever you do, some of it will be wrong. It is better to be on the right side of the world's second most important problem.In March, for example, the World Wildlife Fund launched the Carbon Farming Collaborative, in which it is asking about 20 businesses, including four from North America that are planning to add new carbon and biofuels technologies to their products.It is a way for them to say whether there could be new markets, to gauge public reaction and perhaps to get a slice of the carbon and biofuel market that they will want if carbon farming becomes a commercial reality.The Carbon Farming Collaborative has been supported by the Carbon Farming Industry Association, which has been in the United States for about a decade. It is run by Peter Gleick, who has been at the forefront of carbon farming research. Carbon Farming Institute, which is named after his son and is run by his daughter, offers free courses on biofuels, bioenergy, carbon farming and climate change to businesses and individuals.The project will be a challenge for several reasons. It will require cooperation from a lot of different industries.Also, it has a potentially broad economic impact, because many of the industries it touches	0
A plane crashed Tuesday in western Kenya, killing all four people on board, including a Cabinet minister and an assistant minister, President Mwai Kibaki said. The two senior government figures were members of Raila Odinga's party. "The wreckage has been found and there are no survivors," Kibaki said, according to the government Web site. Kenyan Roads Minister Kipkalya Kones and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho, in the Rift Valley. The plane crashed in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya, Kibaki said. The president identified the two others killed as Kenneth Kiprono Bett, who worked for Kones, and the pilot. "Our country has lost leaders of immense potential at their prime age and with a promising future," Kibaki said. "Let us all remain united at this moment of sorrow as a nation." Salim Lone, a government spokesman, told CNN earlier that the plane crashed about an hour after it took off from Nairobi's Wilson Airport around 2:18 p.m. local time (7:18 a.m. ET). "This is terrible, and utterly unimaginable news for us in Kenya, where there has been so much suffering recently," Lone said. He did not know what caused the crash, but said, "There is absolutely no hint of foul play. It looks like a terrible tragedy." Both Kones and Laboso belonged to the Orange Democratic Movement party (ODM), which joined Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) in a coalition government earlier this year under an United Nations-brokered agreement that brought an end to the violence that ripped the nation after Kibaki's disputed re-election in late December. More than 1,000 people were killed and 350,000 were displaced in the violence, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Under the agreement, Kibaki retained the presidency while ODM leader Raila Odinga became prime minister. A new cabinet took office in April, with equal representation from both ODM and PNU. The officials' deaths came a day before parliamentary by-elections in five districts in Kenya.	1
The first search of Michael Jackson's bedroom a day after his death found marijuana, skin-bleaching and hair-growing ointments, anti-insomnia pills and empty bottles of several anti-anxiety drugs, according to court documents unsealed Thursday. The documents reveal what investigators found in Jackson's bedroom the day after his death. A substance initially suspected to be tar heroin proved not to be a narcotic, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. An affidavit, written by Los Angeles Detective Orlando Martinez, was used to outline probable cause for a warrant to search Jackson's Holmby Hills, California, home on June 26. Martinez filed his report on what was found in the search five days later. While the documents may provide some insight into Jackson's life, they appeared to contain nothing that would lend new insight into his death. Another sworn statement written by Martinez several weeks later -- and made public earlier this week -- provided a more extensive list of drugs found by investigators at Jackson's bedside. That document also revealed that toxicology tests led the Los Angeles County coroner to a preliminary conclusion that Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, a powerful sedative he had been given to help him sleep. The latest release refers to suspicions by some members of Jackson's family in the hours after his June 25 death that heroin might have been involved. "During the course of the investigation, family members of the decedent notified [coroner investigator] Chief [Ed] Winter that they located a quantity of tar heroin in a bag in the decedent's bedroom located on the second floor of the residence," Martinez wrote. He used this statement to justify a search of Jackson's home because "there may be additional medications and/or narcotics at the location as well as the necessity to confiscate these items for the safety of the minor children." A source with knowledge of the probe told CNN Thursday that a test later showed that a brown, sticky substance found in the search was not heroin. The source asked not to be named because the source was not authorized to speak about it publicly. In addition to listing two Baggies of marijuana, the detective's report of what was found in Jackson's home listed three vials of Latanoprost Plus Solution liquid. An online search found medical journal references to this glaucoma medication also used to stimulate hair growth.	1
The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings has cited the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as motivating factors behind last week's attack, a U.S. government official said Tuesday. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been able to speak, listen to the radio and walk around freely since he was taken ill. "He's able to communicate with us today," said U.S. government official Dean Boyd. It doesn't appear he's regained consciousness yet. "We are still trying to get him to a place where he can talk," Boyd said. Boyd said U.S. officials are hoping that the suspect's brain waves would be detected in the near future. A government official who attended the briefing on the bombing suspect said it is clear that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not on a suicide mission. "He is not suicidal or homicidal," the official said. 'A radicalized zealot' The official said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was an "irrational, radicalized fundamentalist Muslim" who was radicalized by his radical views of U.S. foreign policy and by Islamist websites that he read online. "He was a follower of violent jihad, a jihadist," the official said. "He saw the U.S. as a colonial power, an occupier. He saw his actions as a response to the occupation of his own country."In an interview with "CBS This Morning" on Monday, Dzhokhar's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said that her son's mental issues began when he was a university student. She said that he suffered from depression and obsessive tendencies. "He was very emotional," she said. "They started sending him to therapy [after he was 18 years old]." She said that her son was on medication but sometimes took it alone. "He didn't want to take it alone," she said. "He would do it by himself. He would sit in his room and cry out. It's very difficult for my family to be here." But she said she hoped by the time he was 20 years old, he would have found peace and happiness. When Dzhokhar attended the University of Massachusetts, the school offered him counseling for his emotional problems. "That was a good start," she said. "I would like him to go to university." Dzhokhar graduated from college in 2011. In the same year, his brother Seiran was killed in a stabbing attack by	0
For nearly two weeks, I was a failure -- a complete and utter failure. Ever since October 1, when Healthcare.gov went live, I've tried to go on the site and enroll. I don't need health insurance -- I get it from my employer -- but I wanted to see how easy (or difficult) it is for the millions of Americans who do need insurance and want to shop on the new exchanges set up by Obamacare. For about a week, I couldn't even create a login and password, the necessary first step for shopping. Then finally I could, but when I tried to log in, I received error messages; sometimes I even saw the dreaded twirly thing that just went 'round and 'round. When I tried to make a new account, that didn't work either. I called the Healthcare.gov 1-800-number for help, and the representatives said the site was very busy. They suggested I try at off-peak hours, such as early in the morning or late at night. Following their advice, I made attempts at 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. Still no luck. Apparently those hours weren't off-peak enough, so on Saturday night I kissed my husband and daughters good night and set my alarm for 3 a.m. for a date with Healthcare.gov. But in the wee hours of Sunday morning, I was to meet with only more disappointment. "The system is down at the moment," read the message on the screen. "We're currently making system improvements. Please try again later." I tried to go back to sleep but couldn't. I've covered health care reform for 25 years, first as a print reporter in Washington and then for CNN. I interviewed Sen. Claude Pepper about catastrophic coverage in the late 1980s, reported on Hillary Clinton's health care plan in the 1990s and have followed every twist and turn of the health care reform debate since 2009. Over the years I've watched countless people suffer because they couldn't get insurance. In my Empowered Patient column I've tried to help the uninsured muddle through by explaining how to negotiate hospital fees or get help paying for prescription drugs, for example. But I knew my words were Band-Aids -- flimsy, torn Band-Aids without much sticky stuff, at best.	1
For decades, U.S. climate change policy amounted to a hypocrisy associated with bad parenting: "Do as I say, not as I do." That began to change Monday when President Barack Obama's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce  greenhouse gases -- the first formal commitment to climate action by any nation in over two decades. In a speech before the nation's governors, Obama pledged to phase out fossil fuel production, establish a nationwide cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, and make it easier for businesses to offset their greenhouse gas emissions."While some continue to deny science -- denying that human activity is driving changes in Earth's climate -- I refuse to. I believe the science. I believe that if left in its current state, the United States is set to miss its own temperature goals for 2050 -- to miss even the goals we need to hit to save people from the impacts of global warming."While some continue to deny science -- denying that human activity is driving changes in Earth's climate -- I refuse to. I believe the science. I believe that if left in its current state, the United States is set to miss its own temperature goals for 2050 -- to miss even the goals we need to hit to save people from the impacts of global warming. I know that as a species, we are only going to continue to adapt to the dangers of climate change, and that what we do now will affect the environment and our global climate for centuries to come. That's hardwired into my DNA.Obama's administration released its energy and climate plan Monday, the day after the president signed into law a $3.7 billion aid package to help the country cope with the impacts of climate change. The plan includes a suite of policies that are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from a range of fuels, from coal-to-liquid energy to renewables like wind and solar. Obama's plan requires coal, oil, and gas companies to develop plans to reduce their carbon emissions, something the president pledged to do as a candidate in his 2012 re-election bid. Obama has made combating climate change a top priority of his administration, in part by calling climate change "the defining challenge of our time." "And I need your help to make sure that we don't slip back to the ways things were before."As I write this, it is my job to tell you about a plan designed to fight climate change -- and to do it in a	0
The defense for Charles Taylor is expected to submit its counter-recommendation Thursday after prosecutors said the former Liberian president deserves an 80-year sentence for a war crimes conviction. Taylor was found guilty last month of aiding and abetting war crimes, rape, and murder in Sierra Leone.The defense must also respond to a new motion filed by Taylor’s lawyers, detailing why Judge David Haag should not sentence the former president to a mandatory life sentence in prison.Taylor is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 27.At oral argument on June 16, Solicitor General William Conley urged the court to reject Taylor’s motion.“If this court orders a sentence of imprisonment for this defendant, it will be a sentence of life,” Conley told the court. “This record does not suggest so.”The defense is scheduled to file another response to Haag’s sentencing recommendations late this week.“We will respond to the court’s sentencing recommendations,” a defense source said. “The next phase will be a response.”The government, in its new motion, alleges Taylor killed thousands of people in Sierra Leone during the civil war from 1991 to 2002. He also committed atrocities to control the population in Liberia.Sierra Leonean government officials estimate the number of deaths to be between 4,900 and 16,000. Taylor’s defense says that figure is an over-estimate.The new motion also asks Haag to reject Taylor’s claim that the president doesn’t deserve a life sentence, because he can be tried again and convicted of a lesser amount of charges.Taylor’s lawyers also ask the court not to follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who was found guilty of crimes related to the government’s handling of a drug-interdiction program.Taylor is also challenging the constitutionality of the prosecution. That challenge will continue to trial.Taylor was charged as a Liberian national, but is being tried for the crimes he committed in Sierra Leone, where he served as president from 1967-2002.He was convicted as a “foreign terrorist,” which was a criminal classification at the time that was later declared unconstitutional by	0
At least 10 people died in three separate attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, including an service member for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to Afghan government and ISAF officials. Two Americans were among those wounded in an attack, an Afghan official said. A roadside bomb killed nine Afghan civilians and wounded five more in the Paghman district, west of Kabul, according to a statement from Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office. Karzai condemned the "terrorists" for the killings "during the holy month of Ramadan." In a separate incident in eastern Afghanistan, an ISAF service member died from "direct fire" during an insurgent attack, ISAF said. In a third attack, a suicide bomber in a truck detonated near an ISAF military base, wounding at least 13 people in Logar province, just south of Kabul, provincial spokesman Mohammad Faqeer Darwish said. He said that two of the injured were Americans. ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Hagen Messer confirmed that ISAF service members were injured in the explosion in the province's capital of Pul-e-Alam, but did not identify their nationalities nor say how many had been hurt.

In the "Incredible Burt Wonderstone," Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play world-famous Las Vegas magicians. Carell wears spangled red velvet and a poufy wig that makes him look like Barry  Williams—who, in turn, looks like a cross between a gay Tony Curtis and a tony Dick Van Dyke. Buscemi, in a black suit and shirt, is always clean-cut and sober, which makes for some pretty funny moments. But after the third time Carell throws a punch at him, Buscemi gets up on a chair and tells him he is better off not fighting him anymore. The joke is on Carell here: Buscemi's a big enough man to beat him up. He might look like a gay-appeal icon, but Carell is the real thing. He has enough street smarts to know when he needs to settle things with violence and when it would be better to talk things out. The real thing is the person who never talks to you unless you have a gun to your head, who will cut you up, and who will take you to jail.#  _**The Amazing Spider-Man**_ **(2007- )****AMERICAN CULTURAL** **THEATRICAL** **COMEDY**This is the movie that you really don't understand what a joke is until you haven't laughed at one in quite a while.In some respects it is good—it has a strong and funny script, a hilarious cast of supporting players, a good mix of styles, and a few surprisingly dark but necessary moments. It's also just a little too muddled and messy, with the hero of the hour too often a victim of his own cleverness and the villain too often the unwitting culprit. But if you take it as a whole, and you give it a chance to breathe, it is a lot of fun.Director Sam Raimi ( _Batman Begins_ ) doesn't pull punches, and even in the moments when Raimi seems to step up the pace, he still understands the comedy in Spider-Man's web-swinging. There's even a happy middle ground here, in the form of the good guys, both sides of the law, and the villains.The real surprise at the heart of this movie is how genuinely funny Raimi is and how	0
The federal shutdown is about to hit those who keep an eye on the nation's 100 commercial nuclear power plants. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Monday it expects to furlough some 3,600 employees at the close of business on Â¬Â¦ ...The Energy Department said employees should get paid in time for a Thanksgiving holiday or in January after the shutdown is over. Department workers have been paid by an extra $2.23 an hour since Oct. 1, according to the Labor Department. The shutdown was triggered after the Senate and House of Representatives failed to reach a deal to extend government funding until next March.WASHINGTON (AP) â The top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee on Thursday offered his colleagues assurances that President Donald Trump will fully restore power to some 2,200 nuclear power plants in the United States â including Vermont Yankee, which is struggling to stay online â if the parties can reach an agreement in time for the government shutdown. While Trump had said he is willing to pay for the reactors, he has also suggested they may not be needed in the future.WASHINGTON (AP) â The administration of President Donald Trump is preparing to make a series of announcements about the nation's nuclear plants, including the planned closure of the Vermont Yankee reactor in New York, while Senate Republicans were working to make an agreement with Democrats to give $19.5 billion to the nuclear industry. Trump announced on Twitter that he has ordered DOE to review plans for the 2,200 commercial nuclear power plants across the country that can't now be restarted due to shortfalls in federal funding.WASHINGTON (AP) â President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the first significant government spending bill in months and laid out his budget priorities with a pledge to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year. Trump said his budget would ask voters to end the shutdown and send his administration a bill to rebuild the military but it also would pay for his proposed wall with Mexico, which he has said must be part of the final package.WASHINGTON (AP) â A federal judge ruled that House Republicans who defied their own leadership and refused to fund the government can sue the White House and several top Trump administration officials over the shutdown, a decision that could set off a constitutional showdown.

The pristine waters of the Seychelles, a glittering necklace of coralline and granitic islands scattered on the Indian Ocean, have long beguiled jet-setters and eco-conscious visitors from around the world, turning the idyllic archipelago   (www.seychelles.org)   into a popular stop for eco-adventurers and the curious. But over the past four years, these same waters have become a popular stop on the international drug trade run by smugglers, and the islands are increasingly under pressure from these illegal outfits -- who, under the radar, are also responsible for the destruction of pristine habitats   and the erosion of the reefs that many locals depend on for their livelihood."The Seychelles Drug War is as big as the Seychelles itself," says Paul D. Kibet, director of the Seychelles Environmental Protection Agency and founder of the Seychelles Environment Network (  seychelles.org) -- a network of environmental organizations that has been at the forefront of the campaign to confront the problem.Fighting the tradeThe major impact the illegal drug dealers are having on the Seychelles comes as a result of their constant efforts to thwart the Seychelles government's efforts at control, by smuggling into and out of the country, or by stealing or destroying environmental resources.The Seychelles is no exception to this. The drug trade is a key element in the overall Seychelles story, and has long been present. But it's also changing."Over the past 15 years our approach has been to tackle [the drug problem] one sector at a time," says Kibet. "For us, the drug trade is a very big part of our country, but it’s also changing, and it’s changing fast." According to Kibet, most drugs entering the Seychelles are brought in from Latin America and the Caribbean, and are being refined by the Chinese. A significant number of the drug seizures over the past decade have come from Seychelles-based smuggling organizations.The biggest drug busts the EPA has made have related to cannabis and heroin, but a number of drugs, including methamphetamine and cocaine, have also been found on the islands.The Seychelles Environmental Network, a network of environmental organizations that	0
By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world." Mother Teresa, pictured in 1997, lived and worked in Kolkata from 1931 until her death. That's how Mother Teresa chose to describe herself in life. In death, however, her words will probably do little to settle a diplomatic squabble over her remains. The Albanian government wants to receive her remains before her 100th birthday next year. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said his nation plans to open a museum in Mother Teresa's honor and has planned commemorative events. But more important, Berisha said, Mother Teresa should rest next to her mother and sister, who are buried in a cemetery in the Albanian capital, Tirana. "She missed them very much all her life," he said. "My request is a very human one. "She told me that she prayed every day for her family and her country. That's why I think both governments should talk about [this] and find a solution," Berisha said. Then there is Macedonia, the nation where Mother Teresa was born and raised. It, too, may stake a claim on the woman who is well on a path to sainthood. But India, the land where she made her life's work, has made it clear that Mother Teresa, buried in the heart of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), will not be leaving her final resting place. "Mother Teresa was a citizen of India," said Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the country's external affairs ministry. Though she arrived as a foreigner, Mother Teresa came to be cherished in her adopted home. In billboards and booklets, the city of Kolkata proudly claims her as one of its most famous citizens. She was a devout Catholic who transcended religion, inspiring a nation of millions of poor people, mostly Hindus and Muslims. She is buried in the courtyard at the nondescript Missionaries of Charity compound in central Kolkata, a site visited by residents and tourists alike. People stream in from the bustling streets to the serenity of Mother House to pay their respects -- and find strength in her presence. They wander among her order of nuns in their simple blue-bordered white cotton saris. On the second floor is the small and sparse room that belonged to Mother Teresa.	1
Legendary and now disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong told Oprah Winfrey during a confessional interview that he hopes to compete again. "If you're asking me do I want to compete again, the answer is hell yes. I'm a competitor," Armstrong said during the second part of a two-part interview, which aired Friday on Winfrey's OWN channel and online. "I can't lie to you. I'd love the opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm doing this. Frankly, this may not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it," he said. In part one of the interview, which aired Thursday, Armstrong admitted, unequivocally and for the first time, that he used performance-enhancing drugs on the way to seven Tour de France wins. When asked whether he felt disgraced, Armstrong said that he did. "But I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff," he said during the second part of the interview. Armstrong, who has been stripped of his Tour de France titles and an Olympic bronze medal, blamed no one but himself for his doping decisions, and was careful not to implicate others. 7 lessons Armstrong's confession has taught us "I deserve to be punished," Armstrong told Winfrey. But, he said: "I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty," comparing his punishment to the lesser punishments of other cyclists who doped. "I'm not saying that that's unfair necessarily, but I'm saying it's different," Armstrong said. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency hit Armstrong with a lifetime ban after the agency issued a 202-page report in October that said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program. Armstrong, in the first part of the interview, talked about the culture of cycling at the time he competed, telling Winfrey that doping was widespread then and just as much "part of the job" as water bottles and tire pumps. The former cyclist said he didn't view using banned drugs then as cheating. "I viewed it as a level playing field." The scandal has tarred the Livestrong cancer charity that Armstrong founded and brought an end to his endorsement deals. He described to Winfrey stepping down from that charity, which he characterized as his "sixth child." That moment, he said, was his most humbling.	1
The nurse in Texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from Ebola. She wore a mask, gown, shield and gloves. Her patient, a man who contracted the virus in Africa, was in isolation at the Dallas hospital where she worked. The nurse said she has not been notified about the case since the patient went to the hospital April 5.She said she is worried her family members will contract the disease because she has only been in contact with the doctor who treats him in the hospital.She said she worries that family members of the patient might have contact with anyone she may have in her contacts, and possibly with many people.The nurse said she's contacted her family doctor, the hospital's infection-control officer, three other health care workers and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said the CDC told her the chances are high that the patient had Ebola.She said she is trying to stay away from any contact with the patient."I know people are coming to my house," she said. "I'm in quarantine.""This is one of the most frightening things I have ever experienced," the nurse said."I've never seen anything like it," she said, adding she has not left the hospital since April 5."But I do not want to see or have any contact with my patient," she added. "And I've always been in this position.""I do not want my family to get it, either," she said.She said she fears that she might infect her family and her husband, who works in the same hospital."If you have a spouse or family member who is infected with Ebola, you're putting your loved ones and yourself at risk," she said."I do not want to put my husband in jeopardy," she said. "And I never have."The nurse also said she contacted the Texas Department of State Health Services, the city of Dallas, two state agencies -- the Texas Commission on Human Health and the Texas Department of Health -- and the Texas governor's office "to ask them to do whatever they can do to find out who he's infected with Ebola before anyone else gets it."She said the nurse is "very concerned" that her family member is infected with Ebola."If anything happens to me or my family, please don't take	0
Eight people were injured when a public bus crashed into a central Massachusetts home Monday evening, including a mother and her three children who were inside at the time. All were taken to the hospital for minor injuries, according to Chief Stephen Coleman of the Auburn Fire Department. Coleman told CNN that it took an hour and 15 minutes to free the driver, describing the extrication as "very lengthy and complicated." Lt. Richard Wolanski of the Massachusetts State Police said the home, which is at the intersection of two side streets, was "fully compromised." The cause of the crash is under investigation. In a bit of irony, the side of the bus that is visible from the street is emblazoned with a pitch for advertising opportunities that reads: "Drive Your Message Home with the Worcester Regional Transportation Authority."	1
The girl the Taliban wanted dead has not only survived but was able to walk out of the hospital last week. But other highly publicized, vicious attacks on women and girls have not had such triumphant outcomes. Malala  is back at school.It was on October 9, 2012, that Malala was shot in the head at point-blank range by Taliban gunmen while she was speaking to her class from her hospital bed in Pakistan. She spent nearly a week in intensive care. Her left eye was almost entirely destroyed and she lost her hearing.In fact, she has shown remarkable resilience. In the months that followed, she returned to school and went to live with her parents in Swat. Then was shot on a motorcycle while riding to a nearby market. She lost vision in one eye and the other eye is partially blind.For months, she waited for a Taliban leader to show his face and say he would see that Malala was dead. He did not come to her aide. Instead, the Taliban, apparently realizing she was not a victim, took the opportunity to kill her. Her father, a teacher and former president of Swat’s educational council, said at the time, “I never thought I would see my daughter in such an ugly state.” “Now I’m a very very sad father,” Mr. Malala said, according to AFP. “She was the light of my life.”At a news conference this week in Islamabad, Mr. Malala, her father and wife said she had now recovered vision in her left eye. Her father said he hoped “she will soon become a normal human being and join society.” Despite the trauma, Ms. Malala is now back at school.HARARE, Aug 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – A man has been jailed over the weekend for threatening a female teacher with “blows to the face and other sharp objects” a month before she was killed in a Taliban attack.Brigadier Shabir Ahmed, who was arrested on Saturday in Bulawayo, is the latest in a series of men who have threatened women teachers, saying they should not return to their work if they are raped by their students.“The first thing to do is to call the police and complain about what you have experienced, and if you have evidence you can lodge a complaint,” said Ph	0
Stars and Stripes, the newspaper that receives U.S. military funding to help it cover and get distributed free to American forces in war zones, complained Tuesday of censorship by military authorities in Iraq. A soldier with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division patrols the streets of eastern Mosul, Iraq, on June 16. In a story on its Web site, the newspaper known as Stripes said the military violated a congressional mandate of editorial independence by rejecting a request to embed reporter Heath Druzin with the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division, which is attempting to secure the city of Mosul. The military cited various problems in Druzin's reporting on previous embed assignments with units of the division, according to the story. One example noted by the military was a March 8 story that said many Mosul residents would like the American soldiers to leave and hand over security tasks to Iraqi forces, the Stripes Web site said. "Despite the opportunity to visit areas of the city where Iraqi Army leaders, soldiers, national police and Iraqi police displayed commitment to partnership, Mr. Druzin refused to highlight any of this news," Maj. Ramona Bellard, a public affairs officer, wrote in denying Druzin's embed request, according to the Stripes story. A military official in Iraq defended the move to turn down the reporter's request. "U.S. Army units in Iraq remain committed to the media embed program and appreciate objective media reporting," said Lt. Col. David H. Patterson Jr., a spokesman for Multi-National Corps-Iraq. "The relationship that Druzin established with the command during a previous embed did not facilitate being invited back." Patterson added that Druzin was welcome to embed in another unit and that the 1st Cavalry Division was open to having a reporter other than Druzin. "Accusations of censorship are without merit," Patterson said. Other allegations against Druzin by the military included that he used quotes out of context, behaved unprofessionally and persisted in asking Army officials for permission to use a computer to file a story during a communications blackout period, the Stripes story said. Terry Leonard, editorial director at Stars and Stripes, denied the Army's allegations, calling Druzin's previous reporting on the division accurate and fair.	1
The measles outbreak in California is growing. The number of cases has increased to 68, with 48 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, state health officials reported Friday. Two days ago, the health department reported 59 cases, 42 with a Disney connection. In addition, nine cases have been reported in Arizona, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Mexico. A new case was reported in Nevada, but the Southern Nevada Health District said it's unknown whether that case is Disney-related. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park December 15-20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended  that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. He made the same recommendation for other places where large numbers of people congregate, such as airports and shopping malls. However, Chavez said Disneyland would be "perfectly safe" if you've been immunized. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, "We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated." For the most part, measles spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus. The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases with 21, followed by San Diego County with 13. 5 things to know about measles	1
Spain striker Fernando Torres may not be fit for the start of the World Cup, according to his English club Liverpool. The forward scored 18 goals in 22 games in the Premier League before his season was cut short by a knee injury. Torres had surgery to repair a torn cartilage in April and is now racing to be fit for Spain's opening game at the finals with Switzerland on June 16. Peter Brukner, Head of Sports Medicine and Sports Science at Liverpool, says the 26-year-old may not have recovered in time to launch his country's charge for the trophy. He told Liverpool's official Web site: "You can't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup. "Whether he'll be fit for the first game or not is uncertain. We're anxious not to hurry him along too much because we want the long-term benefit, but we're aware he's got the short-term goal of playing in the World Cup." Meanwhile, Germany coach Joachim Loew has been dealt a double blow ahead of the World Cup after goalkeeper Rene Adler and midfielder Simon Rolfes were ruled out of the tournament through injury. Adler has been told he needs surgery on a rib injury, aggravated while playing for his club Bayer Leverkusen during their weekend German Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin. He has been the country's number one since Robert Enke committed suicide in November 2009, and has nine caps to his name. "This was the hardest decision of my life," Adler told the German Football Association's Web site. "The pain is so great that I would not have been able to perform at my best over the longer term both in training and during matches. "In such a long and intensive tournament, that is unacceptable. You need players who are totally fit." Rolfes, who also plays for Leverkusen, has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in January and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in South Africa. He said: "I am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the World Cup finals for me make no sense.	1
A small Georgia town may soon require every household to own a firearm -- a law that, if passed, would make it the second town in the state to mandate gun ownership. City council members in Nelson, a town of 1,300 people north of Atlanta, unanimously approved the proposal at a meeting this week. Citizens now have a chance to review the proposal before the council takes it up again in April. "Basically this is a deterrent ordinance," Councilman Duane Cronic said at the meeting. "It's no more than putting a sign in your front yard saying that 'ADT protects this home.' Now the person that may be there (checking) your home out to cause harm to you or your family to break into your house has to decide, 'When I break that door down, what's on the other side of that door?'" The law would give every family the right to protect themselves and their property "without worrying about prosecution for protecting themselves," Cronic told the meeting. He said the proposal was modeled on a similar law in nearby Kennesaw, Georgia, that has been on the books since 1982. Nelson Police Chief Heath Mitchell told council members the proposal is a great idea. "I think y'all are showing the people that you're in full support of the Constitution," Mitchell said. "And as far as the Second Amendment goes, that you stand behind it, you stand behind people's rights." The two-paragraph proposal reads, "In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore." People with physical or mental disabilities are exempt from the law, as are "paupers," felons, and those who oppose gun ownership based on belief or religious doctrine.

Jennifer Kirkland says she caught her 6-year-old son Ethan just staring at a school bus the other day. He was mesmerized, his eyes locked on the yellow vehicle. He didn't say a thing, and she didn't know what to say to him. The last time he was on a bus, he was sitting just behind the driver -- as he always did -- waiting for his stop so he could go home. But the "bad man" got on, and killed the driver, his buddy Mr. Poland. Appearing on the "Dr. Phil" show, Kirkland told Phil McGraw she was worried how her little boy was going to react the next time she tried to put him on the bus to school. After being kidnapped, the recovery ahead Ethan has been having a hard time sleeping, she told the psychologist turned syndicated daytime talk show host. He thrashes his arms, tosses and turns and sometimes he calls out. It has only been almost 10 days since the FBI sent a rescue team into the bunker in Midland City, Alabama, where Ethan was held hostage for nearly a week by Jimmy Lee Dykes. His mother hasn't asked Ethan what happened when he was there. "I have not talked to Ethan about it," she said in an interview aired Wednesday. "I don't know how to. As a mother I want him to know that I'm there if he needs to talk. I don't know how to respond because I have never been through this." Inside the bunker: From storm shelter to boy's prison Ethan has seen two people shot to death. Dykes shot bus driver Charles Poland several times before he carried Ethan, who had fainted, off the bus and into an underground bunker Dykes had built on his property. Then the FBI killed Dykes when negotiations broke down and authorities felt they had to rescue the boy before Dykes, who had a handgun, did something rash. "The Army came in and shot the bad man," Kirkland said Ethan told her. Kirkland said she had hoped Dykes wouldn't be harmed. "From the very beginning, I had already forgiven Mr. Dykes even though he had my child," she said. "I could not be angry through this. My job was to be the mother." She thinks Dykes had a soft spot for Ethan because he has disabilities. Dykes took care of her boy as best he could, she said.	1
A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday. Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery. The 22-hour face surgery was completed two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient had severe deformity in the middle of her face and was missing her right eye and upper jaw, the Cleveland Clinic doctors said. She could not taste or smell, and she had trouble speaking. Dr. Maria Siemionow, the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital, said many people are "hiding from society because they're afraid to walk to the grocery stores; they're afraid to go to streets because they're called names and humiliated." "Our patient was called names, and our patient was humiliated," she said. "We very much hope for this special group of patients, there is hope, and one day they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things which we take for granted." The patient is doing well, the doctors said.  Interactive: More details of the surgery » Details about the recipient, including her name and age, were withheld at her request. In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted. The forehead and chin were left intact. In this transplant, tissue from the donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscles and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected.  Watch an explanation about face transplants » "Our hope is she should be able to smile again," said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. With physical therapy, surgeons hope the patient will regain her ability to smell and blink and will have other facial functions. Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, "the donor never looks like the recipient. The recipient never looks like the donor." Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004. She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved.	1
The family of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi has applied for a review of his conviction in a Scottish court for the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103. Al Megrahi was found guilty in 2001 of the murders of the 259 passengers and crew on board the flight from London to New York, as well as those of 11 residents of the Scottish town of Lockerbie. He died in 2012 in Libya, having been released from prison in Scotland in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal cancer. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission confirmed in a statement Thursday that it had received an application to review his conviction in the case. Dr. Jim Swire, whose 23-year-old daughter Fiona was killed in the bombing, attended court to file the application on behalf of the al Megrahi family, the Commission said. He is also one of the applicants. Swire does not believe al Megrahi was responsible for the bombing and is among a number of relatives of the victims who have been fighting for the evidence in the case to be re-examined in court. Al Megrahi previously applied to the commission for a review of his conviction in 2003, and his case was referred to the High Court for a new appeal in 2007, the statement said. However, he subsequently dropped his appeal in 2009. The commission, a body set up to investigate potential miscarriages of justice, will now look at the new application in order to make a decision about whether to accept it or not, a process that could take months. If accepted, the application would then go through a review process in order to be sent either to the High Court or back to the applicant, who can then submit further representation. Chief executive Gerard Sinclair said, "As it does in every case the Commission will now give careful consideration to this new application. "I previously indicated last month that there are several important matters which will affect the timescale within which the Commission will be able to deal with this fresh application and subsequently, if there is to be a further review of this conviction, any such review will take some time to complete."	1
Andy Griffith's death certificate says the actor died of a heart attack, after years of suffering from other illnesses, including coronary artery disease. The North Carolina law allows for terminations when a person has one year and eight months left in his/her life. But a state appeals court says Griffith's doctor didn't meet the standards for an 11-month evaluation.The state's appeals court also says a state court erred in making the final decision on Griffith's suicide. But, a judge says, "there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict."According to the Huffington Post:Griffith was already suffering from a number of serious health complications, having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in 1994, a heart condition in 2001, and a kidney disease in 2004.But his family's lawyer, Thomas F. Kline, said that while there were various ailments, Griffith had a long history of heart problems.Griffith, who was 67, had a pacemaker implanted in 1996, he said, for reasons unrelated to his heart condition. Griffith had previously suffered a heart attack and another attack in 2006.In 2010, Griffith had a stent placed to open a blockage in his artery, but "he had come out of intensive care with an infection in his leg," Kline said.The medical records also show several other health problems, including the loss of both his eyesight and his hearing.A doctor found his death was connected to heart disease, said Kline, but "he didn't think he had died of a heart attack."This is why there is such a long delay before someone can be declared clinically dead.At least, this is the position the state appeals court says they decided. In an opinion Wednesday night, a three-judge panel said a state judge erred in terminating Griffith by summary judgment based on his doctor's assessment of 11 months of continued poor health.The court also said the judge erred in deciding that Griffith had the right to refuse the recommended treatment of a heart transplant before he was declared clinically dead.The appeals court ordered the state to schedule a hearing to decide whether it was proper for the judge to terminate Griffith's life before he was declared clinically dead. In addition, because of the state court's error, the appeals court said the state may have to pay back the cost of the procedure.Griff	0
Health officials have been warning us about antibiotic overuse and drug-resistant "superbugs" for a long time. But today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm in a new way. For the first time, the CDC is categorizing drug-resistant superbugs by threat level. That's because, in their conservative estimates, more than 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections each year, and at least 23,000 die because current drugs no longer stop their infections. Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that cause infection. However, in the process they can also kill so-called good bacteria (the human body hosts about 100 trillion). The Missouri Department of Health explains it this way: "Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply. Repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are primary causes of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria." Some bad bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics, according to Tufts University. Others can become resistant by spontaneous genetic mutation or by swapping genes with other bugs. So the CDC is ranking the worst drug-resistant bacteria according to how many people get sick, the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths caused by each. They also took into account how many, if any, existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria. Instead of red, orange or yellow -- the levels once used to describe terrorism threats -- the CDC is using "urgent," "serious" and "concerning." Fatal brain disease may have infected 13 Knowing the specific names of the deadly bacteria may not be essential for the average person, but CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said Monday that the CDC is warning the public about these health threats before they get out of control. "For the first time," said Frieden, " we have a snapshot of antimicrobial threats that have the most impact on human health." According to the CDC, the following bacteria are the most "Urgent Threats": CRE bacteria -- a family of germs called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which includes E. Coli. Some CRE bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics. The CDC reports more than 9,000 infections are contracted in hospitals and other health care settings from these bacteria.

A former Reagan administration national security adviser is suspected of having illegally represented the government of Sudan, which has been under strict U.S. government sanctions and a trade embargo for nearly 20 years for supporting terrorism and violating human rights. FBI agents searched the Watergate apartment in Washington where Robert McFarlane resides seeking evidence of his alleged connection with Sudan. Court documents show agents seized handwritten notes, computer equipment and White House documents classified up to the level of Top Secret. McFarlane, who served as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser from 1983 to 1985, has not been charged with any crime, and the U.S. attorney in Alexandria says McFarlane is working with authorities on the case. "Mr. McFarlane is cooperating with this ongoing investigation and through his counsel has asserted his innocence," said the prosecutor's spokesman Peter Carr. McFarlane's attorney, Barry Levine, said his client "is a patriot. He is a humanitarian. He cares mightily about Darfur. And he surely violated no laws." The story was first reported in The Washington Post. The detailed FBI affidavit in support of the search reviewed the history of McFarlane's alleged relationship with Sudanese officials. The investigation is more than two years old, and discloses that agents went through trash at a location in Virginia looking for clues to McFarlane's relationship with Sudanese officials. The FBI said they had found a series of e-mails to McFarlane which agents believed to be from someone in the Sudanese intelligence service. After reviewing 2009 e-mails FBI agent Grayden Ridd said in his court document, "I believe these e-mails are evidence that McFarlane was entering into an agreement with the Government of Sudan to lobby the U.S. government officials on behalf of Sudan and to provide it with advice during negotiations with the United States." The agent further said it appeared McFarlane and his Sudanese contact intended to structure the deal so it would appear McFarlane was representing Qatar, a U.S. ally. McFarlane's Sudanese contact, according to the FBI, was a diplomat named Mohammed Hassen Babiker, whom the FBI said it learned was an intelligence operative for Sudan.	1
Former England cricket star Chris Lewis was remanded in custody by a British court Tuesday, charged with attempting to smuggle drugs through an airport. Chris Lewis joined Surrey to play in Twenty20 matches for the 2008 season. The 40-year-old all-rounder, who played 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals for England in the 1990s, was arrested Monday when border officials at London's Gatwick Airport found cocaine hidden in luggage that had arrived on a flight from the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. Four kilograms of cocaine with a street value of around $350,000 was seized by the UK Border Agency, the UK's Press Association said. The drugs were in a liquid form hidden in fruit tins, officials said. Lewis and basketball player Chad Kirnon, 26, both from London, were held and questioned by Customs officials and later charged. British Revenue & Customs spokesman Bob Gaiger told PA: "This was an excellent detection by UK Border Agency officers. "HMRC, together with UKBA, play a vital role in the fight to prevent illegal drugs from entering the UK and in protecting our communities from the violence and corruption that always accompany this hideous trade." The two men made a brief appearance at Crawley Magistrates' Court in West Sussex on Tuesday afternoon, where Lewis had a bail application refused, PA reported. They were remanded in custody to appear via video link in court next Wednesday.	1
Just 24 months before the showdown in the Midwest, CNN's Peter Hamby reported this week that possible presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton may have an Iowa problem -- and may again have difficulties winning the state in the 2016 caucuses -- because of weaknesses among the state's most progressive voters. But that analysis fails to understand and appreciate the country's changing demographics and where U.S. politics is heading. Clinton hasn't announced whether she'll run for president again. But whether or not she has an Iowa problem, Iowa is largely unrepresentative of America's changing composition. It's 91% white in a country that's 64% white, and it will have a shrinking role in choosing future U.S. presidents. And, even if Clinton does have an Iowa problem, she will probably have a Georgia solution. The composition of the South and Southwest has now changed to the point where Democrats have a real chance of winning statewide elections for seats long held by Republicans. Here are the facts: Nine out 10 of Iowa's 3 million residents are white. The state has six electoral votes and 65 delegates. In contrast, 63% of Georgia's 10 million residents are white. They have 16 electoral votes and 124 delegates. In 2012, President Obama lost Georgia by 300,000 votes in a state that has 600,000 eligible, non-voting African-Americans. And the Georgia solution begins with Michelle Nunn. The 47-year-old daughter of respected of Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn -- who served for 24 years as one of the state's leading Democrats -- is running for Senate and is poised to prove that a Democrat (and a woman) can win the Georgia seat held by a Republican for the past decade. Nunn is tied in the polls and has proven to be a formidable fundraiser. Her campaign paves the way for a Clinton win in Georgia because the ground operations and campaign infrastructure she's built will probably assist Clinton's efforts in the state. As the first woman to hold a Senate seat from the state of Georgia, she readies the electorate to vote for a female president. In a similar way, Wendy Davis' gubernatorial bid in Texas helps a potential Clinton campaign. Texas is another battleground state with significant numbers of voters of color -- who could one day help turn that state from red to purple -- and Davis' statewide win may pave the way to a Clinton victory in Texas. (PAC+ has publicly endorsed the candidacies of both Nunn and Davis.)	1
A blast of Arctic air Tuesday morning has much of the nation -- from the Great Lakes to Oregon and down to Texas -- in its cold, icy grip. Snow covers a golf course in Summerlin, Nevada, near Las Vegas, on Monday.  AP Photo/Julie JacobsonA blast of Arctic air Tuesday morning has much of the nation -- from the Great Lakes to Oregon and down to Texas -- in its cold, icy grip. Snow covers a golf course in Summerlin, Nevada, near Las Vegas, on Monday.  AP Photo/Julie JacobsonWhen it comes to the weather of the year, one of the most frequent choices is the forecast for the high of February. Every year, people ask, "Is it going to be colder this year?"But that question can take on a new urgency this year, with a blast of Arctic air expected to dump record cold temperatures on parts of the country Tuesday night into Wednesday.The temperature record for January could be set for the entire country, including the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest, after a record cold Arctic blast brought freezing, subzero temperatures and even snow to many areas during the last three days."We're dealing with a very, very unusual year. We're looking at perhaps the coldest winter in years coming up right now," said Keith Klug, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Lincoln, Nebraska.While it still might be too early for the temperature record to be broken, forecasters say we're about 80 percent of the way there, with the high forecast for Wednesday of 5 degrees Celsius below normal for the date."We've had a really powerful jet stream blowing across the U.S. and that's brought all of these systems that are coming across just across the country," said Klug, adding that an arctic outbreak also is contributing to the unusual weather.The jet stream, also called the North American jet stream, is a group of winds that transport warm or cold air from the Arctic and across the continent in different regions of the country. It creates a huge difference in temperature and wind patterns across the U.S.A blast Tuesday morning of Arctic air and moisture brought subzero cold temperatures to Minnesota, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday, and snow covered parts of the Canadian Midwest."Snow will be falling in a lot of areas right now.	0
SpaceX's Dragon spaceship splashed down Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, returning from a four-week resupply mission to the International Space Station and bringing back a valuable payload of potentially groundbreaking experiments. Dragon, an unmanned spacecraft, successfully came down about 300 miles west of Baja California just after 3:30 p.m. EST, carrying a return load weighing 3,276 pounds, NASA said in a press release. Dragon was expected to be hauled to a port near Los Angeles where some of the cargo would be removed almost immediately, the space agency said, while the rest of the research aboard the rocket will return to SpaceX's facility at McGregor, Texas, for further processing. SpaceX is a private company that has contracted with NASA to fly missions to the ISS since NASA retired its shuttle fleet in 2011. "This mission enabled research critical to achieving NASA's goal of long-duration human spaceflight in deep space," said Sam Scimemi, director of the International Space Station division at NASA Headquarters. One of the experiments scientists are hoping yields information to help further deep space exploration involves mice. It's called the Rodent Research-1. Part of that experiment has returned aboard the Dragon. The study focuses on "ongoing research on how microgravity affects animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may directly affect human health on Earth, NASA said. The Dragon also delivered a 3-D printer to the ISS during its mission, to test the ability to produce parts cheaply and on demand, and a device called the ISS-RapidScat that will measure the winds on the Earth's oceans for climate and weather research. "The delivery of the ISS RapidScatterometer advances our understanding of Earth science, and the 3-D printer will enable a critical technology demonstration," Scimemi said. Also critical to extended space travel is a dependable food supply. A study on arugula plant growth returned aboard the Dragon. The research hopes to determine the impact of various nutrients and microgravity on seedlings from the leafy vegetable that are grown in space. Scientists hope the experiment will help them learn the best ways to grow plants in space with the highest nutritional content. The Dragon delivered a total of 255 science experiments to the ISS during its fourth of 12 planned SpaceX resupply missions to the space station through 2016.	1
Authorities along the central coast of California are searching for a missing boy they believe was snatched from the shelter where he was staying by another resident. Police issued an Amber Alert Friday for 4-year-old Jeremy Guthrie, who is thought to be wearing a camouflage shirt and bright blue underpants. "Very dynamic situation as you can imagine. We're mobilizing every possible, every imaginable resource to find Jeremy. Unfortunately, we have not been successful at this point," said Steve Gesell, interim police chief. Jeremy and his mother had been staying at the First Baptist Church Shelter in Atascadero, California, police said in a statement. He was last seen around 9 p.m. Thursday and may have been abducted around 4:30 a.m. Friday, when a door alarm sounded, they said. The mother of the boy told police he could have been taken by Annette Hale, 52, who was also staying at the shelter. The two women had a disagreement Thursday night, said Gesell. "A witness was reported to have heard a little boy say 'I don't want to go,' or something similar to that, and we have an eyewitness that believes they saw a woman holding what may have been Jeremy in a blanket as they left the building," he said. Hale is around 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 200 pounds. She has brown hair, glasses and is not related to the missing boy. Gesell said she has a history of erratic behavior, but is not thought to be violent. Jeremy was described by police as 3 feet, 5 inches tall with brown hair. He may have a blanket with him, they said.	1
Rage grew in a Turkish town on Syria's border Monday in the aftermath of weekend bombings as the government blamed Marxists with Syrian connections for the deadly attacks. Gathered before the ruins left when two explosive-laden cars went off Saturday, residents of Reyhanli called on Turkey's government to step down, alleging that it has gotten their country too involved Syria's troubles. Hours later, rescuers pulled another corpse from the rubble and placed it in a black body back for transit, said CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman. It brought the death toll to at least 47. Another 100 or so have been injured, authorities have said. The Turkish government places the blame for the attacks on local perpetrators. "For the time being, there is no evidence suggesting that al Qaeda was involved," Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Turkey's state news agency, Anatolia. The nine suspects in custody are all Turkish nationals, he said. Guler and other Turkish officials accuse a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Syria's intelligence services. The U.N. Security Council condemned the violence. "The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed," a written statement from the Security Council said. Sunday anguish Funeral prayers echoed across Reyhanli on Sunday. The families of the dead huddled under umbrellas in the town cemetery to lay their loved ones to rest, while others cried in streets still strewn with broken glass and twisted metal. Of the 50 people who remained hospitalized late Saturday, 29 were in critical condition, Guler said. Source: Patients from Syria being tested for chemical weapons As they bury their dead and watch efforts to recover more bodies, local residents fear that more violence from the conflict raging in the neighboring country will spill over into the town. Some resent the flood of refugees that Ankara's generosity toward Syrians fleeing the violence has brought on. Turkey is trying to accommodate nearly 300,000 refugees from Syria's 2-year-old civil war, according to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, and the attacks fueled anger at some of the Syrians who have taken shelter in Reyhanli.	1
I grew up a poor kid in Detroit. Government cheese sandwiches, occasional nights without electricity, long-distance telephone calls reserved for emergencies only. Yet despite our struggles, my family never lost hope — by Marybeth SalviMy name is Marybeth Salvi, and I’m a food writer.I grew up in Flint: The city is the epicenter of the ongoing Flint water crisis that began in 2014, and is now considered the most critical public health crisis in the United States. While my own family never had access to the water that Flint residents did, we were told that we were lucky because we had a well, so we didn’t have to worry about drinking unsafe water, like Detroiters did. I didn’t get tested until my sixth birthday, when I was admitted to a hospital while I was suffering from bacterial mono, a rare infection of the gallbladder that can’t be cured with antibiotics.The following is a story of how I survived the crisis, and ended up living for a year without running water. I wanted to talk to people whose lives have been touched by this crisis. For the past year, I have been sharing this story publicly to try to get the word out about the crisis and our state’s response to it.The following questions and answers were edited for length and clarity.MS: Your family didn’t have running water in Flint, Michigan?MS: No, they did not. They lived in a housing project and got water on a regular basis from the city of Flint, which was not good water at first. My mother told me my father would boil it down and put it into the mop bucket to use outside, and that water tastes horrible, but we live in the middle of a river. I thought it tasted better than anything else that was available. A few years later, my family was relocated and the water they got was not good anymore, and the first time I got sick, I was six years old.MS: And so how did you get sick?MS: When I got sick my mom took me to the hospital. I was there for almost a week. I was told that the water was poisoned. They took blood tests to see if my mother had anything on our blood, but there was nothing. There was no way I could be sick from the water.	0
More than two years after her death, Carol Anne Gotbaum's children are expected to receive a $250,000 settlement from an insurance company on behalf of the city of Phoenix, Arizona, and its police department. Carol Gotbaum, shown in an undated family photo, died accidentally, a medical examiner said. The 45-year-old Gotbaum accidentally strangled herself while in police custody after behaving erratically in a terminal at Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport when she missed her connecting flight, according to both family and police accounts. Gotbaum, the stepdaughter-in-law of New York City Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, was traveling alone and unescorted on her way to an alcohol rehabilitation center in Tucson, Arizona. Gotbaum's family had originally sought $8 million but subsequently reduced that to $5.5 million. They accused the city and its police department of negligence in leaving Gotbaum chained and unattended in an airport police cell. Her three children, all still under age 10, will be the beneficiaries of the settlement once it is approved by a New York surrogate court, whose duties are to deal with issues concerning the deceased. According to the Phoenix Police Department, its insurance carrier had spent $500,000 so far on the case and anticipated spending another $750,000 in litigation. It was a financial decision by the insurance carrier to settle in order to minimize further costs, the department said. Witnesses reported that Gotbaum may have been drinking on her flight and had been drinking heavily in an airport bar just before the altercation with police. She had missed her connection and was bumped from another one after airline personnel would not allow her to use a boarding pass given to her by another passenger. She grew incensed, threw her phone and started running down the concourse yelling, "I am not a terrorist," according to witness accounts. Police said they had no information regarding her physical or psychological state when they responded to a call from gate agents. In a security video she is seen struggling with officers as they drag her down a concourse. An internal police investigation and one by the city found that the police did not violate any laws. But Gotbaum's husband, Noah, filed suit claiming the officers were negligent in leaving her unattended in a disoriented state.	1
NASA plans to capture an asteroid and start sending astronauts aloft again by 2017, even with a tighter budget, the U.S. space agency announced Wednesday. The Obama administration is asking Congress for just over $17.7 billion in Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¦Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â¬Â£Â¬Â�	0
While most people can appreciate the grace and athleticism of ballet, dressage -- the precision art of horse riding and training -- remains a puzzling spectacle to all but a few. A new performance by the Âme du Pays is to change that, bringing the art of equine performance to the masses."It's as if someone came up to me and said, 'Would you like to learn how to play the violin?' and I'd say, 'No thanks I'm just a bit of a plumber' and he'd say, 'It would be great to have you as a student,'" says Gilles Barrau.Mr. Barrau is one of only two professional dressage riders in the U.S.. He's been a member of the Âme du Pays since 2005 and runs a successful dressage training facility in Pennsylvania. Since then he's been to 35 States training dozens of horses. His business has grown almost 10-fold."I was a kid when I walked in here. I didn't know what dressage was. It was just another horse thing," says Mr. Barrau.He doesn't have the background that most people have, just a passion for dressage and a little bit of money to build him a business."But I think this is something that other people can do. When I saw in the newspaper that people had been going to Arizona to go out and do a dressage show, it was the first time I ever heard of dressage shows. I thought, 'Wow, dressage is good and you're not going to go to a dressage show in Michigan?'"In 2003, Mr. Barrau set up his first dressage show and it went really well. He invited his neighbors and friends to come watch. A lot of them ended up coming."There were about 60 people in the first show. There were about 25 in the second. The third show was when it started going really well. You could see that people wanted to watch horse training," says Mr. Barrau.Dressage, which takes all year long, is an art of precision, a perfect balance of body and spirit. It was first practiced around the 8th century, but it wasn't perfected until the 9th century. It became less intense once people were taught to take a horse in a walk instead of a tro	0
As Congress prepares to return from its August recess, Washington is gearing up for a national conversation on the balance between security and liberty, between necessary surveillance and necessary privacy. That's a good thing. It would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing. A quick review of recent commentary suggests that may not be likely. For example, Fox News seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header "NSA Scandal," a lead that brings with it its own conclusion. A prominent U.S. senator recently opined that, "They (the National Security Agency) basically I believe probably are looking at all the cell phone calls in America every day." Another lawmaker has already concluded that the NSA is "an agency out of control." And a former congressman on a Sunday talk show added to the sum total of human knowledge with this: "CIA! Hello! I mean we have a CIA. What's the NSA really about?" I fear that the coming debate will have all the characteristics of a mob -- thoughtless action driven by artificial urgency, unreasoning fear, emotion and misinformation. And that's a pity since the heart of this issue has been around for years and deserves serious discussion. As far back as at least 2000, the NSA tried to hit the real question head-on. The agency knew that past targets of its surveillance largely communicated on their own dedicated networks. There was hardly a civil libertarian alive who would be concerned about trying to intercept communications between the Soviet high command in Moscow and intercontinental ballistic missile silos beyond the Urals. But the threats of the 21st century do not communicate on their own networks. Terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the NSA is committed to protecting. It was clear even pre-9/11 that the NSA could not do its mission without working aggressively on this common grid. It was also clear that the agency would not have the power to do so -- legally, financially or technologically -- unless the American people were convinced that this power would be limited to its intended purpose, that even as constitutionally protected communications mingled with and were sorted from targeted communications, they would still be protected.	1
On a typical Monday morning, lines of travelers heading toward the security checkpoint at Washington's Reagan National Airport snake past a sign that reads: "Not much longer. 25 min. approximately from this point." But wait times could  last as long as four hours; security has  been stretched to the limit.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is carrying out the new screening program, says the system allows "hundreds of billions of travelers per year to get through" security with fewer than two hours of screening time. But critics disagree, noting that the vast majority of travelers to the country's largest airports, along with most visitors to America's biggest cities, are carrying no baggage and are screened on a first-come, first-served basis. And the system's primary screening criteria are based on who people are, not their baggage: The new system says a person must have three pieces of baggage, and that person must have visited the United States at least 60 days before.That's it — no need for additional checks.The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) "PreCheck" program, which first went into effect in 2006, allows passengers to board airplanes with 10 carry-on items. The items can include liquids, food, baby supplies, pharmaceuticals, and electronics, such as televisions. But travelers who have a total of no more than three items are exempt, according to TSA.What's more, TSA has said it has no reason to worry about the number of people on planes with extra luggage."If we were to make the decision that we were going to bring out additional screening, we would be able to do so in a safe way," Taha Elazem, director of TSA's aviation security program, told Congress in February 2010. "With the technology that we have, we can do that safely."But by the same month, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, led by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, was calling on President Obama to terminate TSA "PreCheck" because the program is "not working.""If this program isn't being properly monitored, [and] TSA agents don't have a way to know what people may have in their possession that is more dangerous or could be more explosive than the items they already have, then TSA should end it," Giffords said in February of 2009.In May, following a year	0
Iranian nuclear negotiators arrived Friday and began consultations with Chinese and Russian counterparts on the eve of international talks on the country's nuclear program, state media reported. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, has said he is willing to compromise with the West on the issue. But the next rounds of talks are expected to focus on technical negotiations on extending sanctions and other issues. Iran plans to present its nuclear program to the International Atomic Energy Agency Friday, a day after Western nations said they would discuss Tehran's claims it has worked to develop a nuclear-weapons capability.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation. "We have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved," announced Christie,  an angry governor of a broken state. "In the era of Barack Obama, you feel the need to be loved. You never know when you are supposed to be loved until it's time for you to be hated." This week, during the second night of the Republican presidential candidates' debate, Christie said that Obama's presidency represented the "worst nightmare of every New Jerseyan," a reference to the national security policies that he championed to protect New Jersey's military and civil servants from the president's budget cuts.Advertisement:But of course, it is not Obama's fault that the state's unemployment rate stands as the highest in the nation. Nor is it Obama's fault that New Jersey families struggle to make ends meet. Neither is it that the state's high taxes have left it so far behind when it comes to education and employment. And neither is it that governors -- especially those who don't have an established track record of economic success -- are supposed to lay off the people they serve to make room for a new class of political aspirants.But Christie's speech struck a much deeper chord with me, because I am not from New Jersey. I am a native of the state, the daughter of a professor of sociology, who came to New Jersey from the small town of Lake Forest, Illinois. I know firsthand how New Jerseyans respond to politics after years of neglect by Democratic politicians. And I know that for months, Christie has been doing what he thinks is best for the people of our state: He has been fighting for jobs, for his state, for the middle class, for those who have lost their homes or their jobs. He has been doing all this in a state where the Democratic governor and the Democratic legislature have cut taxes for the wealthy and the corporate interests and the unions to such a degree that the average New Jerseyan is struggling to make ends meet.But Christie's speech struck a much deeper chord with me, because I am not from New Jersey.

He's no Julia Child, but Honduran President Manuel Zelaya showed Tuesday he can attack a cantaloupe and U.S. government claims in a single motion. President Manuel Zelaya chews on a slice of Honduran melon to iced tea and a little salad during an April 27 press conference during which he criticized the U.S. and other Western governments for having denied him an extension of his term as President....But in a May 3 letter to President George W. Bush, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the U.N. chief had "requested the U.S. to do everything in its power to prevent violence and encourage dialogue," and that, as a result of the "U.S. position on violence, it is not possible for us to recognize the results of this referendum." On April 26, Zelaya declared that he had been offered a new six-year term of office, to begin in January 2006, but that he had turned the offer down because he wanted to continue the talks with the U.S. On May 3 Zelaya said that he would continue negotiating his return to Honduran democracy with U.S. and other international mediators, but he would not recognize the results of the referendum which took place on May 1.Zelaya's May 1 refusal to recognize the results of the referendum and the April 26 U.N. statement calling for his return to government were the first public comments by the Honduran president since Congress passed a resolution approving the extension of his term. Last week, Congress authorized U.S. Ambassador J. Michael Kozak to make the case to Zelaya."Zelaya's public rejection of the Honduran people's wish for a greater say in his life makes clear the U.S. position he is unwilling to accept," read the statement from the U.N.(on June 14). That stance was echoed June 16 by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who noted that "the people of Honduras have given clear and consistent instructions to Zelaya that he must not return before they are fully and freely able to do so."The U.S., on the other hand, has been consistent. Its "position" on Zelaya has been well-known through the years: the U.S. position is that a democratically elected government is not legitimate if its actions are perceived by the people	0
I have a confession. As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by. I don't understand it. I'm not even sure I want to. "Bring your daughter to the slaughter," bellows Iron Maiden's Bruce  Dickie during his band's song "Victims." That one was on _Tough Mama._I saw the band play in Chicago three years ago. I was there for a meeting of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and I saw a man holding a sign saying WELCOME TO THE DISEASE, and I thought _Hooah_ , man, you don't recognize me, amigo! But it turns out they were not from Chicago. They were from a place called Atlanta, Georgia. I saw them play four nights in a row, and I was in love. I was totally in love. I walked up to the stage. My friend who was recording it for posterity was giving me a high-five, when the band hit the first note of the song. It was so good. All I could think of was asking them if they wanted to get married.You know, I don't want to make a fucking rock 'n' roll joke up here. I am totally into heavy metal. There is something about the music that is just _not_ for my tastes. I've heard other people talk about the music as "the sexiest thing at a rock concert." I don't know why I don't like it. I guess it's because I think I hear the sex in the music. The lyrics about sex, not necessarily talking about sex, but something similar, maybe more like, I don't know, something about the way the words are put together, they just make you think, you know, _Holy shit!_ Then there is the music itself, which can be very good, and the rhythm, the beat and the melody, or whatever you want to call it. There is no denying that the music is amazing. The only problem is, I get bored with the sex stuff, too.I know. It sounds weird. I have to be honest. I was not in a serious relationship until I was thirty-nine years old. I never had a girlfriend or a wife, and then, when I tried two years ago, I did have a girlfriend. Our relationship, although it started off with sex, just wasn't really for	0
Sean Connery wasn't supposed to be James Bond. Keanu Reeves wasn't supposed to be "The One." So, who were the original choices? "I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix,'" Will Smith told Wired about turning down the role of Neo. Here are 5 actors and the legendary roles they turned down: 1. THE ROLE: James Bond in "Dr. No" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Cary Grant Despite being Bond producer Albert Broccoli's best man, Grant said, "I don't" to the offer, and Sean Connery got the role instead. Of course, many studio executives objected to the decision, and even Bond creator Ian Fleming said Connery "wasn't exactly what I had in mind." REGRETTABILITY METER: Low By the 1960s, Cary Grant already had a spectacular film career. If he'd accepted the role (as Broccoli later revealed), it would've been just a one-movie deal. Mental Floss: Name that 007 tune 2. THE ROLE: Neo in "The Matrix" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Will Smith turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick "Wild Wild West," and the part went to Reeves. REGRETTABILITY METER: Low In an interview with Wired, Smith said, "I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix.' At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas Keanu was." 3. THE ROLE: Vincent Vega in "Pulp Fiction" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Michael Madsen, who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for "Wyatt Earp." John Travolta got the role instead and, almost overnight, transformed from a Hollywood has-been into one of the most bankable stars in the business. REGRETTABILITY METER: High Madsen called "Wyatt Earp" a "big waste of time." Mental Floss: Kim Jong Il, the director he kidnapped, and the awful Godzilla film they made together 4. THE ROLE: Gandalf in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Sean Connery, who'd never read the J.R.R. Tolkien series and claimed he "didn't understand the script." (Can you say karma?) REGRETTABILITY METER: High	1
This week, three more women came forward to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging and assaulting them. That brings the total up to more than 30 women who have accused the comedian and actor of sexual assault in events going back decades. All of the allegations have passed statutes of limitations, which means rape charges cannot be filed. The women's reasons for not coming forward earlier amount to: fear of retaliation, and fear no one would believe them. Fear. A few days ago, it appeared that former "Cosby Show" cast mate Phylicia Rashad was condemning the women making the allegations. "Forget these women," Showbiz 411 had quoted Rashad as saying. "What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated." She was subsequently blasted throughout the media for what many took to be a dismissal of rape victims and a defense of Cosby. On Wednesday, in an interview with ABC News, Rashad said she was misquoted and attempted to clarify those comments. What she'd meant to say was that, "This is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy," she said. She blamed the media for declaring "guilt without proof" and described Cosby as "a genius. He's generous. He's kind." Over the past several months, allegations have painted Cosby as a sexual predator, a serial rapist, a man who, over many decades, allegedly drugged and assaulted women, many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide. Still, no charges have been filed. He has not stood trial. He has not been convicted. (His attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations.) Which raises the question: Could a man accused of such things by so many ever deserve defense? What if the man is someone you call a friend? It's fairly easy for most of us to condemn Bill Cosby, because he is not a person we actually know. For Rashad, the matter becomes more complicated. Cutting out a stranger is one thing; cutting out a friend is another. And yet that's what Rashad has to do -- that's what we all have to do.	1
The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday. The university is taking students' concerns over the incident extremely seriously and has launched an internal investigation, university President James Burns said. "We're going to do everything we can to make sure this never happens to another student," Burns told a news conference."I have total confidence in every one of our employees because they are doing a fantastic job." The student was shot in a dorm on the north side of campus where about a dozen students live. He was found dead in an upper floor room, burned. A person of interest has been detained. He was arrested and has been charged with homicide, police said. President Burns said a student who is a "person of interest" in the case has not been allowed to see him. No details are available Sunday night."We have to determine the facts and I'm going to let the police have the first look at it," Burns said. "I don't want to jump to any conclusions" until all the evidence is complete.According to the Daily Herald, university police are conducting a criminal investigation. University president Burns described the incident as "isolated" and said "we're doing everything we can to make sure that there's no repeat of this."The incident occurred about 6:30 at night, when the university's president was walking through the dorms and passed what he described as an "uproar" on the second floor of the dorm. One of his employees reported seeing what appeared to be a gunshot at that time."We do believe this is an isolated incident until we know for certain what those people on the second floor were doing," Burns said. The university has set up a crisis hotline for students."Our people are going to do everything I can to help them deal with what's happened to each other," Burns said. At least 50 students were evacuated from the dorms during the incident, he said. It took 20 minutes for his car to reach the scene, he said. He described the scene as "desperate" and said he has no reason to believe any students are injured.President Burns said the first priority is to ensure "good health and safety for everybody	0
Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is "just about done" with the final phase of his reintegration, a military source with access to information on Bergdahl's care told CNN. He is expected to be assigned shortly to a new Army unit, the  Army War College, which he graduated from, the source said.The War College, based in cooperation with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, will offer an online course that will help soldiers develop leadership skills.The Army confirmed Wednesday that Bergdahl, who is being held as a prisoner at a U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan, had been accepted to the college.The Army said the War College, a top-ranking post with more than 500 graduates, would provide Bergdahl with "leadership development and leadership training to prepare him for military leadership," the Army said.Bergdahl, who had been serving with the 1st Battalion, 3rd  Ranger Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, was taken into custody on May 31, five days after walking away from his outpost in a  Taliban-held valley in Afghanistan.His disappearance fueled intense speculation as to whether he was either dead or still alive. But he was eventually found, wounded, in a cave in eastern Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border.The Army said Wednesday that the base where Bergdahl was being held could not be reached by phone because of a "technical issue" with the phone company that handles calls to the base.The Army says it cannot answer questions about Bergdahl's medical treatment."To discuss any medical treatment, condition or recovery for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the individual, his family or representatives, please contact your command or civilian medical provider directly," the Army said in a statement to CNN.The Army is declining to provide the exact location of the base or how Bergdahl's health was determined there.Army spokesman 1st Lt. Jeff Cherry told CNN the base was the "operational headquarters" for the 10th Mountain Division's 101st Airborne Division, which controls all outposts on the Afghan side of the border with Pakistan.The Army said the base, which the 1st Battalion, 3rd  Ranger Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division uses, was previously called Camp Stanley.He was at the base when he was taken off	0
Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide. Crowds erupted in cheers, kissed and hugged as the giant ball dropped at midnight to mark the start of 2012. "This is crazy, it's doggone warm," said Gary Grieco of College Point New York, who attended the unusually warm festivities this year. Grieco said he hopes this year is better than the last and outlined his resolutions for the New Year. "Quit smoking, that's my promise ... today is the day," he said. From London to Samoa, the world ushered in 2012 and said goodbye to a year marked by natural disasters, economic turmoil and other highlights such as the end of the Iraq war. "Natural disasters were pretty brutal and the end of the Iraq war was long overdue," Grieco said. Fireworks lit up the sky over London's River Thames as the clock struck midnight -- one of many festivities worldwide. As Big Ben chimed on midnight, the sky exploded with pyrotechnics to mark the start of what Mayor Boris Johnson promised to be "the most extraordinary and exciting year we are likely to see in our lifetime in this city." In 2012, London will host the Summer Olympics and pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee marking her 50 years on the throne. England was relatively late to the party, which began 14 hours earlier (at 5 a.m. ET) in Samoa, Tokelau and the Christmas Islands in the western Pacific. Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade. From there, the midnight revelry worked its way west. The final ones set to ring in the new year will also be in the Pacific, specifically on the U.S. Midway Islands and American Samoa. New Zealand bid farewell to a year that brought more than its share of natural disasters, with fireworks bursting through a blanket of fog to light up Auckland's Sky Tower. Dazzling pyrotechnics above Sydney Harbour got 2012 off to a spectacular start in Australia, with huge crowds gathered to watch.	1
And now the saga of the Chilean miners -- at least a part of it -- may be about to make a detour to Graceland. Which may not be as bizarre a notion as it sounds. One of the 33 miners who endured more than two months trapped underground, and who was pulled to safety last week, is a devoted fan of the late Elvis Presley. Edison Pena, 34, speaks little English, according to his father. But there is an exception; he knows all the words to most of Presley's biggest hits. It was reported that Pena led Presley singalongs down below, to lift the miners' spirits and to help pass the long and lonely hours. His dad, waiting for all those weeks near the San Jose mine in Chile, fashioned a placard promising his son that, when he emerged from the ground, he would be "bigger than Elvis." So it is that Pena, when he feels up to it, may be embarking on a journey to Memphis, Tennessee, to set foot in the house where Presley lived. The people who run Presley's Graceland mansion have invited the miner to Presley's home. If he goes, he's likely to love it -- take the word of someone who has been a serial visitor to Graceland over the years. I can tell Mr. Pena that if he thought he needed sunglasses to protect his eyes from the light near the mine opening after those months in the dimness, he might do well to bring them along to Graceland with him, too. The place is a little garish. But it's pretty great. I highly recommend that he spend time standing at the entrance to the Jungle Room, the part of Graceland that best portrays Presley's playfulness. As the story goes, he purchased all of the room's eccentric furniture during one 30-minute shopping spree at a Memphis store called Donald's. He outfitted the room with chairs bearing the carved likenesses of animal faces; he had green shag carpeting nailed to the ceiling; he ordered a constantly dripping waterfall to be constructed on one wall -- in many ways the Jungle Room is the soul of Graceland.	1
The death toll from a landslide that buried three villages in eastern Uganda stood at 18 Tuesday, and rescue officials fear the figure will rise. Another nine were injured and countless more may be missing, the Red Cross said. Heavy rains sent rocks and mud crashing down on the villages in the mountainous district of Bududa on Monday, about 275 kilometers (170 miles) northeast of the capital Kampala. At least 15 homes were destroyed, said Catherine Ntabadde of the Uganda Red Cross Society. "Last night district authorities requested all people in high risk places to move to a school that we are using as a primary camp,"  Ntabadde said Tuesday. No bodies have been recovered due to the heavy debris that has buried some of the victims 100 meters deep, Ntabadde said. Additional equipment is expected to arrive in the remote area Wednesday to assist in the excavation. Landslide kills 25 on Philippine island ravaged by rain The Red Cross is working alongside members of the Ugandan army to relocate more than 1,000 people. "People are a bit reluctant to move until an incident like this happens. People want to stay near their homes and find out what happened to their loved ones and their belongings," Ntabadde said. Torrential downpours regularly cause landslides in the eastern part of the country, particularly in areas where heavy logging has left the land stripped of vegetation. Last August, at least 23 people died when a massive landslide swallowed homes in the Bulambuli district, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Kampala. In 2010, another landslide in the same region killed at least 87. Rain, terrain slow recovery efforts after Uganda landslide	1
In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Suzy Welch, right, developed a decision-making process before marrying former GE CEO Jack Welch. The business writer, whose work appears in BusinessWeek and O: The Oprah Magazine, spoke with CNN about whether her method could have prevented the financial crisis, what Oprah would think of her mistrust of gut reactions and how to avoid becoming a cliché from a Talking Heads song. An excerpted version of that interview is below: CNN: Could you start off by explaining what 10-10-10 means? Welch: It's a way of infusing intentionality and deliberateness into your decision making so you are living your life instead of your life living you. It impels you to do a values excavation, where you have a very candid conversation about what really matters to you: who you are, who you want to be. Then you take each decision -- each messy decision, each complicated decision; it's not about "Where do we go to dinner?" -- and you consider the consequences of your options in the immediate future, 10 minutes, in the foreseeable future -- that's the 10 months -- and then the distant future -- that's the 10 years. CNN: How does that compare with other decision-making methods, say, like, going with your gut reaction or flipping a coin? Welch: Gut's got its moment. There's a story in the book about when gut saved my life. I think gut is no way to live your life. Gut is a not-transparent, relatively inconsistent method for building a life of your own making. Now, the problem with gut is that good decision-makers are made, not born. If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind. So, paralysis in moments of fear. The sort of selective deafness we have: only listening to people that we like. Not breaking from the group. There are hardwired neurological responses that always the best decision options.	1
Poet, dramatist and novelist, Wole Soyinka's work has left a large imprint on the literary landscape of Africa. Poltical activist and Nobel Laureat, Wole Soyinka. His work has been performed internationally and in 1986 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Regardless of the global profile and recognition, writing for Soyinka has always been, and always will be, a part of his life. "I began writing early, very, very early. ... I was already writing short stories for the radio, and selling poems to poetry and art festivals, I was involved in school plays, I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, now I'm a writer. I've always been a writer," he told CNN. Before being honored with a Nobel Prize, Soyinka had written plays performed across the world, set up drama groups and held academic positions in the UK, the U.S. and Nigeria. Poetry and novels make up the rest of his work, but it is with the medium of drama that he feels most comfortable. "When I write plays, I'm already seeing the shapes on stage, of the actors and their interaction, and so on and so forth. I don't think I've ever written one play as an abstract piece, as a literary piece, floating in the air somewhere, to be flushed out later on," he said. Now 75, Soyinka claims it is a natural curiosity with life and humanity that has always compelled him to write, and should be a pre-requisite for all aspiring writers. "Before you're a writer, you're a citizen, a human being, and therefore the weapons of the citizen are at your disposal to use, or not use," he said. Often he's used those "weapons" to take aim at oppression, corruption, the legacy of colonialism and slavery, both in his work and more overtly in his political activism. At times he's suffered for his outspoken views; in 1967 he was imprisoned for 22 months for publicly calling for a truce during Nigeria's civil war and in 1994 was forced to leave the country when General Sani Abacha came to power. "One of my earliest short stories in fact had to do with the story of a family which escaped enslavement by Portuguese slave leaders, so you can see how early I was preoccupied by that theme of power and freedom, and domination," he said.	1
It was after the robotic hummingbird flew around the auditorium -- and after a speaker talked about the hypersonic plane that could fly from New York to the West Coast in 11 minutes -- that things got really edgy. Vijay  Singh, a member of the board of trustees of the University of Texas, stood up and declared, "I'd like to hear a word from Dr. Wooten, the university's president." When Mr. Wooten didn't respond, Singh pointed her finger at the speaker and shouted, "He never answers! He's a coward!" The hall, filled with faculty and students, erupted into jubilation. The chair of the board of trustees, the Rev. Daniel Branson, asked Singh to take her seat and issue a public apology. Singh refused. She said that "if the chairman of the board of trustees wishes to apologize, let him." The crowd exploded with laughter. When Singh got up to leave, she heard a voice shouting that she should be "ashamed" of herself. But Singh said she didn't care. "I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time," she said. "That's the way Texans like things done."Singh's comments to a packed auditorium in February 1993, in which she blasted the University of Texas for "wasting" money on a "gutted dinosaur" and called Dr. Wooten's handling of the university a "tragedy," won a place in the annals of "Texas Tea Party" history. Her comments also highlighted the fact that at the University of Texas, anger was a kind of drug. Even for political candidates, it was a common occurrence to be attacked in a place where political opponents were almost guaranteed. The fact that the University of Texas had been in good standing and had not been in for many years made it more likely that Singh would get her comeuppance.For a time, Singh was the most visible figure in the Tea Party. She was an outspoken supporter of the Reagan administration and of "law and order" -- a stance unpopular with the state's growing Latino population, and in fact a position held by many Latinos in the Rio Grande Valley. She frequently appeared on the conservative talk shows, "Crossfire" and "Crossing Jordan," to spout her views, which were often inflammatory -- "they were like an acid that was put in our water," she once said	0
Four U.S. soldiers have been charged with cruelty and maltreatment of four subordinates in Iraq after a suicide investigation brought to light alleged wrongdoing, the military said Friday. There is no confirmed evidence that the suicide, which involved a fifth subordinate in the unit, was a result of any mistreatment, said Lt. Col. Kevin Olson, a spokesman for Multi-National Division-South, who said the military is looking into that possibility. Charges were brought Wednesday against three sergeants and a specialist with the 13th Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Bliss, Texas, accusing them of engaging in "verbal abuse, physical punishment and ridicule of subordinates," according to Olson. He described the physical punishment as falling into the category of "undue calisthenics." "Accusations of cruelty and maltreatment are taken very seriously, and we will investigate this isolated incident thoroughly," said Brig. Gen. David Elicerio, deputy commanding general for Multi-National Division-South. Olson said the Army does not believe the maltreatment of subordinates went beyond the soldiers' unit. The four were identified as: All four soldiers have been removed from their unit. Olson said Army officials have spoken to the four subordinate soldiers and are offering them any help they need. The suicide investigation began on August 4, Olson said. On that day, a Defense Department news release said that Pvt. Keiffer P. Wilhelm, 19, of Plymouth, Ohio, died in Iraq of injuries sustained from a noncombat-related incident. He was assigned to a unit from the 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss, the release said.	1
Singer Chris Brown pleaded not guilty to both charges in the felony assault case against him Monday afternoon. Singer Chris Brown, right, appeared in court Monday on charges of assaulting singer Rihanna. Singer Rihanna, Â Left, also attended the hearing, and, from left, were Brownâs brother, Rihannaâs stepmother and Brownâs ex-girlfriend, Tamar Braxton. Their trial was scheduled to begin Monday morning. Photos / Getty ImagesBrown was expected to be charged with four misdemeanor counts of simple assault, stemming from the April 2 incident in which he allegedly spat on Rihanna and threw an egg at her.Also charged in the case is Brownâs former girlfriend, Rihannaâs aunt, Tamar Braxton, the coupleâs former manager and Brownâs brother, who is also Brownâs manager and ex-boyfriend and the brother of Rihannaâs mother. Their trial began in the afternoon, with Brown pleading not guilty to all four charges. Brown is looking to have the charges against him reduced to felonies, if he can persuade a judge as to how they are connected to the incident.Rihannaâs publicist, Patrick Grady, said his client was âpleased because she was able to get more time to prepare to be able to talk to her family and friends about what unfolded that night.ââI think itâs going to be a good thing for the family,â he said.During the hearing, Brown's attorney entered the plea of ânot guiltyâ to the four charges.

Sanctions. International monitors. Increased jet fighters in the region. Trying to figure out how the United States and its European allies will respond to Russia's Crimea incursion gets confusing. The tense showdown over Ukrainian sovereignty offers few easy answers,  though a little research can help make the picture clearer.What's clearer is that there is a major disconnect between what U.S. officials and commentators say they want and the reality on the ground in the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine. As Putin approaches the United States for his first summit with President Barack Obama, it's unclear how realistic their goal of creating a new, more cooperative relationship with Russia will be.A diplomatic breakthrough may be just what Putin needs. There are few other players in the region with whom he needs to reach an accommodation, and that includes the Obama administration, which is unlikely to push him toward Russia's side of any decision to go to war.Putin's next big test might only come when European nations like the United States and the European Union, along with the United Nations and major Western allies, start to push for a new sanctions regime in response to Russia's behavior, and as a way of containing Putin's aggression.Such a move would force Russia to respond and would be a major blow to Putin's already questionable plans.For now, Putin has little choice but to walk into talks with the United States with an open mind. He may come away thinking that the United States is willing to give him an opportunity to do the things he needs to do to create the kind of positive, cooperative relationship that he and Obama seem to have been missing since last summer. It also means that Putin might find himself in a position where he is ready to make concessions to the United States and the West that could shape their relationship for years to come. But it means he has little interest in playing a role in a diplomatic effort that would lead to the imposition of sanctions on Russia.Russia's next big test might only come when European nations like the United States and the European Union, along with the United Nations and major Western allies, start to push for a new sanctions regime in response to Russia's behavior, and as a way of containing Putin's aggression.Such a move would force Russia to respond and would be a major blow to Putin's already questionable plans.For now, Putin has little choice but to walk into talks with the United States with an open mind	0
There's no doubt that Iran's election will be a major test for incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But many Iranian women hope the results will also shake the current status of women in the Islamic republic. Zahra Rahnavard, wife of Iranian candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, has taken a visible role in the campaign. "Thirty-four million women demand to have female Cabinet ministers; 34 million women demand to be eligible to run for president," Zahra Rahnavard, wife of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "Thirty-four million women want the civil law to be revised; 34 million women want the family law revised." Whether her husband wins or loses Friday, Rahnavard has broken barriers for women just by appearing on the campaign trail with her husband, a rarity for political wives in Iran. "We look at her, and we say, 'We want to be like her in the future,' " said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, an Iranian woman who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium along with nearly 12,000 others to hear Rahnavard speak in March. Rahnavard is a mother of three, as well as an accomplished artist and academic. She has been compared to first ladies in the United States, including Michelle Obama, for her visible role in her husband's quest for the presidency. "I am here to say that men and women are equal," Rahnavard said. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins. "We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it," she said. Iranian women remain second-class citizens in criminal matters, divorce, child custody and inheritance cases, despite making up 65 percent of university students. Ahmadinejad's fundamentalist government has tried to make it easier for men to take more than one wife while restricting public sector careers for women.	1
A meningitis outbreak is threatening the lives of tens of thousands of people in Darfur, according to an aid agency expelled from the country last week. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. Humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western Darfur against meningitis, when it was told to leave the country. "We were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign. At the moment  there's no one there that can take over those activities, which is really worrying," Gemma Davies of MSF told CNN. The country's Ministry of Health officially declared a meningitis outbreak on March 2 at the Kalma Camp, which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern Darfur. "Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN. "With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning," she added. The vaccination campaign was due to begin on March 7, but it is now unclear if or when it will resume, as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue. Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations. "We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled," she said. "We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return." Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week. So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases. Thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout Sudan. "One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there," Davies added. The medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic.	1
Delayed, but a go. That's what "Fast & Furious" actor Vin Diesel told fans Sunday night about the franchise's seventh installment. He posted a message and photograph on Facebook that showed the last scene he and Paul Walker filmed together. "There was a unique sense of completion, of pride we shared... in the film we were now completing... the magic captured... and, in just how far we've come...," Diesel wrote, announcing a new release date for the film -- April 10, 2015. "P.s. He'd want you to know first...," he said. The movie had been scheduled for a July 2014 release, but production was put on hold following Walker's sudden death. Walker, 40, and the rest of the "Fast & Furious" cast were on a short break for Thanksgiving when he stepped into a red 2005 Porsche Carerra GT for a short ride around a Santa Clarita, California, business park. Investigators believe the car, driven by Walker's friend, was speeding when it clipped a light pole and was engulfed in flames, killing both men. Walker's ex-cop character, Brian O'Conner, was central to five of the first six "Fast & Furious" stories, and his death left the future of the next film in doubt. Millions of dollars are at stake, considering the franchise has sold $2.6 billion in tickets around the world since 2001. CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.	1
A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport reopened Friday morning, a day after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay. Runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar. It reopened at 10:30 a.m. ET Friday, according to Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Delta plane slid off the runway Thursday morning, with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters. Delta Flight 1086 briefly circled New York due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday, passenger Jared Faellaci told CNN. Almost as soon as it did, those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft's wheels seemed to have little to no traction, sliding for about 20 seconds. "You didn't feel the wheels take," Faellaci said. Then it was a matter of "where we are going to end up," he said. About 4,500 to 5,000 feet down Runway 13, the MD-88 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment. A little farther, and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in Flushing Bay rather than on the airport's snow-covered ground. Contrary to what Delta said in a statement, the aircraft's slides did not deploy, according to Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. Still, with help from first responders, everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to LaGuardia's Delta terminal. Video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area. Twenty-four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening. Three of those were transported to nearby hospitals, the New York City Fire Department tweeted. Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse. "It was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection, as people were scared," he said. "The pilot did a phenomenal job." The plane left a relatively balmy Atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later.	1
Ryan Alexander Jenkins, a reality TV contestant suspected in his wife's slaying, was found hanging from a coat rack in a motel room in an apparent suicide, according to Canadian officials. Police were hunting for Ryan Alexander Jenkins Â as a person of interest in the slaying.Jenkins, 27, appeared in the "America's Next Top Model" Season 10 finale as a finalist, along with a number of other new cast members, this past May. His wife, 26-year-old model, Brittany Dawn, was found dead in the couple's Los Angeles home three days later. Jenkins was arrested four days after the slaying, and is suspected of her murder.The Washington Post's Carol D. Leonnig reports on Thursday that when authorities in the United Kingdom asked her agency to hand over Ryan Jenkins, they had no luck.But officials did get a phone number.They did so by posing for a photograph with Jenkins, according to an agency official who spoke to Leonnig.The British police were tipped off by an American law enforcement source to contact them, she said. Officials in London made a formal request for Ryan Jenkins' phone number, and the response was a positive one, said a United Kingdom law enforcement official, speaking with Leonnig.Jenkins, who is also known as Ryan Alexander, or Ryan Alexander Jenkins, was among the contestants eliminated from "America's Next Top Model." This photo shows the model's headless body in a bathtub on Wednesday, July 3, 2009.Ryan Jenkins of Oklahoma posted a picture of Brittany Dawn's body to his Facebook page in March. He had just gone to a high school reunion, leaving that afternoon, according to a friend of Brittany's who told the Tulsa World. The friend, who asked not to be identified, said Jenkins called her by cellphone around 5 p.m. from a pay phone at an Oklahoma gas station. He told her, "I'm sorry, I shot my wife because I wanted her to live," she said.Jenkins wrote: "If you are reading this, I wanted to let you know that I did not kill Brittany D. That just isn't true ... The girl in the picture is my wife, and I did NOT shoot her. I didn't say I did. I'm sorry, I'm sorry ....."Ryan was in the process of being divorced from Brittany, and he had	0
An Egyptian court has ruled that Hamas is a terrorist organization, according to an Egyptian state-run media organization. Hamas, the Islamist group which dominates the Gaza strip, has been at odds with the Egyptian government since the country's former President, Mohammed Morsy, was ousted in a coup in the summer of 2013. Morsy was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization that shares deep ties with Hamas. The government formed after Morsy's ouster designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist group in December 2013; since then, many of its leaders have been charged with supporting terrorism. Hamas quickly denounced the decision at a news conference. "It is a shocking and dangerous decision that targets the Palestinian people," Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said at a news conference. "It will directly contaminate the reputation of Egypt." CNN has attempted to reach Mousa Abu Marzouk, the Hamas representative in Egypt, for comment. For years Egypt has played a major role in peace negotiations between Israel and various Palestinian factions, with Egypt being seen as fairly impartial by both sides. It's possible the new ruling will affect Egypt's position as a mediator between the two sides. The United States and European Union have both designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. Egypt's Urgent Matters Court based its ruling on Hamas in part on claims the organization had supported insurgents who have staged attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, a region that has been fraught with instability in recent months. The armed wing of Hamas, the al Qassam Brigades, was designated a terror group by the same court last month. This ruling comes a week after Egypt passed the Terrorist Entities Law, which spells out how to declare a group a terrorist organization, according to Ahmed Ragheb, head of the National Group for Human Rights and Law. That new law states that the prosecutor general has to propose declaring a terrorist organization; that decision has to approved by the appeals court, Ragheb said. That means the court that made the decision did not have authority to do so. Typically, foreign policy decisions in Egypt are left to the executive branch of government. Under the law, authorities can also issue travel bans and freeze the assets of terror designees. CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and journalist Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.	1
India approved a distinct symbol for its currency, the rupee, Thursday, joining the league of currencies identifiable by their unique signs. Up to this point, the Indian rupee has been denoted by "Rs" or the abbreviation INR. The new symbol, which looks like an R in Hindi, with an intersecting horizontal line, was selected after a public contest involving 3,000 designs, Ambika Soni, India's information and broadcasting minister, said. The move to give to its currency a new recognition stems from the country's economic growth, the minister said. "The symbol for the rupee would lend a distinctive character and identity to the currency and further highlight the strength and robustness of the Indian economy as also a favored destination for global investments," Soni said. She also noted that the symbol would help distinguish the Indian rupee from the namesake currencies of several other nations like Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Apart from citing her country's rapid integration with the global economy as a reason for adopting a symbol for the Indian rupee, Soni also noted the cultural importance to the new currency, because of its resemblance to Hindi's R. The symbol "reflects and captures the Indian ethos and culture," she said. One of the world's few growth markets after the global recession, India expects its gross domestic product to grown 8.5 percent in 2010-11, despite being faced with a consolidated fiscal deficit of 8.4 percent.	1
France's first lady is filing a defamation complaint against the authors of a biography published Thursday which claims she had an affair with a former French minister while seeing President Francois Hollande. Attorneys for Valérie Trierweiler, who is not married to Hollande, told CNN the complaint is likely to be filed Friday with the Paris tribunal. Read more: Can France handle truth on sex lives of rich and powerful? In "La Frondeuse," or "The Troublemaker," authors Alix Bouilhaguet and Christophe Jakubyszyn allege that Trierweiler had a longstanding relationship with Patrick Devedjian, a former minister for economic recovery and close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy. This relationship allegedly started in 1998 and ended only in 2004 -- four years after her courtship with Hollande began. All of them had other partners at the time. Trierweiler's relationship with Devedjian crumbled after he was unable to commit further to their relationship, the book says -- paving the way for Hollande to step in. Several books have been published about Hollande and his romantic partners since he was elected. Profile: Francois Hollande "Trierweiler is an interesting subject matter because she has character," Bouilhaguet told CNN. "It's complicated for a 47-year-old woman to find herself in the Elysée, which has demanding protocol for their first ladies." Bouilhaguet admitted that she was "surprised" by the defamation complaint, adding that the book is an "open investigation with a true look" at Trierweiler's personality. In another extract in the book, the authors write that Trierweiler claims Sarkozy made a pass at her at a July 14 celebration in the Elysée Palace, while holding his ex-wife Cecilia's hand. "You're so beautiful," he is said to have whispered in her ear. When she refused his advances, the book says, Sarkozy said to his friends: "Who does she take herself for? Am I not good enough for her?" Trierweiler is characterized by this "abrupt iciness," the authors claim, and inside journalist circles at French newspaper Le Monde, she was labeled "Cruella." A friend of the couple goes even further and says in the book that Trierweiler is the "Achilles heel" of Hollande, who can "potentially create a lot of problems for him."	1
U.S. gasoline prices have declined for four weeks straight and now average more than 20 cents a gallon cheaper than a year ago, according to a new nationwide survey. The average cost of a gallon across the continental United States of regular stands at $3.71, down 3 cents from two weeks earlier, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. Prices have fallen nearly 9 cents a gallon in the past four weeks and are 22 cents cheaper than at this point in 2012, Lundberg said. Lower prices in the Europe's benchmark Brent crude oil are largely behind the most recent fall. More U.S. refining capacity coming back on line after seasonal maintenance also contributed, Lundberg said. "From there, short-term, we may see more price-cutting soon, perhaps on the order of this approximate 3-cent decline," she said. "But the current picture suggests it won't be large." Gas prices broke a three-month upward spiral in early March, which had climbed nearly 54 cents since late December. The Lundberg Survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations across the Lower 48 states every two weeks. The most expensive fuel in the latest survey, conducted Friday, was in Chicago, where pump prices averaged $4.10 a gallon; the cheapest could be found in Billings, Montana, at $3.33, Lundberg said. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: Atlanta: $3.57 Baton Rouge, Louisiana: $3.45 Boston: $3.75 Denver: $3.53 Las Vegas: $3.72 Memphis, Tennessee: $3.43 Miami: $3.74 Philadelphia: $3.64 San Francisco: $4.07 Seattle: $3.81 CNNMoney: California could be next oil boom state	1

Nearly 65 years after his demise by his own hand in a bunker beneath the streets of Berlin, Adolf Hitler is still managing to cause controversy. The latest dispute has pitched U.S. researchers against the ersatz Nazi leader.In a little-noticed article published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the author, Dr. Joseph S. Nierenberg, said he was “very concerned that we are not taking all the proper steps to ensure that Adolf Hitler is not used as a political tool to further political agendas.”A prominent conservative who once served as a medical adviser to Ronald Reagan, Nierenberg is, in fact, a prominent German researcher in the field of genetics, who is working with German researchers to advance the field of genetics related to diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s.Nierenberg has no connection to the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that deals with medical research. But the timing of this comment was not accidental.On July 17, Nierenberg received a tweet from German media outlet Spiegel Online, informing him that he had been selected by the University of Bordeaux to serve as a special advisor on the development of a “Hitler vaccine.”This news came just weeks after a German geneticist, Rainer Bock, announced he was retiring from a German pharmaceutical company after he discovered that the company’s experimental Alzheimer’s vaccine had caused a rare disease called “neurofibrillary tangle.”The tweet from Spiegel’s account stated that “Nierenberg is an internationally renowned expert in genetic diseases, who serves as a professor of genetics at the University of Bordeaux.”According to the Twitter account of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, Nierenberg is not part of the NIH. Rather, his contributions to U.S. medical research stem from his work at the German Institute for Neuro-Bioethics (iNVH) at the University of Bordeaux.Bock’s discovery, which came after over 20 years of research on Alzheimer’s, was published in the journal, Current Opinion in Neurobiology.“Since I first read the results [from Bock’s research],	0
Gunmen fired on a children's aid group in Pakistan's tribal region Monday, leaving three staffers dead and at least one critically injured, the organization said. Pakistani paramilitary soldiers patrol in Quetta, the Balochistan capital. And earlier Monday a suicide bomber struck Pakistan's military headquarters in Rawalpindi Monday, killing at least eight people, including the army's top ranking medical officer and himself, military officials said. Lt. Gen. Mushtaq Ahmed Baig, the army surgeon-general, was among those killed in the blast in Rawalpindi, the officials said. The non-governmental organization, Plan, said that at around 4:15 p.m. up to a dozen men carrying guns and grenades entered the office in Mansehra, in the North West Frontier Province -- Pakistan's lawless tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The gunmen began firing and detonated three explosive devices. Video from the scene showed the building engulfed in smoke and flames as staffers tried to escape from windows. Others were carried out by hand or on stretchers. The fire destroyed the building. Plan's chief executive, Tom Miller, said the office immediately shut down as security teams looked into the incident. "Our primary concern is for our staff and the families of those hurt in the attack," Miller said in a written statement. The motive for the attack remains under investigation. Officials were not aware of any prior threats to the office, Plan spokesman Jon Slater told CNN. Slater said 21 full-time and seven part-time employees work at the office, though it's unclear how many were present at the time of the attack. Most of the employees are locals. Plan, which helps Pakistani communities provide education and other opportunities to children, has had a presence in the region for more than a decade. The group says it was deeply involved in the relief effort following a major earthquake in 2005 that left nearly 3 million people homeless. At least 20 others were wounded in the Rawalpindi suicide bombing which happened along Mall Road, a heavily traveled thoroughfare in Rawalpindi, according to Pakistani officials.  Watch the aftermath of the suicide bombing » The government promoted Baig to lieutenant general last January and he assumed his role as army surgeon-general the following month, according to a news release at the time. Baig, who graduated from a Lahore medical college, was an ophthalmologist.	1
You know things in Chicago are bad when 70 murders in the first quarter can be seen as a good thing. But context is everything: Last year at this time there had been more than 120 murders, so I guess we should thank God for small favors. It seems inconceivable that the city President Barack Obama calls home is also the city where his family may be least safe. Just this Monday a 15-year-old boy was found shot dead in a backyard only four blocks from the president's house. What's responsible for the bloodshed? Gang violence, as usual. Police estimate that of the 532 murders in 2012 -- nearly 1.5 a day -- about 80 percent were gang related. And yet, despite that rather staggering statistic, the national outcry is muted at best -- nothing, to say the least, like the kind we saw last week in Boston. What is it about the word "gang" that brings out the apathy in us? Would we view Chicago differently if we called the perpetrators something else? In Chicago, nurses dodge bullets to provide care I'm not saying the people of Boston do not deserve our sympathy; they do. Nor am I suggesting the apprehension of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not essential. But how do we explain our habit of greeting terrorists with 24-hour news coverage and relentless wrath while overlooking the gangs that terrorize our streets daily -- as if terrorism were only an enemy state and not a concept. The murder numbers may be slightly better in Chicago, but they do not fully communicate the city's state of siege. In February CNN reported that some children living in gang-ridden parts of the city carry guns because, to them, getting caught and serving time for possession of a gun is better than getting caught without one and dying. Last month, city officials announced the closure of 54 "under-resourced" schools, which will force some kids to walk across warring gang territory to get to school. For example, in the seven blocks between George Manierre Elementary and Jenner Elementary there are three gangs fighting over territory: Black P Stones, Conservative Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples. Kids and guns: 'These are not isolated tragedies' If it all sounds scary, it's only because it is.	1
Have you looked at the Middle East lately? It's a giant mess, with civil wars, massive popular protests, cross-border fighting, armed insurgencies, exploding car bombs and on and on. And that's just in the past few days. Â What's happening there is a major, major security crisis. This is a dangerous place to be, and we must do everything within our power to try to prevent the worst from happening to our civilian and military people.Let's face facts: the war is not going well.What's more, the situation in Iraq is likely to get worse. After all, the country is being torn apart, while Iran is being airdropped across the border. And the fighting just seems to be accelerating. The Talibanâ€™s resurgence is on everyone's mind. They've gone from a relatively peaceful regime to an aggressive Islamist warlord state.How can we possibly pull this off? And have peace and security be maintained in the Middle East? The answer, of course, is that we can't. We have to fight this war. We will. We just have to find some way to keep the war going for a little while longer.There's some evidence that we're already down to the wire: yesterday, we learned that the United States is in the process of withdrawing its combat troops from Iraq. It will be a complete pullout in 15 days. But what does that mean?First, and sadly, for our soldiers, it will mean losing all contact with their country of birth, which is almost certainly going to be very sad for them. It's going to be a difficult situation for anyone, but especially so for young men who have just finished an intense and grueling six- or six-and-a-half-year term of service. But, fortunately, our people will just have to get used to it. We're moving them on to a more secure location, where they won't be in the line of fire.Second, and perhaps more importantly, it will mean moving a lot of highly-paid soldiers out of the war zone. The Army has a policy of not using any money to keep or transport soldiers, no matter how crucial. That's why, when our troops are deployed, we send them out to the provinces, in the most remote corners of the world. So we won't have any problem if they leave the war zone	0
Juventus have sacked coach Ciro Ferrara after a string of poor results and have installed Alberto Zaccheroni in the hot seat until the end of the season. Ferrara's position has been threatened after a dismal run which has seen them slip out of contention in the Serie A title race as well as being eliminated from the Champions League at the group stages. Thursday's 2-1 Coppa Italia defeat to Italian champions Inter Milan proved the final straw and the club released a statement to confirm his departure and Zaccheroni's arrival. "Zaccheroni will take over the team immediately and will guide this afternoon's training session in Vinovo before being officially unveiled to the media," it read. Ferrara joined Juve late last season and steered the Turin powerhouses to second place in Serie A behind Inter. But his first full campaign in charge proved challenging after a promising start to the season. The Bianconeri have lost five of their last six games in Serie A and have slumped to sixth in the standings, four points behind Napoli, who hold the last Champions League qualifying spot. Zaccheroni will hope to get them on track with his first game against Lazio on Sunday. The 56-year-old has coached at a number of leading Serie A clubs and helped AC Milan to the 1999 Italian title, but it is his first job since being sacked by Torino in February 2007. Ferrara, a former Italy international and Juventus defender, was given the reins despite his lack of experience, succeeding current Roma coach Claudio Ranieri, who was fired. Zaccheroni's appointment ends, for now, media speculation that Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez would take charge at Juve, but the short-term nature of his contract until June raises questions about the permanence of his stay. Benitez acknowledged the speculation in his weekly press conference on Friday. "I am focused on preparing my team for the game against Bolton. I know they (Juventus) were interested, that is part of the game now in football, but I am not ready to talk too much because I don't want to lose my focus. "When you are a manager and you have clubs asking (for you), you have to be proud because they are a top side in Europe, but I am really happy here and want to do my job as best I can."	1
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg found himself facing questions Thursday about why the city was paying for more than 100 vacant hotel rooms when thousands were displaced after Superstorm Sandy. The rooms were reserved for storm victims who were pushed out of their homes by Sandy, which hit the area October 29. According to Bloomberg's office, a total of 1,014 people were housed in 416 rooms, while another 120 rooms designated as emergency housing were vacant. "We've gone out and we've gotten housing for people in case they might need it, but the wonderful thing is we haven't needed it so far," Bloomberg said Thursday. "We have hotel rooms in advance, particularly now because as you get toward the holiday season the hotel occupancy goes up, and if we need it -- and I hope we don't -- we're going to have those," he added. That's a surprise to Nicole Neal, whose whose apartment in the Queens neighborhood of Far Rockaway hasn't had heat or power since the storm hit. "I would go to the hotel," Neal told CNN on Thursday. "It's freezing in my apartment. I got to wear four pairs of socks every day." Yisroel Schulman, president of the New York Legal Assistance Group, said scores of families are staying in cold, dark homes because they are concerned about looting or they don't want to pull their children from school. "We believe strongly the minute that first snow hits, and it's really cold, these people are going to need housing," Schulman said. "It's a very prudent move on apart of the city to have as much temporary housing as possible." The city says canvassers have knocked on more than 12,600 doors to tell people that housing assistance is available for those who still lack heat, and they leave flyers on the doors of units where no one answers. Residents are being told about restoration centers where they can be connected with hotels if their heat is still out. Sandy victims outraged over business-as-usual power bills Neal said she had not been contacted about the available hotel rooms. She has been staying with her mother in a crowded Brooklyn apartment while she awaits repairs to her apartment, where she said the walls are caving in and mold is growing on the walls. She said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has given her $1,700 and that the city took over responsibility for the housing complex she lived in because the landlord abandoned it.	1
Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen have kept their places in the rebranded Team Lotus line-up for the 2011 Formula One season. Italian Trulli and Finn Kovalainen were the line-up for Lotus Racing last season as a team bearing the name of the famous marque returned to the world championship for the first time since 1994. The 36-year-old Trulli is preparing for his 15th season in F1, racing for six different teams, winning his only grand prix in Monaco in 2004 with Renault. Former McLaren star Kovalainen claimed the new team's best result in 2011 when he finished 12th in Japan, but suffered a heavy crash in Sunday's Race of Champions. He was knocked unconscious and he wrote on his Twitter blog: "I've been put to bed-rest at home as a precaution, heavy concussion, further tests in the next few days as head took a big hit." The Team Lotus, who are sponsored by CNN, line-up was confirmed as the sports's governing body, the FIA, released the provisional drivers' list for the 2011 season. Force India, Toro Rosso, Hispania and the renamed Marussia Virgin Racing have yet to confirm their driver line-ups. Williams announced Tuesday that Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado has been drafted in to drive alongside Rubens Barrichello, although he is not included on the initial list. He would replace German Nico Hulkenberg, whose contract was not renewed. Renault have named only Robert Kubica after Russian Vitaly Petrov's seat was placed into question after an inconsistent first season. The leading teams of Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari have, as expected, unchanged line-ups. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel claimed the 2010 world title and paired with Mark Webber to help the team win the constructors' crown.	1
Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $1 million or more, a higher threshold than the $250,000 dividing  most taxpayers into two groups — those who make more and those who make less. The increase in taxes only on the wealthy would have cost $8.4 billion in additional general revenue, the exact same as what was raised by the same legislation in 2009 and 2010. And on the $250,000 cutoff, the tax increase would have been more than a third as large as in the previous two years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Now, after years of failed economic theories, the authors have a plan that will actually reduce the deficit and raise more. The authors are a panel of top economic policy specialists who met for a three-part session April 22 and 23 to discuss a new, more realistic way to control the deficit.At the end of the meeting, the committee agreed how much it would take in taxes to pay off the deficit by the year 2035, and they agreed on how much revenue would be raised by that total tax increase, a rough number of $918 billion."We do think this is the best one in the bunch, and it gives the sense that we’re taking an honest look," Peter Fisher and Michael Pritikin, top economists on the panel, told NPR. The proposal is also the result of years of work by a number of economists, including Fisher, Pritikin and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman of Princeton University.The goal of the new tax proposal is to help fund the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies and to shore up defense spending to pay for more troops in Afghanistan. The authors said they would also continue to fight for increased taxes on the wealthy — and for increasing them over time."My first instinct after seeing this is that it’s a pretty good deal," former Clinton administration official Dan Kahan told NPR.The proposal could help balance the budget by 2029 if the tax increases are raised slowly — say, by a 1 percentage point every five years — and then phased out over the next 20 years. The idea is that, once the wealthy have paid the full 20-year tax on their assets, they will be on a path to retirement without incurring	0
On Tuesday night's "Larry King Live," guest host Joy Behar talked about whether the Rihanna/Chris Brown case sends a dangerous message. Robin Givens told Joy Behar Tuesday night that details of domestic  violence should be considered a death sentence. Joy Behar disagreed.JOY BEHAR: The Rihanna case is fascinating. But I'm not sure it sends a dangerous message. Because we've seen before, people don't want to talk about what happens in their marriage.The Rihanna case is fascinating because it's the first time someone in our country who was a victim of domestic violence has gone to trial and has gotten a plea bargain, and she ended up with not only probation and a fine, but she was ordered to undergo domestic violence counseling.So there's no question that there would have been a different outcome if this had happened in, say, a conservative state or a socially conservative state.There's no question that the woman who committed this domestic violence crime should have been punished. But let's not forget this was a woman who has always had an ability to talk her way out of things.Robin Givens, NBC News, Washington, D.C.Robin Givens told The Guardian last week that it's a shame this young woman was able to talk her way out of jail. "But I'm hopeful that she will be able to turn her life around," Givens said, "and that she will use her time in jail as a chance to think about her own choices."Robin Givens said, "If someone is willing to talk, you don't have to punish her."KING: That's important to me. Joy, I love being able to talk to people with ideas about the problems we have. And in this case, people are talking about the idea that she was willing to talk her way out of jail. That's a very different way of looking at it.BEHAR: What I'm also trying to say in my own words here, Joy, is that if she had been punished, it would have set the example and made it known that it's not right to talk your way out of things.[...]BEHAR: We know, as we say in the book, you can talk your way out of things, but when the victim chooses to do it, it's another	0
Meeting planner Gail Murphy heard about the travel warning to Mexico too late in the day on Monday to do anything about her plans to head to Cancun the following day. Alberto Morales wore a mask on his flight from Mexico City to Denver, Colorado, on Monday. "I'm in good health," said Murphy, who is heading to the Eighth Annual Mexico Showcase and Travel Expo from her home in Shelburne, Vermont. "I'm a risk taker, so I'll go anyway." In light of the swine flu, the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning against any non-essential travel to Mexico. The move could potentially devastate an already struggling tourism industry in the country. The World Health Organization urged countries not to restrict international travel or close borders, as such measures would not in themselves stem the outbreak. Efforts to contain the outbreak by restricting travel would be unlikely to work without "draconian measures," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general. But he said people who are ill should put off trips abroad, and people who fall ill after a trip should see a doctor. Mexico is the epicenter for the swine influenza virus outbreak. More than 100 deaths in Mexico are being investigated as possibly tied to the outbreak. The WHO confirmed 73 cases of swine flu Monday, but health officials in Scotland, California and Texas confirmed nine more, bringing the worldwide total to 82. Reports of the illness in Mexico couldn't have come at a worse time for the country's tourism industry, which is already grappling with negative publicity about drug-cartel fueled violence. "They were having a terrible time anyway with all of the problems on the border and now to be hit with this, too," said Barbara Nassau, owner of New York-based In House Travel Solutions. She added that the outbreak has the potential to hamper travel similar to the way it was affected when bird flu hit China. iReporter Dyana Pari Nafissi works in international business development in Mexico City and said tourism in the country had already been dealt a blow by fears of violence. iReport.com: Watch Dyana discuss what's happening in Mexico	1
Turkey is positioned as the geographic, economic and political bridge straddling both Asia and Europe. How Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan performs if he secures a first round victory in Sunday's Presidential election will determine if this ills-be-healed nation crosses this vital boundary and connects into the new EU, writes John Hockenhull.With more than 50 million viewers at last count, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has performed more than any other Turkish politician to bring a halt to a brutal insurgency in the country's south. He has become the most compelling symbol the struggle of his people. In doing so, he has brought greater legitimacy for his nation and secured Turkish national interest.How Prime Minister Erdogan fulfils the promise of opening up Turkey's political life to the rest of Europe cannot be seen through the prism of the past. The first step toward this goal is to define Turkey's political scene today.Turkey today is not the same country it was when the so-called Gezi Park protesters were jailed for demonstrating against the government's land use plans. But it is the same country as it was four years ago, when Mr Erdogan was first elected as prime minister.He had already established himself as a great leader and had made some impressive moves to transform Turkey's economy. In 2001 the country had been the world's 14th largest economy and was on its way to become the world's 9th largest. Turkey's population had grown and a number of its foreign businesses were prospering.When the AKP took power in 2002 Mr Erdogan had the support of his Muslim constituency and the Kurdish minority. A number of important reforms were taking place in the country during his first term. He took on the task of opening up Turkish economy to the world and was able to do so. Under his leadership, Turkey's investment in FDI from the rest of the world skyrocketed from $6bn in the first year of his government to $120bn in 2004.After his third term in 2007, Mr Erdogan had the momentum on his side in terms of stability in the country when he came within a whisker of being elected president. But the challenge for Mr Erdogan and his party to bring Turkey across Europe is much greater today than it was four years ago because his party, which is no longer his own party, is a minority in parliament.Mr Erdogan's party, the CHP, has formed a government. But,	0
The international community is now waiting for confirmation from the United States and South Korea on whether a seismic disturbance in North Korea Tuesday is in fact the hermit regime's third underground nuclear test. The area of Â°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Î°Ï âs nuclear arsenal would not have a single shot left over, let alone the capacity to threaten Western civilization again.A New York Times report Tuesday quoted sources as saying the American government is waiting for South Korea to confirm whether the North Koreans actually did declare the test. The South Korean government, meanwhile, confirmed that it did not.The Pentagon is also waiting for the test to be confirmed by South Korea.The U.S. State Department declined to comment in advance of the publication of the Times report, saying it did not want to tip off the North Koreans to what might be coming next.But on its website, the State Department's Korea specialist, Matthew Rycroft, explained the government's policy to the Times:"Our policy is, and our commitment is to all of the people who live under the North Korean regime, that we look at every single nuclear, ballistic missile and nuclear testing event as an indication of a very real and very serious threat, and we will work in a coordinated, sustained effort to address that threat. But we do not have military plans for any eventuality."The Pentagon has been pressing South Korea to confirm the test, after the government of South Korea sent a report to U.S. Forces Korea advising that its military would not be responding to any North Korean provocation. The U.S. Forces Korea in South Korea are the U.S. forces assigned to protect the forces sent to the Korean Peninsula during the Korean War.The Times report said Thursday's test was triggered by a North Korean rocket that landed in the Sea of Japan	0
As the bloody battles pushed up tragic death tolls on both sides, world powers held a flurry of diplomatic meetings Wednesday aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while several Middle Eastern nations worked to try to win Hamas' agreement for an Egyptian-led cease-fire. But perhaps the most powerful message came from a woman whose son's death played a role in sparking the current fighting. "Your children and our children -- nobody should really go through what we're going through now," said Rachel Fraenkel, whose son Naftali was among three Jewish teens kidnapped and killed on the way home from school in the West Bank last month.  Israel blamed Hamas.  Later, a Palestinian teen was killed in what Israel calls a revenge attack. Israel has indicted an adult and two minors for the killing. The Fraenkels are American citizens.  Yishai Fraenkel, Naftali's uncle, works to bring Palestinians into Israel's high-tech sector. Rachel Fraenkel met with Kerry on Wednesday.  Afterward, speaking to media, she said, "I just want to turn to Palestinian parents and say maybe you can stop Hamas from using you as human shields and your death as propaganda." "I promise the Palestinian parents: All we want is to live in peace and raise our children without threats of missiles or tunnels under our communities," noting that an Israeli kindergarten was struck by a rocket this week -- it was empty at the time. "Maybe we can teach our children that we want to live in peace," she said. Some Palestinian parents visited her family after Naftali's death and they had very good conversations, she said.  "I do know decent, good Palestinian people." Israeli Jewish families also visited the family of Mohammed Abu Khedair, the Palestinian teen killed. Despite Fraenkel's sentiments, many Palestinian parents accuse Israel of carrying out a "massacre" -- and have called on Israelis to push the government to stop military action. "Nobody is safe and nobody can flee anywhere because everywhere is targeted," said a mother of two who lives in the al-Remal neighborhood of Gaza City, as CNN reported Monday.  "When we hear the shelling my kids will cry." Death tolls jump	1
Six hip-hop artists from five countries speaking four languages are on stage, warming up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday. "Warming up" doesn't really capture it; the dancers explode across the stage, each one with a different hip-hop style. Michelle Salazar is chic-grungy in black jeans and white T-shirt, her long black hair swirling around her head. Hassan El Haf, from Lebanon, tall and thin, does a kind of electric hip-hop mixed with salsa. Argentines Mauricio Trech and Silvia Fernandez move in a dramatic break dance. Both hail from Argentina, home of the tango. Hien Ngoc Pham from Vietnam, with a buzz cut and dressed in white jeans and a white T-shirt, has Broadway bravado in his every move. The dancing stops and Samer Samahneh begins rapping -- in Arabic. No translation needed; it comes from his soul. Three weeks ago, the dancers had never met, but now they're a team, participating in the State Department's Cultural Visitors Program. The program consists of three weeks of meeting American hip-hop artists and dancers and visiting New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. "It's like a dream come true for me," Salazar said Tuesday, the day of the team's show, "because I only read their names in the Internet and now, like, I met Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of hip-hop. I was right next to him. It's a real immersion into the culture. I don't want to wake up!" Salazar isn't just star-struck. She's learning a lot and she plans to bring it back to her fellow dancers in the Philippines. "Dancers in the Philippines don't have much of a foundation [in hip-hop]," she says. "They don't understand why dancers do this" -- she moves her arm -- "or why they do this" -- she strikes a pose. "Because if they knew why they would feel it. I can feel it by watching these [American] hip-hop dancers."	1

Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot. The duke will start training in September, a year after leaving the Royal Air Force, where he flew search and rescue  missions in an Airbus A330. He spent nine days doing this for Royal Navy and RAF colleagues last year and now hopes to follow in the footsteps of several other veterans of that service, including Andrew Shrimpton, who is flying with the RAF  in the RAF Chinook as part of their deployment to Afghanistan.Prince William made news when he first announced his plans to pursue a civilian career last year, saying he intended to "do something different from the Royal Air Force." He then added, "I believe there's a lot more to life than work."William has already flown four hours as an Air Traffic Control (ATC) controller and has logged more than 500,000 hours in various roles. His most recent role was as a helicopter search and rescue team leader in Afghanistan with the RAF.The duke is not the first in the royal family to volunteer as an air ambulance pilot. Prince Michael and Princess Caroline of Kent flew as paramedics in 1986 and Prince Harry has been involved in rescue operations flying in an American C-130 Hercules. Prince William's flying is part of a wider commitment to service through the duke's charity, the William Foundation."The duke is very excited about his new role, and I hope to see him do even more," says Charles Moore, president of Airmen First, a private air safety and medical charity and part of the William Foundation. "He is a well-trained pilot who has done his pilot's training and is well versed in the air ambulance role. He has been in the cockpit training aircraft and knows how to fly the Chinook."A major challenge for William as he continues to fulfill his civilian role is having time for a family life. His schedule has included visits to the home of his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge (who married Prince Harry in 2011), and he will be back on duty at RAF Leeming at RAF Shawbury in Lincolnshire in September. This is where he had his initial experience of flying helicopters. He joined the force in 2001 and since then has flown more than 1,000 hours in helicopters, including the same type of aircraft as the Chinook, the CH-47F Chinook	0
A day after 20 million gallons of water gushed out of an old, broken water main, UCLA had quite a mess on its hands Wednesday -- and it still was trying to figure out how big. Hundreds of vehicles were waterlogged and stranded. A famous basketball court might be ruined. "We're nowhere near (figuring the cost) yet," UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader said near the north side of campus, not far from where workers still were trying to stanch residual leaks in the damaged underground Los Angeles water pipe. "Some of the facilities that have water in them, we're not able to make damage assessments yet." The juncture of a 93-year-old water pipe and a 58-year-old pipe burst under famed Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon, city officials said, with the ensuing geyser sending an estimated 20 million gallons of water shooting into the sky and streaming into nearby open areas and buildings -- notably parts of the UCLA campus just to the south. No one was injured, but damage to some campus parking garages and athletic facilities was "substantial," Schmader said. Water rushed into two underground parking facilities, he said. The school said Wednesday afternoon that 960 vehicles were still trapped inside. Those vehicles that aren't trapped appear to have some level of water damage, Schmader said. Most of the autos belonged to UCLA students, faculty and staff members who were on campus for the end of the summer session. "I went back to my car to try and leave, and they told me that I couldn't leave the structure because it was flooded," a woman told CNN affiliate KTLA. "And I walked to the side that was flooded, and I thought, 'So there goes my car.' " Swift-water rescue crews with boats had to ferry away several stranded people Tuesday, and at least three motorists were rescued from the garages. A section of Sunset Boulevard remained closed Wednesday. City councilman Joe Buscaino said the goal was to have the road reopened by Friday. Workers pumped and pushed water out of the damaged facilities. At UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, the recently renovated home of the school's basketball, volleyball and gymnastics teams, 8 to 10 inches of water had collected on the Nell and John Wooden Court, the hoops surface named for the 10-time NCAA title-winning basketball coach and his wife.

Japan's Shimanami Kaido might be an expressway, but it was designed with the cyclist in mind. A spectacular 60-kilometer road-and-bridge network connecting Japan's main island of Honshu with Shikoku (the nation's fourth largest island), it spans six smaller islands in the process and features bike and pedestrian lanes for its entire length. The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture. Whichever way you travel, the views of the Seto Inland Sea National Park are sublime. Cycling gives you the freedom to stop for a photo halfway across a bridge or detour to investigate lighthouses, shrines and natural wonders most automobile travelers zip past. With 14 cycle rental terminals along the way, you can go at your own pace, spend a night at a campsite or inn or just hand your bike in at the nearest rental terminal and hop on a bus. Some terminals even have electric bicycles for hire. Experienced cyclists will be able to complete the entire route  -- there are a few challenging spots -- in a few hours. Here's a look at some of the highlights. Starting point: Onomichi As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station. Manager Katsunori Takahashi is huge cycling enthusiast, and it shows. You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant. Taiwanese bike manufacturer Giant has a store in U2 catering to cyclists: bikes, accessories, repairs. U2's Shima Shop sells local produce such as lemon comfiture and dried debera (five-spot flounder), an Onomichi delicacy. As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama. The walk down the Path of Literature is pleasant -- it winds past past boulders engraved with works by famous writers who've stayed in Onomichi over the centuries.	1

Two U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets -- flying off the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman -- crashed Monday night in the Persian Gulf, U.S. Navy officials said. The aircrafts' three aviators were recovered safely after they ejected from the jets -- a single-seat F/A-18E and two-seat F/A-18F. The U.S. Navy did not immediately know the cause of the F/A-18 crash. There is no indication of hostile fire action, the officials said. The incident is not related to Sunday's confrontation between three U.S. Navy warships and five Iranian boats, Navy officials said. E-mail to a friend	1
Tens of thousands of people have fled fighting between Thailand and Cambodia over the past week, 30 people have been injured, and five Thai soldiers have been killed, the Thai Ministry of Public Health said Tuesday. About 27,000 people are living in 33 temporary shelters in Thailand, the ministry said. Clashes between the two sides began last Friday, with each country accusing the other of trying to seize two ancient temples. Thai Foreign Minsiter Kasit Piromya visited the province and said in a statement Tuesday that Cambodia is still attacking Thais. There was a brief exchange of fire between Cambodian and Thai troops Tuesday afternoon, but it was calmed quickly, Thai Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said. There were no new casualties from the incident, which he said resulted from a misunderstanding stemming from a routine Air Force exercise. Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Thailand calls them Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that the United States "remains deeply concerned about clashes between security forces along the Thailand-Cambodia border." The U.S. government is speaking directly to Thai and Cambodian officials, and also supports efforts by Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to work with both countries on a resolution, Clinton's statement said. The fighting on the ground has been coupled with a war of words in recent days. Cambodia said Monday that Thai warplanes had entered its airspace and that the Thai military had shelled populated Cambodian territory. Cambodia's government has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting. On Sunday, Sansern accused Cambodian troops of opening fire first and said Thai troops responded to protect their country's sovereignty. In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first.	1
Choi Byung Kwan undertook a special operation for the Republic of Korea's army in one of the world's most sensitive areas. He was not a highly trained soldier, but a photographer armed only with a camera. Over a period of years in the late 1990s and early 2000s he traversed the 155-mile truce line of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that divides the Korean peninsular photographing the area's remarkable ecology that was littered with reminders of the Korean war. "I often came across fantastically charming wild flowers blossoming through the bullet holes of rusty iron helmets in mine fields," he says. "[T]hey always struck a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow in my heart because they looked like reincarnations of the young souls of fallen soldiers." His photographs will be shown in an exhibition at the UN headquarters in New York in June commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Korean war, and it is hoped by Choi, celebrating peace. "I gradually realized during my work that the Korean DMZ was not only a valuable source of irreplaceable natural life but also a historical site reminding humanity of the preciousness of peace," Choi says. "I thought many times that this buffer zone deserved serious international attention as a possible world conservation site, which could naturally facilitate peace in the Korean peninsula."	1

Federal authorities on Friday arrested a man on a weapons charge as he was being released from a Los Angeles County jail a day after he pleaded guilty in the 2011 brutal beating of a iced cabbie.Mark Caguas, 44, had a loaded handgun, a .45 caliber Glock, when he was released from the Los Angeles County Jail in Boyle Heights on Wednesday, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. Rick Doyle said.The man's bond will be set Monday, said the sheriff's department. Caguas pleaded guilty last week to a single count of receiving and concealing a weapon.Caguas was sentenced to two years in prison when he was convicted last September.The incident occurred at the end of the night shift at the corner of Pico and Santa Monica boulevards in Boyle Heights on April 8, 2011.The victim was on his way home from a bar, but an argument involving Caguas and some other friends of his escalated and turned into a brutal beating lasting more than an hour.A jury convicted Caguas on two charges: voluntary manslaughter and murder that resulted from the beating.After Caguas was released, police said he told them he went to the parking lot and tried to buy a gun. He was arrested again on June 2, 2011 near the scene of the beating.He told authorities he went to Boyle Heights and bought a gun there, but said he sold it after a dispute with his former brother-in-law and a neighbor.A gun with which Caguas was arrested in June 2011, which he admitted to owning, is used to kill in the murder of Manuel Diaz-Zarate, a rival gang member, who was killed in the June 3, 2012, hit-and-run attack in East San Fernando Valley.A man arrested last month after the murder had the same gun, Los Angeles County sheriff's records show.A police investigator testified in court Friday that Caguas, as a suspect in the beating, initially told detectives that he acted alone. He later said a different person had been involved and gave a different account, which was recorded.The investigator testified that Caguas had told him he had gone to the bar with some of his friends to buy a gun but never intended his friends to carry it.He told the officer that he had no money to pay for	0
The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of irl voters.From the moment billionaire businessman Donald Trump announced his candidacy, he seemed to set his campaign apart from the rest of the Republican field.He delivered sharp and fact-filled attacks on his rivals, calling them “crooked” and “crooks,” and offering an attack line against his rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, whom Trump said is just part of another “rigged” game.Trump has been drawing crowds and big money ever since he burst onto the political scene. He is a polarizing figure, but he certainly is not alone.After his announcement, Trump was greeted with a standing ovation at a party in Cedar Rapids, where he was introduced by former Gov. Mike Huckabee.Cruz then spoke, and the crowd went wild. Trump followed with his own speech, and the crowd was even louder.In the weeks of campaigning, Cruz has taken on the role of de-facto co-front-runner to Trump’s. Cruz was often the first to offer criticisms of Trump, and often the first to take shots at rival front-runner Iowa Sen. Marco Rubio.Cruz and Trump have now turned more of their time and energy over to debating. Cruz has already declared that he won’t seek political gain by attacking Trump by way of negative campaigning. But he also refused to say whether he would stay in the race if he is the nominee.Trump has been very active on Twitter, retweeting a statement from Cruz’s campaign manager that Trump “must drop out.”Both candidates have made comments about the size of the crowds they have had standing in front of them. Cruz, for example, has said, “We’re in Trump country” during his speech and also said, about Trump’s crowd last night: “We’re in Trump country.”But the real star of Trump’s Iowa appearances was Sen. Marco Rubio’s first trip to the state, where he gave a blistering attack on Cruz, calling him “weak on immigration” and a “failed presidential candidate,” and	0

Al Qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal Yemeni city of Al Mukallah early Thursday, freeing at least 270 prisoners, a third of whom have al Qaeda links, a senior security official said.The official said the first group of freed prisoners broke free during the first explosion of the strike, a major facility housing women and children. The remaining 380, he said, were freed after the second explosion, the strike that freed the remaining prisoners, whose release coincided with the death of two children.Both of the first two explosions are believed to have occurred near the prison complex. The official said the first released prisoners came from at least three Al Qaeda-held prisons, includingthe one near the prison that was attacked, and could have included senior operatives from the world's mostsurgically-equipped Islamist organization.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the prison attack, which came as Yemeni security forces and allied tribal fighters were fighting the al Qaeda affiliatethat controls the city.But the official told The Times that the attack suggests "the first group of freed prisoners is Al Qaeda operatives who are either prisoners in Yemen or fighters whohave been released from other militant prisons."The official added that there had been numerous reports that the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, had been holding prisoners in thecity.Officials in the United Arab Emirates, which has been training Yemeni forces in its air and naval bases along the Gulf, confirmed the U.S. military had been invited tohelp with training and to help provide weapons for the campaign against al Qaeda.A U.S. defense official familiar with the request said the U.S. had discussed it this week in meetings with senior Emirati defense officials. But in the past, the United States hadsent combat troops to Yemen on a limited basis, in support of anti-drug operations.A second defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the effort, added that the U.S. request for troops "fits in with what wehave seen" as a broader strategy in which "the more we can do, the better it is for our national security."The official said the U.S. officials briefed on the request had expressed concern that U.S. assistance could "create a security environment that the al Qaeda in the ArabianPen	0
Environmentally friendly engineering is really right up Chicago's alley -- in a city project called Green Alleys. Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan. The program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city's alleyways from ending up in adjacent Lake Michigan. Chicago's 13,000 alleys, which allow rear access to buildings, date back to the 1800s. The 1,900 miles of back alleys ease access for garbage collection, loading and parking. They also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface, which has created a big problem. Many of the alleys were built without connections to storm sewers. Rainwater puddles on the pavement and can run into buildings, sometimes flooding basements. "We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system," said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation. So, the extreme alley makeover started with the pavement. The alleys are being resurfaced with concrete, asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is, water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath. Microbes that thrive on stuff like fertilizer and oil are seeded into the pavement or migrate there naturally. They cleanse the water of pollutants from cars and lawns. The cleaner water makes its way into the groundwater, called an aquifer, and then flows into Lake Michigan. That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year. But only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake, Attarian said. "So by infiltrating that aquifer, we have a chance to [give] some of that water back." Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light. The surface is lighter in color, reflecting more sunlight and absorbing less. "It's like putting on a white T-shirt instead of a black one on a hot summer day," Attarian said. "It cools the city off and reduces our carbon footprint." Other features of the Green Alley program include the use of recycled materials in pavement and energy-efficient light fixtures that direct light downward to reduce light pollution.	1
President Barack Obama officially begins his second term today, a day ahead of his public swearing in and all the pomp and ceremony of a U.S. presidential inauguration. Because the Constitution calls for the president to be sworn in on January 20, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in for their second terms in relatively quiet ceremonies before they take their public oaths in front of the Capitol on Monday and before an audience spread down the National Mall. Obama's Monday address will lay out the values and vision for his second term and acknowledge the division in Washington but won't address policy, a source with knowledge of the speech told CNN on the condition of anonymity. He'll lay out policy in his February 12 State of the Union address, the source said. Obama to acknowledge divided Washington in inaugural address Obama was still working on his speech on Saturday, the source said. The nation's first African-American president also will become only the 17th U.S. leader to deliver a second inaugural address before joining the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. For his second inauguration, less than half of the estimated 1.8 million onlookers who crammed the Mall in 2009 are expected -- organizers expect 800,000 people to attend Monday's public ceremony. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN platforms The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first four years. Inauguration activities kicked off on Saturday with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama and Biden and his wife Dr. Jill Biden leading volunteers across the country in National Day of Service Activities. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service The Obamas joined in a project at Burrville Elementary School in Washington, aiding volunteers who were staining a bookcase. Cameras at the school caught the president and first lady staining a bookcase. The president told volunteers that his family would do volunteer projects on holidays, "So I was taught from a young age." Volunteering "is really what America is all about," he said. The Bidens helped to put together care packages for service members deployed overseas at the National Guard Armory in Washington. Biden's office said volunteers at the armory would produce 100,000 packages.	1
Former Argentina international defender Fernando Caceres is fighting for his life in a Buenos Aires hospital after being shot in the head during an armed robbery. The 40-year-old Caceres, who played for Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, was gunned down as a gang tried to steal his BMW car in the early hours of Sunday morning. A bullet has reportedly entered his head through his right eye, and he remains in a coma in a grave condition. Caceres was visited by his former Boca Juniors teammate and national coach Diego Maradona, who clearly distressed, told reporters outside the hospital that crime was rife in the Argentine capital. "This is a time bomb, going out is a constant danger," Maradona told television station TyCSports. "This happens every day, nobody does anything and something must be done. "Caceres is in the hands of God and I hope it helps," Maradona added. The attack happened in the Fort Apache area of Buenos Aires, which is where Manchester City star Carlos Tevez grew up, and is notorious for high crime levels. Players from two of his former clubs, Argentinos Juniors and Independiente displayed a banner of support for him ahead of their later match in the Argentine league on Sunday. Caceres won the league title with River Plate in 1991 and the European Cup Winners Cup with Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 1995. He played 24 games for Argentina, helping them to the Copa America in 1993 before appearing at the World Cup finals in the United States a year later. Caceres ended his playing career at his original club of Argentinos Juniors in 2007 and has been coaching at Independiente.	1
Before Ellen DeGeneres was out and proud and dancing every day on her talk show, when heterosexual male actors wouldn't dare to play gay, and violence against gay people was the talking point of the day for LGBT activists, there was transgender activist Leslie Feinberg. It's hard to find Feinberg's 1993 classic novel, "Stone Butch Blues," today. The novel's protagonist starts out as a girl and moves through the identities of being lesbian, butch and a man in the 1960s and 1970s. "You're more than just neither, honey," Feinberg wrote in "Stone Butch Blues." "There's other ways to be than either-or. It's not so simple. Otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who don't fit." Like the customers who had enough of police brutality and rioted at New York's Stonewall Inn in 1969 and energized a movement, there was no closet big enough to hold Feinberg, who passed away November 15 at age 65. Feinberg died at home in Syracuse, New York, from complications from several infections, her spouse of 22 years, Minnie Bruce Pratt, told The Advocate. She was working on the 20th anniversary edition of "Stone Butch Blues" when she died. When I first read her book, the landscape for LGBT rights was very different. For a 20-something like me coming out in the early 1990s, there was nothing trendy or cool about being out. It was dangerous territory. Forget ever getting married: There was no law that protected me from being fired or attacked because of my identity. I didn't "look" gay so I could hide, as I had through my teen years and most of my undergraduate education. I could quietly enjoy the benefits of the work done by Feinberg and other transgender activists, butch women, gay men and drag queens who could not or would not fade into the shadows. Feinberg and the other people who would not be silent taught me that was not a way to live, to truly live, standing on the backs of others without lifting any of the load myself. Always a writer and journalist, I came out during my last year in college, stayed out in graduate school, and have been out at every job I've ever held; I did service work in my profession to bridge the gaps between journalists of different racial, ethnic, LGBT and other identities.	1
Turkey made a significant policy shift Monday when it announced it would allow Kurdish Peshmerga fighters from northern Iraq to travel through the Turkish territory to reinforce the besieged Kurdish town of Kobani in northern Syria. The announcement Â comes a day after Turkeyâ€™s president said it would accept refugees from Iraq â€œin waves,â€ and on the eve of a meeting in Turkey between members of the U.N. Security Council and Kurdish groups seeking a cease-fire in northern Syria.The Kurdish fighters that Turkey has been allowing to travel from Iraq into its territory â€“ along with refugees who crossed the border illegally â€“ could be used to bolster Kobani. Last year, Turkey expelled more than 50,000 Iraqi refugees from Turkey. Kobani is now on the frontline between Turkey and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Iraqi Kurds want Kobani for its strategic value as an important town that could block ISIS from using its border crossing to move men and supplies between Iraq and Syria.The situation in Kobani â€“ where ISIS destroyed homes, buildings, churches, the police station and other public spaces â€“ is at a critical turning point, making this act in a positive direction for the Kurds. ISIS fighters, after an unsuccessful attempt to launch an offensive in October, pulled out of the town and moved to a nearby Syrian village.With its policy reversal, Turkey is playing a key role in the struggle to save Kobani. The key to the solution lies in the Kurdsâ€™ ability to create the local security forces that will take control of the Kobani battle positions. It is in such an environment that Kurdish-led security forces must also be created to protect the civilians in Kobani and other parts of northern Syria. The key to creating security and protecting the population of Kobani is the Iraqi Kurds.Turkey has the capability to create the local police and security forces needed to protect the population of Kobani, but it must not put its efforts at risk. Turkey should not allow the creation of Kurdish police or security forces that are not controlled by Iraq.Bans on arms sales to Iraq of any kind could set a dangerous precedent.In a move that is a clear example of hypocrisy, the Iraqi government, which has now accepted weapons and advanced weapons from the U.S. government despite the fact it has allowed the U.	0
No. 2 Alabama clobbered No. 1 Louisiana State University Monday night, winning college football's іnstіmѕіzаtion with a 34–13 victory at Bryant-Denny Stadium. The victory was Alabama's second national title since 2000; the Crimson Tide also captured the 2001 and 2007 crowns.The Crimson Tide (7–1) got off to a slow start and managed just three points in the first half on its way to a 0–3 all-time record against the Tigers (6–1). Alabama led from the start, 10–3, but LSU had a good second-half fightback to regain the lead, 20–13, with just under nine minutes remaining in the game. Alabama answered with a pair of touchdown drives to take a 30–23 lead with 3:07 left. But the Tigers were able to take command of the game in the final three minutes of the game, driving to the Alabama 34 before scoring one final time on a 30-yard pass from C. J. Mosley to Anthony Hines. The win represented the first time Alabama has won a national championship game since 1982, and the first at Bryant-Denny since 1968."It's a great accomplishment for a bunch of us," Saban said. "You never forget the first time you win. I said before the game, this is the greatest job I've ever had. I feel it, everybody feels it. It's an understatement to say that it's a great accomplishment for me, and for this team, and I think it's a big step in our program."In the first half, Alabama forced five punts and had a trio of third-down snaps called back or declined from penalties."I knew we were going to have to do a tremendous job against the run," Saban said. "Their defense was a step ahead of us. They were a step ahead of us in a lot of things. They did a great job shutting down our running game, and they did a better job of doing so going into the second half."The Tide offense, too, was effective in slowing down LSU's offense. It was no coincidence that the Tigers had just three consecutive scores early in the second half."We did a great job of stopping their offense," Saban said. "We had to make some plays, obviously, on the defensive side, too	0
Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent. And he knew that it would come from within. The 21-year-old Marine was posted to Garmsir in Helmand Province, where he was training local security forces as part of NATO's planned withdrawal in 2014. It was during a static-filled phone call to his father over the summer that the Long Island native mentioned a run-in he had with an Afghan trainee while on guard duty. NATO releases details of brazen raid on base in Afghanistan The encounter was the first in which the Buckley family's eldest son seemed to sense something was wrong, according to what he told his family in phone conversations and a letter. "The guy turned around and said to Greg, 'We don't want you here. We don't need you here,'" his dad said. "Greg turned around again and said, 'Why would you say that?'" according to Greg Buckley Sr. But the trainee apparently wouldn't relent, repeating the phrases for hours over the course of a night in which the young Marine was on guard watch. "Greg said, 'I thought I was going to lose my mind,'" his father said. "Pitch black out, and all he kept saying over and over again is, 'We don't want you. We don't need you. We don't want you.'" "It was just tormenting for him." The two men then finally confronted each other, yelling until a group of officers separated them, he told his father. "One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley. The 21-year-old agreed and extended his hand, but the man refused. About a month later, Greg phoned his father again. "He told me if I have to stay here until November... I'm not going to come home." Greg also asked his father to prepare to tell his mother and his two younger brothers that he'd be killed. "I don't understand," his father said. "Out in the field?' "No, in our base," Greg replied. 4 NATO troops killed in 'insider' attack in Afghanistan On August 10, 2012, Greg Buckley Jr. was gunned down by the very forces he had been training, just days after learning that he was to head home early.	1
Triumphant Republicans return to Washington Wednesday to prepare for a new era of GOP dominance on both sides of the Capitol. But first, they have to get through a short, final Senate session under Democratic control. The post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business, including a must pass bill to fund the government, and other bills to arm Syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks.  Republican leaders are anxious to start the new Congress in January with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats. Senators who were defeated in the last election must return to the Capitol to vote on these items.  But newly-elected senators, excited after their victories, can't vote until they are sworn-in in January. The incoming freshmen will be here for three days of intensive orientation. Unlike past orientations, when senators were given heavy binders and detailed briefings about foreign policy, national security, and other current topics, this week's sessions will deal more with the practical matters of operating a Senate office, including hiring, disbursement, and ethics rules. They will be conducted by individual senators who will share their experiences. There will be a special dinner honoring the new members and their spouses Wednesday night in the Capitol. The incoming members will also be assigned temporary office space for use until they move into their permanent digs sometime next year. Like an overcrowded elementary school, those offices will be housed in trailers sandwiched into the courtyard of the Russell Senate office building. While the lame duck agenda is packed, one controversial item the Senate may not deal with until next year is approving Loretta Lynch to be the new Attorney General. Democrats signaled Tuesday they are unlikely to try to confirm her even though if they moved now, they could approve her with just Democratic votes. Democrats say Lynch, who has been confirmed twice by the Senate, is highly qualified and will be approved regardless of who controls the chamber. "There may be some who feel they have to vote no simply because it's a nominee by President Obama," Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said in an MSNBC interview Tuesday.  "But the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats will vote for her.  She's superbly qualified." However, most Republicans don't want to rush the process, preferring to explore more carefully Lynch's background and views on immigration and other hot-button subjects.	1
Some people hire florists and caterers when planning their wedding. Former Google employee Brit Morin brought on a programmer to create a custom app. That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech. In the year since it launched, Brit + Co. has created tons of step-by-step posts, filmed how-to videos staring Brit, brought in user-generated projects and started selling merchandise such as crafting starter kits, books and subscription boxes called Brit Kits. For $20 a month, Brit + Co. will deliver a Brit Kit box filled with crafting materials and instructions for projects such as gloves that work on touchscreen devices. Last week, Brit.co entered its newest stage by branching out into content aggregation with a feature called Brit's Picks. The company is pulling in posts from 25 popular crafting and style sites, including Style Me Pretty, Oh Happy Day and Smitten Kitchen, and hand-picking the best posts to share with the Brit.co readers. Inspired by the Maker movement and the tech culture of Silicon Valley, Morin wanted to combine her interest in technology and crafting with the popular Maker movement. "There was really no voice or teacher, specifically on the female side, who was really sharing all of these new innovations with those inspired to live creatively," she said of the maker culture. The projects on Brit.co are fairly simple and meant to be completed quickly, but many incorporate cool gadgetry such as 3D and laser printers, or wired elements such as Arduino kits, which are do-it-yourself computing and circuitry kits. There are recipes for no-bake peanut butter and jelly pie, instructions on how to create homemade headbands in less than five minutes, and plenty of iPhone app and accessory round-ups. One of Morin's favorite recent projects was an LED cowboy hat she wore to the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Using littleBits pieces, she stitched wire into the hat to spell out her Twitter handle. "Being from Texas, it really showed who I am: a little bit style, a little bit country and a little bit tech," said Morin.	1
Turkey is positioned as the geographic, economic and political bridge straddling both Asia and Europe. How Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan performs if he secures a first round victory in Sunday's Presidential election will determine if this sizable emerging market can restore its luster as an engine for growth and a regional political force. The scrappy former mayor of Istanbul came to power promising a new brand of Islam under the party he co-founded, the Justice and Development Party (AKP): One that is pro-business and one that in the recent past juggled good relations with both Israel and Iran. Economically speaking, Erdogan has delivered. Turkey enjoyed growth of 6-8% for the better part of his first decade in power. Gone are the days of hyper-inflation (although the latest reading of 9.3% in July is not low) -- as well as the multiple zeroes at the end of lira notes -- thanks to the currency stability he introduced The current prime minister became the darling of Fortune 500 companies, which took advantage of the European Union Customs Union offering lower export tariffs, and turned Turkey into a manufacturing hub for Europe. Foreign direct investment surged ten-fold, from just $20 billion in 2001 to over $200 billion today. 3,300 international companies now call Turkey home according to UNCTAD. But many believe this presidential election will not broaden democracy in Turkey, but only help Erdogan consolidate his grip on power in an effort to burnish his legacy. "Erdogan's 12 month strategy is to engineer, de jure or de facto, as much of a transfer of power from the prime minister's office to the presidential palace as he can," wrote Professor Henri Barkey of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. This strategy could dilute the role of the Turkish parliament and allow the president to hand-pick his successor as prime minister. Those who are close to the current President Abdullah Gul tell me the moderate counter-weight to Erdogan will stay out of the political cross-fire and let this experiment to create a presidential system of government play out. But they say a successful transition is not a given. But after suffering through a year of intense protests, a barrage of accusations and investigations linked to corruption at the top of his government and a challenge from afar by former ally, the Pennsylvania based religious leader Fethullah Gulen, Erdogan not only seems undeterred, but more emboldened than ever.	1
Months after a jury couldn't decide his fate, a Southern California teen has agreed to plead guilty for gunning down a gay classmate three years ago in their junior high classroom. In September, a judge declared a mistrial in the case of Brandon McInerney, now 17, after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked following a nine-week trial on whether he should be found guilty of manslaughter or murder. The next month, the Ventura County District Attorney's Office announced that McInerney would be retried on first-degree murder charges as an adult. McInerney also was tried as an adult in the first trial. The district attorney's office said Monday that, since then, it had "carefully reviewed the jury's determination" and talked with some jurors. It also engaged in talks with the victim's family, McInerney and his attorneys after which the relevant parties "agreed upon a disposition that balances the unique facts of the case with the need to protect the public." Specifically, McInerney pleaded guilty to killing Lawrence King "under the penal code sections for both murder and voluntary manslaughter," as well as to using a firearm in that crime. He will serve 11 years for manslaughter and 10 years for the use of a firearm, according to the district attorney's office. His formal sentencing is set for December 19. "He will serve the entire 21 years without time off for good behavior and will not receive time off his sentence for the three years and nine months he has spent in juvenile hall before sentencing," the prosecutor's office said, concluding that he'd then serve nearly 25 years total. Had he been convicted on all the new charges , McInerney would have faced a maximum sentence of 50 years to life in prison. His defense attorney, Scott Wippert, told CNN affiliate KABC he thought the sentence was "appropriate ... given all of the circumstances and all the evidence that came out at trial." "Obviously, we've always been of the opinion that he should have been tried as a juvenile," Wippert said. "But that aside, given that he's in adult court, I think that this sentence reflects the sentiments of the jury." McInerney was 14 when he brought a handgun belonging to relatives to E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, prosecutors said.	1
Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman. The 20-term New York Democrat told  the House that he will temporarily step aside while a formal investigation is held into allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in improper gifts and loans to political allies.The House Ethics Committee was expected to issue a subpoena for Mr. Rangel in an attempt to force him to testify before a grand jury over the weekend. The ethics probe focuses on allegations that he violated House rules by spending more than $30,000 on gifts and loans from his office to at least six people, including his wife, two daughters and a former aide who worked for him as a legislative assistant.The ethics committee is considering whether there is enough evidence to recommend that Mr. Rangel should be permanently censured or even suspended from the House or expelled from Congress.His committee has been divided over the issue, but is expected to issue a recommendation for censure on or before Oct. 18, when Congress returns from its spring break. Mr. Rangel was a freshman Democrat and his office has said it is “fully cooperating” with the House Ethics Committee.The House Ethics Committee had little choice but to look into Mr. Rangel’s spending practices. The investigation was sparked by a Washington Times report last week that detailed his questionable spending habits as he tried to boost his legislative career. In recent years, several ethics experts said, he had overspent his $140,000 per year salary as a lawmaker and had provided gifts worth $1 million to nearly a dozen individuals.The ethics investigation is not the first time Mr. Rangel has been under scrutiny over his spending. Several other lawmakers are under an ethics investigation or are under criminal investigation for improper personal and political gifts or loans to themselves.Mr. Rangel has maintained that the spending on his staff was legal, pointing to a memo by his top aide. In an internal committee report, James Johnson wrote that he and his staff were prohibited from soliciting loans from donors or family members, and were forbidden from making gifts of any kind to himself, his family or their friends or relatives.The memo, obtained by the Times, said that Mr. Rangel could “take a loan at the staffer level of $1,000 through the staff development	0
Oscar Pistorius will once again don the blade-shaped prosthetic legs, which he has made famous, and dash around a track, his family said. But the Olympic athlete charged with premeditated murder for the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, is not training to compete again. He is running for the sake of his emotional health, the statement said. "His focus at this time remains entirely on the court case," the family said Thursday. They have pushed him to spend time on the track in hopes it will help him "process his trauma and prepare for the trial." Pistorius is scheduled to appear in court again on August 19, which would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his apartment. He says he mistook her for a home invader.

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was at home Saturday after leaving a hospital where he underwent surgery for prostate cancer this week. "A million ́s of people died in the Holocaust... I am very worried right now because... I am going through a very difficult time," Santos said during the press conference that followed.He also said he did not want his doctors to force him to have the surgery. "I don’t want to do any type of surgery. I want to rest. I want to be strong, to be courageous," said Santos.He also said that the surgery was not for political reasons, but because he was suffering from complications."The cancer... was found in the beginning of this year. It was diagnosed, so we have a long list of tests. The cancer was already advanced," Santos said. "A year ago... I already had more than 20 operations."Before the press conference, thousands of Colombians took to the streets to protest the president’s decision to have the surgery.Colombia’s anti-corruption commission has issued arrest warrants for ex-President Alvaro Uribe and other top officials and is investigating the U.S.-based financial services firm Mossack Fonseca for potential “malfeasance.”Mossack Fonseca was at the center of the controversy surrounding the Panama Papers, a massive leak of millions of confidential documents by the law firm at the center of the scandal, who’s chairman is a U.S. national. The documents showed how multinational companies and their political and business backers used the law firm to help them avoid tax and manipulate governments around the world.But the company issued an apology for its role in the scandal after Panama’s Attorney General said it was not involved in the documents and instead "malfeasance" took place.Santos first began experiencing symptoms of prostate cancer in 2013. In April of this year, he underwent a biopsy at the National Institute of Oncology in Bogota, during which the cancer was discovered and quickly referred to the University of Bogota.In December, Santos’ health took a turn for the worse after his doctors detected a tumor in his liver, and another one in his bladder. He underwent surgical procedures on both of his lungs to remove the cancerous tumors.The	0
Toronto police made a gruesome discovery Wednesday when they opened a suitcase that two boaters on Lake Ontario had towed back to shore. Inside was a badly decomposed ursine carcass with a head, arms and legs at a mummified state. Police and wildlife experts are still looking for the missing woman.When a woman was found murdered in a hotel room in Ontario with the woman's dog inside the room, the public got a glimpse into the twisted minds of the killer and his victim.In the early 2000s, a man and his dog were killed by his ex-wife's boyfriend in what police called a bizarre murder spree in Michigan. Two years later, the man's body was found near the body of a young actress.Two cases are similar, but one was made to look like self-defense while the other was made to look like a sex crime by the person's ex-wife. The cases have one thing in common: Both involve a dog.The man's body was discovered by a stranger off a Michigan highway, a day after his former wife, the woman who accused him of murdering her, wrote a post that was seen as a threat to the woman. In the post, the woman said she would take the man's life if he didn't stop her from leaving him. "It hurts, it really hurts," the woman wrote. "But I love you, I really love you. I have been through so much with you."The ex-wife, who was known as "Melissa" in police reports, killed her former husband in 2007. Now, three years later, her former boyfriend is accused of killing her pet dog, as well.A judge issued a gag order in the case to help prevent further information about the crime from leaking into the media. The gag order, which forbids information about the case from being published, and can prevent journalists from mentioning the case and even from mentioning the name of the former wife, still does not tell the whole story of the crime.Melissa has been charged with animal cruelty after the death of her dog, while her ex-husband is still facing unrelated animal cruelty charges. Both are facing charges of domestic assault, and the former girlfriend faces a domestic abuse charge that alleges she threatened the victim with a knife.Michigan police said Melissa's ex-husband found her dead.WDIV-TV reported that the man called 911	0
At 16, my innocence was shattered when two gunmen murdered 13 people at my school and wounded countless others. Columbine High School promised to be a safe and secure place of learning. And that promise was broken on April  20, 1999. A gunman, dressed as an usher, entered the school with a small arsenal of tools. He fired from the front door, then used two cars to drive to the gym and a parking lot, where he began firing at everyone inside. He killed a teacher and a student. He then returned, armed with a rifle, and continued fire. As students hid under school desks, he shot more. He drove away and died as police confronted him.The tragedy happened close to home, in the suburban community of Columbine, Colorado. There were no signs or other warning of the threat. In an instant, children from kindergarten through high school, a town of 3,700 people, lost their futures and their lives. Today, it remains an unsolved mystery with no clear motive or suspects. It is almost certainly the product of a deranged mind. No one involved in the shooting lived through the experience, one victim dying at 21.In 2002, I graduated from Columbine High School. My story did not include an event that happened in the school, but I felt that Columbine was an important and tragic event that deserves to be told. Over the years, many people have told me that it did not happen and that I was mistaken, but I refuse to accept that. Columbine was real, and the violence that occurred inside the school was real.Here is my account, the most complete account that I know. When I began the writing of this book, I had a list of people I wanted to interview, which I called my “Key Players List.” And I still have some of those people. As time passes, my list becomes more and more incomplete. I keep adding people when I find them. At the outset, I thought I would interview only those who were present at the tragedy. But when I contacted people about the story, many I had originally thought were important people, they suggested other sources. That made my list more comprehensive than it initially was.I kept getting e-mails and letters from former students asking questions about it. These students had been involved in the school’s decision, about which I wrote many times before launching this book, and still have the answers to	0
The International Committee of the Red Cross has been granted access to a detention facility in Syria for the first time since unrest broke out in the country, the committee's president said Monday after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called the breakthrough "an important step forward for our humanitarian activities in Syria." Kellenberger's meeting with al-Assad occurred amid mounting reports of bloodshed by Syrian security forces. On Monday, security forces killed six people during an ongoing crackdown in the province of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group. The group also reported a similar offensive in Idlib province, where security forces entered with seven armored vehicles, nine cars and four buses. Seventy people were arrested in the operation, and dozens of homes were raided, the opposition group said. Syria has been engulfed in public protest for months, and the regime has been accused internationally of a crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The government has maintained it is targeting armed terrorists. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter. "Ensuring that the sick and the wounded have access to medical care will be among the particularly urgent humanitarian challenges to be addressed with the Syrian authorities," the Red Cross said in a statement. The committee will initially be allowed to see only people detained by the Ministry of Interior, Kellenberger said, adding, "We are hopeful that we will soon be able to visit all detainees." Also Monday, the Arab League announced that its secretary general, Nabil al-Araby, will travel to Damascus on Wednesday. The Arab League last week publicly called for restraint and an end to the violence in Syria. Kellenberger's two-day visit kicked off Sunday with meetings with Prime Minister Adel Safar and Foreign Minister Walid Muallem. The Syrian government said it briefed Kellenberger on the regime's efforts to "restore stability and security to the country." Reports have surfaced of people not being able to access medical care during security operations. The foreign minister "stressed that the public hospitals in Syria are constantly ready and provide the required medical services for all the citizens," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Monday. The news agency added that Muallem "appreciated the humanitarian activities of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Organization which has played an effective role in providing the humanitarian needs of the citizens during the current crisis."	1
If he had been listening from his car Monday morning, radio veteran Steak Shapiro knew what he would have thought of a bit mocking a former New Orleans Saint now battling Lou Gehrig's disease. "I would have  heard: This is a great story for CBS. This guy is a great athlete. This guy is a good guy. This guy is a great competitor," said Shapiro, who broadcast for 13 seasons on CBS Radio. "That would have been the story that was told."The call was from ESPN sports announcer Al McGuire.McGuire was in New Orleans attending a baseball game, a Friday night game between the Mets and Braves. He was supposed to call the Braves-Mets game in a pre-game segment but instead was doing what he could to give a moment of thanks to the Saints.The Mets were trailing by four, 15-6, in the top of the ninth.That's when he heard his name, saying "Hey, Al, listen to this!"McGuire turned on the radio. It was a CBS Sports Radio post-game show. "Hey, Al!" He heard a few words and thought he was being introduced to Steak Shapiro. "Can you come on the air?"He did. Shapiro, who is still recovering from surgery Tuesday to repair two rotator-cuff tears, played up his fight against Gehrig's disease. Shapiro says his condition is not related to the surgery. (Gehrig, who is currently in a Boston hospital, has been in intensive care since suffering a stroke on October 1.)"You know, I think it's a pretty great story," Shapiro said. "I mean, to see this guy, this superstar athlete, still fighting for his life, still fighting for his life.""My guess is that he's the only guy alive today that is fighting for his life against Lou Gehrig's disease." Shapiro said, speaking of Gehrig."I mean, you wonder how that's possible," he said."I don't know."Shapiro's post-game comments were an attempt to ease Gehrig's heartbreak. "Listen, Lou, you're going to be fine," Shapiro said. "You're going to recover. You're going to be back on the field in no time. And I promise you, that fight is not going to end	0
Rizana Nafeek was a child herself -- 17 years old, according to her birth certificate -- when a four-month-old baby died in her care in Saudi Arabia. She had migrated from Sri Lanka only weeks earlier to be a domestic worker  in Riyadh. There, she married a young man who was just a few years older than Rizana. But that marriage was a mistake; within months, he was gone.For a year and a half, she lived with his brother, before escaping to Dhaka in the east of Bangladesh. There, Rizana found work as an illegal domestic worker, making $3 a day for a woman, according to some interviews and court documents she provided.Last week, police accused her of killing the 16-year-old girl, whose body was found on March 12. Her family, which was in touch with Rizana's, said the same day that she had been working illegally with them. On March 16, she disappeared.Rizana had no known criminal record. She had only worked in the United Arab Emirates, a country well known for providing international domestic workers. She told friends that she had started work there when she was four years old.Rizana's case is the latest example of abuse and exploitation of foreign domestic workers, an expanding workforce that is rapidly growing worldwide. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls are working in many countries for such jobs as caregiving, child care, housekeeping, and laundry. Most come from countries that have little or no social security or protection for the workers."This case highlights the urgent need to address the abuse of hundreds of thousands of unpaid and illegal domestic workers by unscrupulous employers," said Rebecca Gomperts, a senior campaigner at Amnesty International.But Rizana's case is unusual because of her young age, a fact that raised questions about whether the law was being enforced in her country. On top of that, even if her employer was abusive, she was never legally employed in the United Arab Emirates.She found a way to get out of the country and has since disappeared, her friends said."She was not a domestic worker, she is not a victim," said Nafisa, who runs the Dhaka cafe she owned with her husband."She is responsible for her actions, and she needs to face the consequences of her action."	0
The IRS says it's still trying to reach some 5 million Americans -- primarily seniors and veterans -- who have not filed the tax returns needed to qualify for their stimulus checks. The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks. "This hasn't been the easiest undertaking for the IRS," Commissioner Doug Shulman told the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight on Thursday. Shulman explained that the IRS had sent out information packages to 20.5 million recipients of Social Security or veterans benefits who did not file 2006 tax returns to explain how to claim their payments. Around 15 million responded. The commissioner says the agency will soon send a second notice to the remaining 5.2 million and launch an aggressive public relations campaign titled, "It's Not Too Late to File!" In all, the IRS has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks, in amounts up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for married couples and $300 per child for families. The checks mailed nationwide so far total $63.8 billion, Shulman said. He predicted the total by the end of the calendar year would reach $100 billion. IRS phone banks have been inundated with questions about the stimulus payments, which began going out in April. The commissioner said the IRS received 72 million calls in May this year, compared with 19 million in May 2007. "The numbers are staggering," he said. Shulman apologized for the now 13-minute average wait time to get an IRS employee on the phone, saying, "It's where we'd not like to be, but it's a fact of doing stimulus." Nina Olson, the IRS' national taxpayer advocate, said only a few glitches had developed in the stimulus effort. One occurred when the Social Security numbers of approximately 1,500 taxpayers were inadvertently disclosed when the IRS routed the stimulus payments to the wrong bank accounts. Olson also blamed the lack of participation of more than 5 million seniors and veterans on their lack of access to and experience with computers and the Internet, as well as a belief by some that the filing process is too cumbersome and complicated. "I think there are some natural barriers to getting some folks to want to file a return again," she explained.	1
Heads of 35 African nations observed two minutes of silence Sunday to honor more than 70 people killed in terrorist bomb blasts in Uganda earlier this month as the African Union summit opened. "Our condolences go to the  family members, friends and communities," the African Union said in its statement.The African Union also expressed solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo after another two people died after a bomb attack outside the Democratic Republic of Congo Embassy in Cairo.The African Union General Secretary Moussa Faki Mahamat said the death was a tragedy for all the people who died and added that the AU will continue to work toward achieving peace and stability."We mourn with the families and people of the victims and the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo,” he said in the statement. “I would like to extend our condolences and solidarity to the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.”The statement went on to say members of the African Union and the Security Council will hold meetings in the coming days to discuss future steps to confront terrorism and violence.On April 3, four people were killed in a bomb blast outside the residence of the Ugandan Ambassador in Cairo.Ugandan ambassador to Egypt was killed in #Uganda.

For those that love the luxury of first class air travel but loathe the imposition of having to share it with others, Emirates thinks it has the aircraft for you. The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new ute called the Alhambra, which will set you back a cool $100 million. It's only the start of a broader initiative that aims to make Emirates the new hub of airline travel.When Emirates opened this $100 million hangar in a cavernous former World War II bomb shelter in Burj Dubai, it also showcased the Alhambra, which is a full-size pickup truck and is equipped with three private bedrooms that are accessible only via the passenger-side rear cargo door. Although the Alhambra is an executive-level vehicle, it looks and functions much like a regular Dodge Magnum, and it even has a pair of golf clubs stowed beneath the truck bed.We're still working on the story of this $100 million pickup truck.Alhambra's interior.Despite not having four doors, the Alhambra has enough room for eight passengers and has a full kitchen to accommodate all eight. At about 7,000 pounds, this is an extremely beefy truck.While the Alhambra is just one of several new vehicles that Emirates is introducing for the high-end business traveler, in this case the company is taking a page from the book of American car companies (GM, Ford and Chrysler) that have gone after the executive-level passenger market with cars like the Lincoln MKT and the Acura NSX. With its new A380 and the A380s STOL long-haul variants in development, Emirates has a lot of competition.With a new vehicle like the Alhambra, however, Emirates is in a position where it can charge a premium. The company has a reputation for building reliable vehicles that have the luxury features that can only come when your vehicle is built by a high-end car company like Mercedes or BMW.A passenger gets into the Alhambra.I've had the opportunity to drive the Alhambra.

Efforts to rescue a research crew aboard a ship stuck in ice off Antarctica stalled Thursday after sea ice conditions made a key element of the rescue plan risky, Australian maritime officials said. The rescue plan called for a iced-out ship, the Australian icebreaker Perth, to cut a hole in the ice and a research ship, the HOBE-II Antarctic Research Ship, to be lowered to the ship in an autonomous underwater vehicle, AUVs, once the ice was broken.Once the research ship was on board, the ship's engine would be shut down to leave the AUV free to operate on its own.But ice conditions Wednesday raised doubts that the icebreaker, which is stationed 400 miles away in the remote Australian island state of Tasmania, could reach the Australian ship in time to make the rescue attempt Thursday.Australian Maritime Safety Authority chief executive Andrew Leask told reporters that he was "closely monitoring" ice conditions off the coast of Antarctica and said he was concerned about the potential for bad weather to make the operation "unsafe and ultimately unsuccessful."The vessel will remain in Australian waters, and Maritime Safety Authority officials are assessing if it is prudent to keep it in place to ensure that the vessel can return to Tasmania if it is not able to reach the Antarctic research ship.But the difficulty of making the attempt was underscored by a message sent by the vessel's operator, Australian-based Australian Antarctic Division, asking that the vessel remain in Australia."We are not being abandoned without a fight," it said.Australia's Department of Fisheries and Marine Resource said the ship has been "travelling to and from Antarctica for several years. The research vessel has always been able to get to its destination and return safely to Australia."The vessel had been in the vicinity of a major Antarctic ice pack about 1,000 miles from Australia in February and has been in the region for several days since then.It was not possible to reach the ship by satellite because the satellite's sensors were locked onto nearby pack ice, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.However, it was possible for AUVs to reach the research vessel using a vessel equipped with a camera, radio transmitter and inflatable stabilizing lines.A video released on the group's Facebook page showed the Australian icebreaker reaching the ship's side Wednesday in a sea of floating floes, but it did not provide clear video	0
When you consider the array of public men who have been forced, in one way or another, to come clean on their bad behavior, the list is not insubstantial: a president (Bill Clinton), presidential candidates (John Edwards, Gary Hart), governors (Mark Sanford, Eliot Spitzer), senators (John Ensign, David Vitter). And that's just the top tier. The bar has been set -- and it's awfully low. And by the way, many of these men managed to crawl right under that bar and survive, even thrive. Eventually, they found there was just one way out -- owning up to their own shortcomings. Sure, it may have been due to legal pressure. Or political reality. Or both. But some discovered the public can be forgiving, especially if it believes you have something important to offer to the nation. Just ask Bill Clinton, now serving as philanthropist to the world. So now comes Herman Cain, accused of sexual harassment by four women. He calls the charges baseless and defends his integrity. His political campaign and supporters have gone into full damage-control mode, scrutinizing the women. All predictable -- and reflexive -- enough. But here's the rub: Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be "baseless." If he wants to get this behind him, how about getting the facts out? Give the association's board permission to release the results of their internal investigation, if there was a formal inquiry. Then, as they say, the truth will out. And there's another plus: The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts. And the public can decide for itself. It's not as if this predicament is new to us. Recall back in the day when Clinton was in the middle of the Lewinsky mess. Republicans were (rightly) outraged, demanding his resignation or impeachment. Feminist groups, by and large, remained largely on the sidelines or supportive of Clinton -- because he was, um, not a sexual harasser. Oh, and yes, he was good on their issues. Now the tables have turned. Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him, choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead. (We've come a long way, baby, in that some conservative women's groups are criticizing Cain's I-don't-recall defense.)	1
A Pakistani politician critical of U.S. drone strikes said Saturday that American authorities detained and questioned him at a Canadian airport. Imran Khan, a former cricket star, this month led a march to the border of Pakistan's ills, where he said he saw American planes flying weapons, ammunition, and other equipment across the border. The government has denied it is involved in such activities.The incident, in which Khan was questioned by two officials with the Canadian Border Services Agency, and which caused him to delay a flight home from Pakistan, is the latest salvo in a growing debate in Canada about whether to allow more U.S. drone strikes in the country.Khan said his wife, who lives in Calgary, made the trip to see him, but said she was questioned by Canadian officials as the flight was about to depart. She's now back in Pakistan, and has shared her story with CBC News in a series of interviews.Imran Khan's wife, who is also a Canadian, says she was questioned by Canadian authorities at the airport as he was waiting to depart. (CBC)"It's a national security issue, and I think it's being used as a pretext to target any Pakistanis who are in or around the border," he told CBC News in an interview from his home in Calgary."The U.S. president talked about drones. That's my perspective also, is that's a form of terrorism and terrorism is against humanity. So people, whether they are in Canada or not, should not live in fear like this."Khan was on a short flight from Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore into Ottawa from Toronto when he was approached by two men, who said they were with Canadian Border Services Agency."They asked me a lot of questions and they made me write my name and my details down," Khan said."It was such an embarrassing experience for me, my family and my whole country."Khan told CBC News that he was asked whether he had ever visited Pakistan. When he said yes, the men said he had missed two appointments."It was a long interrogation," said Khan on Saturday. "It was also told that I have missed a meeting with parliamentarians of Pakistan."The interrogation lasted several hours, he added, which caused him to miss his flight home."I will not miss a flight because of	0
John Travolta testified Wednesday that would-be extortionists threatened to go the media with stories implying "the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow." John Travolta's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16. Travolta testified for the second time in a case against paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater. The defendants are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas in January. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, entered the downtown Nassau courthouse Wednesday morning surrounded by security personnel. The actor took the stand appearing nervous, and he took a long, deep breath before beginning his testimony. Travolta told the court a longtime employee of his became upset after learning someone was demanding money of the actor in the wake of his son's death. The employee learned through the family attorney, Travolta said, that it was "in regards to a paper I signed in the Bahamas." In earlier testimony, one of Travolta's lawyers, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after the January 2 death of Jett, saying she had a legal client who had a document Travolta might want. Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified. Watch In Session's Ashleigh Banfield discuss case » The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because "he would not want his name tarnished in media,"  Maynard-Gibson said. Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his unresponsive son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said. In testimony last week, Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday.	1
Thousands of people are expected to march Tuesday in South Africa to protest a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. Zuma's supporters in the ruling African National Congress say the portrait is insulting and call it an attack on both the president and his party. About 15,000 people are expected to participate in the march to Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery, where the work was on display, according to the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The painting by artist Brett Murray, called "The Spear," is reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda posters. Red on one half and black on the other, the painting shows Zuma in a proud stance with his genitals prominently exposed. Attorney weeps as he argues for censoring painting The painting was defaced last week after a storm of protests and condemnation, the SABC reported. "We believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of ... President Jacob Zuma but are a clear and calculated attack on the ANC," the party said on its website. "We therefore again call on all South Africans, members and (supporters) of the ANC and our alliance partners to come and register their outrage at this insult and attack on our president and the ANC," it said. The Sunday newspaper City Press removed the image of the portrait from its website after the ANC threatened a boycott, but it complained Monday the ANC still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place. Democratic Alliance, the ANC's official opposition, said The Spear "was brilliant as a work of political satire, which is also why it became an instant icon." Calls for the painting's censorship, the party said, indicate a dangerous move away from the right to free speech. If he felt insulted, Zuma should have sued the artist rather than calling for the painting's removal, the Democratic Alliance said.	1
Over the past few weeks almost a third of all Americans headed back to classrooms -- from early learning centers to universities, as students and as teachers -- accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters. Or perhaps not. Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs. And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum. Among all these headlines resides a more quietly sobering fact: This year's high school graduates will be the first educated entirely under the No Child Left Behind Act. In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting "I don't know" is a crime. But the problem isn't simply with a narrowly conceived educational policy. Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom. It's pervasive throughout our culture -- a reality at once daunting and hopeful. Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change. Hopeful because it means there's something every one of us can do about it. Maybe even starting today. I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face. For most of us, the fear of not knowing -- of looking dumb -- gets ingrained when we're small and reinforced throughout life in ways both subtle and overt. For every time someone reassured us, "There's no such thing as a stupid question," weren't there ample experiences -- on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom -- that convinced us otherwise? Anyone who's ever been reprimanded or ridiculed for revealing ignorance knows all too well: The taste of shame is bitter and lingering. We'll go to great lengths to avoid it, often without deliberate thought. How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others?	1
The opposition party in Cambodia has rejected the results of the country's national election, which handed another win to long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen. The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) said Monday the weekend balloting was marred by irregularities, and demanded an investigation. Cambodians went to the polls Sunday. According to preliminary results released by the national election commission, the opposition won 55 seats. But the number wasn't large enough to unseat the ruling Cambodian People's Party, which won 68 seats. In a statement, opposition leader Sam Rainsy said a committee -- made up of representatives of the main political parties, the election commission and foreign election monitors -- should look into "all serious election irregularities." Once the committee issues its findings, political leaders from both sides will find ways to "redress the injustice done to the Cambodian people whose will has been distorted for too long," he said. Hun Sen has been in office for 28 years. Still, opposition groups were energized. The two main parties teamed up to form the CNRP, and hoped for strength in numbers: Enough votes to take over control from the ruling party. More than 9 million people were eligible to vote. The excitement bubbled over Friday when Rainsy returned home from exile in France. He left in 2009 to avoid prison on charges of spreading disinformation -- charges many considered politically motivated. International pressure led to him receiving a royal pardon last week. But he arrived too late to run for office. The national election committee said it worked hard to ensure the election was far. "In preparing for the election this year, we started in the middle of 2012," said Tep Nytha, the secretary general of the committee, ahead of the balloting.	1
The major tunnel between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was scheduled to reopen at 5 p.m. ET Thursday following a shutdown because of a bomb threat, Windsor police said. Police "fully inspected" the tunnel before reopening it, Windsor authorities said. The bomb threat led to traffic backups as drivers on both sides of the border were rerouted. Employees at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel received an anonymous phone call around 12:30 p.m. from someone saying there was a bomb in the tunnel, Sgt. Matthew D'Asti with Windsor police told HLN. Authorities were working together on both sides of the border to investigate and search the tunnel for any possible device, D'Asti said. Neal Belitsky, president and CEO of Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, said the threat was called in to the Canadian side. Authorities treated the matter "as a nonspecific, anonymous bomb threat," said D'Asti. The tunnel was evacuated. The tunnel is one of two international crossings between the cities of Windsor and Detroit. Traffic was being routed to the other, a bridge about two miles away. Approximately 27,000 to 29,000 vehicles pass daily through the tunnel, which opened in 1930. The Coast Guard said it set up a safety zone in the Detroit River in order to keep vessels away from the tunnel. CNN's Chandler Friedman, Devon Sayers and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.	1
A massive fire engulfed a newly constructed, unoccupied luxury hotel in central Beijing on Monday night as crowds watched a nearby fireworks display marking the end of Lunar New Year celebrations. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is unknown. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is not known and there were no reports of injuries, according to CNN staff members who were at the scene. The fire began about 9 p.m. and continued to burn an hour later. A plume of flames shot from the top of the structure as the fire quickly spread. iReporter Jean de Villeneuve lives about 200 yards (200 meters) from the fire and said she watched it for about an hour before firefighters got it under control. De Villeneuve, who is originally from France, said she was surprised at how close spectators were allowed to get before authorities established a perimeter. "I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire, and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures," she said. "If this had been the United States, you would think a perimeter would be secured, but there was nothing like that."  Watch flames devour the hotel » De Villeneuve said she and others were able to get within 60 yards of the fire. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 people in the area were evacuated, "traffic controls were imposed" on a major highway and authorities temporarily stopped subway service on a line serving the area. "Snow-like ashes fell as far as [half a mile] from the building and smoke eclipsed the full moon," Xinhua reported of the blaze in the capital's central business district.  See photos of the blaze » iReporter Fred Rice, a British national who lives in Beijing, said "the top of the building was exploding." "We weren't sure if it was gas canisters or what. It was a spectacular sight for sure," he said. iReporter Stephen Chaytor said he was walking home from work when he saw the fire.  Watch the hotel burn » "It was spreading incredibly fast. It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site -- that debris ignited very quickly," Chaytor said. "Fire took control of building [and] within less than 13 minutes, it went from small flames to being totally engulfed in flames."	1
As the world knows, peace can sometimes be fleeting. One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow. After scoring against the Thunder in the second quarter, World Peace was cheering his own shot when he hit the Oklahoma City guard in the back of the head, knocking him down. Watch the NBA.com video of the hit Harden was on the floor for several minutes, and did not return to the game after being diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Thunder. World Peace was ejected from the game and faces possible suspension. The Lakers won 114-106 over the Thunder in double overtime. "During that play I just dunked on (Kevin Durant) and (Serge) Ibaka, and I got really emotional and excited. It was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow," World Peace told reporters after the game. "I hope he's OK. The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden," he said. Hours later, World Peace tweeted that he watched the replay again: "Oooo .. My celebration of the dunk really was too much ... Didn't even see James ... Omg... Looks bad." Harden told ABC's Lisa Salters he had "a little bit of a headache." On Monday, the Thunder said Harden was undergoing testing. "Harden participated in a series of limited activities per NBA guidelines, but has additional steps that must be taken under the league-mandated concussion policy before he can make his return to the court," the team statement said. "He will be re-evaluated tomorrow and is currently listed as day-to-day." World Peace's act was called "disgraceful" by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest. "He has gone to such lengths to rehabilitate his image, and to revert back to this? He lost control," said Michael Wilbon, an ESPN analyst. Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.	1
Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians. Sri Lankan troops at Elephant Pass, the isthmus that connects north Jaffna peninsula to rest of the country. "It's an incredibly serious situation," James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. "We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone." Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. "Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track," Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. "This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," he said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. "The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. "They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had." Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. "This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk," Elder said.	1

While the eyes of golfing world were on rising star Rory McIlroy on Thursday, two surprise names claimed the first-round lead at the British Open. A tearful Thomas Bjorn overcame the recent death of his father to shoot a superb five-under-par 65 despite difficult early conditions -- then late in the day 20-year-old amateur Tom Lewis shocked everyone by joining him at the top of the leaderboard with a record-breaking effort. The duo share a coach, but apart from that their stories could not be more different. The 40-year-old Bjorn was able to tee off at Royal St. George's -- where he blew his best chance of winning a major title in 2003 after squandering a four-shot lead on the last day -- only after several players pulled out, including Tiger Woods and lastly Vijay Singh on Monday. Ugly and unforgiving: Why Britain offers golf's toughest test The Dane, 11 times a winner on the European Tour, has made the halfway cut just twice since his father passed away in May following a long illness, but at the windswept English links course he rediscovered the form that earned him two winning Ryder Cup appearances. "Dad meant a lot to me," the world No. 80 told reporters before wiping tears from his eyes. "He would have been very proud of what I did today. That's all I've really got to say about that. "Today was a massive step in the right direction for me. I have been finding golf extremely difficult but I did a lot of work with (coach) Pete (Cowen) yesterday and some things just started to make a bit of sense. "I don't know if I can keep this up for the rest of the week. The start-all-over process has taken a lot longer than I wanted to, but I suppose that's part of the process. Let's just say I have realized this year there's more important things in life than golf." Lewis has already tasted success at Royal St. George's, having won the British boys' amateur title there in 2009. His father Brian, a former tour professional, named him after five-time British Open champion Tom Watson -- who was one of the Englishman's playing partners, with the 61-year-old American ending the day equal 71st after a 72.	1

The hospital applauded when the girl was born. Many pregnant women had been evacuated to give birth after Typhoon Haiyan left Tacloban's medical centers in shambles, but the mother didn't have time. Neighbors brought her to a makeshift ikebana home on the outskirts of Tacloban. When her husband could bring himself to come visit her, she greeted him with a song.“I had not seen him for seven months, but I felt like family, so I sang and sang,” says the girl, who asked that her name be withheld because she's afraid of repercussions for her family.A medical team from the Philippine Red Cross arrived at the hospital the next morning, she says. “They had the first look at the baby, and they said the placenta was already calcified, so it was a dead woman,” she says of the mother's condition. “So they took the body to the morgue, and the morgue released her body as dead.”That afternoon the girl and her mother arrived back home with the remains of their daughter, where she had been placed for cremation.The local paper, the Daily Tribune, reports the girl's parents, in tears, received an apology from the hospital for the mistake.But the apology wasn't the end of the story. The girl's father, a prominent business and political figure in Tacloban, filed a case in the courts against the hospital, the Red Cross, and the officials who were responsible for the error.In a phone interview from his office, the father of the girl, Abad Jr., says he plans to press on the hospital for a public apology and compensation for his daughter's death.Abad Jr., says his wife and daughter were both evacuated to Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan. During his visit to the hospital after the quake, he says he saw the body of a mother who'd been brought in as a dead body during the evacuation. The following day, he says they learned of the error. He calls it a “cultural sin.”“When we arrived at the hospital, we went to the hospital to get the body of the mother. Our expectation was that they would take good care of her until her burial,” he says. “And when we saw the body of the deceased	0

The man who revealed that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA said that he was "extraordinarily foolish" to leak her name. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was a source of the CIA leak to columnist Robert Novak. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview broadcast Sunday that he did not realize Plame was a covert agent when he discussed her with syndicated columnist Robert Novak. Novak, a former CNN contributor, wrote the July 2003 column in which Plame was named as a CIA employee. He later cited his sources as Armitage and Karl Rove, then President Bush's top political adviser. Armitage said he had seen a memo that said Plame was publicly chairing a meeting, so he assumed her CIA employment was not a secret. "There was no ill intent on my part, and I had never seen, ever in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo," he said.  Watch Armitage explain why he leaked Plame's name » Blitzer asked Armitage if he "simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA." "Well, even Mr. Novak has said that he used the word 'operative' and misused it," Armitage said. "No one ever said 'operative.' And I not only assumed it, as I say, I have never seen a covert agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said. It was foolish, yes." Rove, who left the White House in August, has denied he was also a source of the leak to Novak. Plame's identity was disclosed shortly after her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, challenged one of the chief claims underpinning the Bush administration's case for the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons from the African country of Niger. In an op-ed piece for The New York Times, Wilson wrote that he had investigated the claim at the request of CIA officials and found it "highly doubtful" that any such transaction could have occurred, and he accused the Bush administration of having "twisted" the evidence for war. Neither Armitage nor Rove was charged with a crime in the leak.	1

Morocco's Interior Ministry said Thursday that three Moroccan suspects loyal to al Qaeda have been arrested in connection with last month's bombing at a popular Marrakech cafe, the official Maghreb Arabe Presse news agency reported. One of the suspects was described in the Interior Ministry statement as the main figure in the April 28 bombing that killed 16 people and injured 21, according to the MAP report. The ministry statement described the bombing as a terrorist attack. The bombing occurred around 11 a.m. at Cafe Argana in Marrakech's old city, which is designated by the United Nations' cultural arm as a World Heritage Site. Tourists flock to the old city this time of the year, and it is usually packed with stalls, storytellers and snake-charmers. World leaders, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, condemned the bombing. "The individuals were absorbed by jihadist ideology, and had allegiance to al Qaeda and had already made several attempts to join some of the hotbeds of tension, especially Chechnya and Iraq, before deciding to carry out terror in the homeland," the ministry statement said, according to MAP. The suspects learned on the Internet how to make the two remote-detonated explosive devices used in the bombing, the ministry statement said. The attackers chose Cafe Argana as the target because of its popularity, and dressed as tourists to access the area, the statement said. A preliminary investigation found remnants of explosive materials and tools "that had been discarded after the terrorist act," according to the statement. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat, Salma Abdelaziz and journalist Martin Jay contributed to this report	1

On August 24, a jury of nine in a California federal court handed down a ruling that sent shockwaves through the global wireless phone industry. Samsung, the world's largest phone maker, was found guilty of infringing on key Apple hardware design and software elements. Samsung got Apple's attention because of its size, but every Android device manufacturer now needs to consider potential exposure areas that could put them in the crosshairs as Apple tries to slow Android growth. The appeals game will surely play out over the next many months. In the meantime, consumers will feel the pain as devices potentially get more expensive and software changes begin to creep into their Android smartphones. If appeals rulings uphold the initial verdict, the mobile ecosystem as we know it will look very different in one to two years. This would be driven by fundamental changes in the look and feel of non-Apple phone hardware, changes to the Android mobile operating system and potentially the emergence of a third popular mobile operating system. Smartphone market changes coming Android phones account for 56% of the U.S. smartphone market. Friday's ruling was very sobering for the Android device manufacturers that have driven this growth. Until recently, smartphone design patent ownership seemed like a gray area. The court has now made it clear that, in fact, it is very black and white. All phone manufacturers will need to be a lot more careful from here on out when it comes to design, and patents they want to avoid, license or partner on. This could result in phones being more expensive for consumers. Over the next year, consumers lose in this equation. Android phone makers will be scrambling to develop temporary workarounds to steer clear of any potentially infringing Apple patents. The time spent working on these fixes will reduce time spent on development of new, innovative features. In the case of Samsung, it is likely the only device manufacturer with the resources and scale to develop and implement fixes rapidly, mitigating the immediate impact on consumers. If there are other phone makers in Apple's sights, they will be taking advantage of a much-needed head start to begin developing workarounds now to avoid a lawsuit. Sure, Android consumers could always turn to Apple, but some are turned off by the company's one phone per year release schedule and continued hesitancy to incorporate the latest mobile advances such as 4G and larger screens. Consumers who want to stay in the open and highly-customizable Android ecosystem could experience some temporary frustration. Creating the next iconic device	1
While Spain wallows in the doldrums of economic despondency and political turmoil, with youth unemployment at eye-watering levels and Catalan separatists threatening to tear away at the country's seams, there is one place Â« the people of Andalusia Â« are keeping hopes alive Â«by Ben O'Sullivan"Life in Andalusia is tough and there is a lot of suffering, but we do not despair - and that's not because our life is easy, but because it's hard. The struggle is the only way of life and we are making all the sacrifices, because we know that the battle is worth it! The battle is worth it, because we will be successful! We will win !"That is the kind of message delivered at the start of a series of meetings on the economic future by the Andalusian Association of Youth and Students.The Andalusia Youth & Students Association, which had their first meeting in Cádiz in the summer of 2012, has now held 21 meetings and is currently planning their thirtieth, which they will be holding in the beginning of July in a small community at the edge of the Algarve."This organization is a response to the crisis and we need to unite the people of Andalusia", explained Jose Miguel Pacheco, one of two Andalusian presidents who are meeting with the youth. "The Spanish economy collapsed in the first half of 2014 - and in Andalusia, there is a terrible problem with unemployment: more than 10,000 young people without work and who are in a permanent state of crisis. Â« We will not come out of this crisis that Spain is in without united action of the people and without unity of the Andalusian political class - we cannot expect anything different from the political class !"The purpose of the meeting will be to inform and educate the youth of the challenges and the solutions that they are facing and to ensure that they take the necessary measures to get themselves out of the current financial crisis."We need to fight against the feeling that the only way is to surrender and submit to the system - that's a lie, we cannot do it", added Pacheco.

An arrest in which several punches were thrown has triggered an accusation of brutality against Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police from the mother of the 18-year-old honor student who was taken into custody. Police, in a  statement Monday, called the incident a "mutual verbal argument" that is under investigation. A police department spokesman, Lt. Steve Lehner, said the woman had complained to police and the department. "It appears the police took no action that might have escalated the situation." The statement did not comment on allegations that school administrators and the girl's family agreed to release the boy from the police station so he could be picked up, at least for the time being. In the arrest report the boy was charged with simple assault and harassment. "The girl has asked that we protect her minor brothers from witnessing what appears to be a beating by the police," the statement from the police department said. "She has been advised that the police department will not tolerate such behavior and that when she is arrested and taken to juvenile court, she will be returned to school." A statement by the Police Department also said charges of simple assault and harassment would be upgraded to aggravated assault.A Philadelphia police officer was arrested on a single charge of simple assault after he was accused of punching and kicking a woman who had complained to officers at a gas station over the weekend. Police Officer Charles "Buddy" Jones, 45, of East Falls Church, was charged Monday night with simple assault, saying a woman had become angry after he asked for a cigarette. Jones, a four-year veteran with the department, served in a patrol unit before being promoted to the detective division. He was suspended without pay last month. His lawyer said Monday night that Jones had been suspended for 30 days following an internal investigation. The woman, 24-year-old Laura Lee Brown, said Jones had become agitated when she called police and asked him about a possible cigarette machine. When she told him he was being recorded, she said he became upset and walked away at a traffic light in the 2600 block of East Market Street. She said two other officers called her and she hung up on the second call and decided to go to the police station. She said he shoved her hard, breaking her glasses. She said police called for an ambulance, but Brown was not taken to a hospital. She said police said she was bleeding from the nose and was taken to the Montgomery County jail. Brown told officers her nose was bleeding as well	0
Thousands of athletes and many more spectators have gathered in London Wednesday for the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games, set to be the biggest ever held. Over the course of the 11-day event, some 4,280 athletes from 165 countries -- more than ever before -- will compete in 21 sports, with more than 500 gold medals up for grabs. The opening ceremony, titled "Enlightenment," features a cast of more than 3,000 adult volunteers, 100 children and more than 100 professional performers, as well as the traditional athletes' parade. Five-time U.S. Paralympian Scott Danberg has been selected as flag bearer to lead the 227-member U.S. Paralympic Team into the Olympic Stadium, in east London. The Paralympic flame will be carried into the stadium to light the cauldron at the climax of the show. The torch set off on a 24-hour relay Tuesday evening from Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, the birthplace of the Paralympic movement, and reached London Wednesday morning. Thousands of people lined the streets to see the Paralympic torch relay wend its way through the capital on its way to the Olympic Park. The torchbearers included Paralympians, people who have overcome disability to achieve their goals and local heroes nominated by their communities. The relay route passed many iconic London sites, including Westminster Abbey, London Zoo, Tower Bridge and Abbey Road, where the torchbearers recreated the iconic Beatles album cover shot. The Agitos, the symbol of the Paralympic Games, has replaced the five rings that were suspended from Tower Bridge during the Olympic Games. And excitement levels are again rising in Britain and worldwide, with more than 2.3 million Paralympic tickets sold and huge numbers around the globe expected to watch the events on television and online. "The Paralympic Games have come home to Britain -- and it will be the biggest Games yet, with more athletes, more countries and more spectators than ever before," said Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. "The talent, commitment and inspiration of the Torchbearers, and ParalympicsGB, reminds us all what can be achieved when we focus on what people can do, rather than what they can't."	1
The new Roman Catholic archbishop of Seattle, J. Peter Sartain, was installed Wednesday afternoon with a Mass in the archdiocese's cathedral, amid ongoing controversy over Sartain's ordination of a priest who later  denied the allegations made by two of the three women who accused him of sexual misconduct. After the Mass, the bishop was introduced to a small crowd of reporters who were waiting outside the cathedral to take the new archbishop's statements and photo assignments.In an interview, Archbishop Sartain said that he would "take a deep breath" and that he wanted to "make it known" to the church community that he is "determined that the church will not be the victim of sexual violence in the future."Asked about the issue of how he could remain silent while a woman who had accused him of sexual assault made it into the news, Sartain said he was praying for her and for the community of survivors, and that it would be up to civil authorities to decide what questions the church must answer."I pray that God will let her find peace and forgiveness and that the church will be able to respond and respond in a way that is positive and helpful and that we help others in a more positive way," he said.Among those gathered outside the cathedral was the Rev. Brian Lally, a leader in Seattle's Catholic Church sexual-abuse scandal whose organization has been designated a hate group by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Lally, who is married with children, made a brief statement outside the cathedral."I am a Catholic and I support the church and the archbishop," he said. "But I am also a husband, a father, a son, and a brother. I am not here this morning to make a statement about who I am or where I stand, I am here because this church and these people were so good to me, from the very beginning."He later tweeted that he had given statements to the police, the state attorney general and, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries. "Some of these statements were false. Some of these statements were not truthful," he wrote.Sartain's first question to reporters upon entering the cathedral was what he would like to tell the church community that he, too, had been confronted with as they prepared to celebrate Holy Mass:"I am here to tell you that I am	0

A Colorado woman is being pursued as a "person of interest" in connection with phone calls that triggered the raid of a Texas polygamist ranch, authorities said Friday. Rozita Swinton, 33, has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the Texas raid. Texas Rangers are seeking Rozita Swinton of Colorado Springs, Colorado, "regarding telephone calls placed to a crisis center hot line in San Angelo, Texas, in late March 2008," the Rangers said in a written statement. The raid of the YFZ (Yearning for Zion) Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, came after a caller -- who identified herself as a 16-year-old girl -- said she had been physically and sexually abused by an adult man with whom she was forced into a "spiritual marriage." The release said a search of Swinton's home in Colorado uncovered evidence that possibly links her to phone calls made about the ranch, run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "The possibility exists that Rozita Swinton, who has nothing to do with the FLDS church, may have been a woman who made calls and pretended she was the 16-year-old girl named Sarah," CNN's Gary Tuchman reported. Swinton, 33, has been charged in Colorado with false reporting to authorities and is in police custody. Police said that arrest was not directly related to the Texas case. Authorities raided the Texas ranch April 4 and removed 416 children. Officials have been trying to identify the 16-year-old girl, referred to as Sarah, who claimed she had been abused in the phone calls. FLDS members have denied the girl, supposedly named Sarah Jessop Barlow, exists. Some of the FLDS women who spoke with CNN on Monday said they believed the calls were a hoax. While the phone calls initially prompted the raid, officers received a second search warrant based on what they said was evidence of sexual abuse found at the compound. In court documents, investigators described seeing teen girls who appeared pregnant, records that showed men marrying multiple women and accounts of girls being married to adult men when they were as young as 13. A court hearing began Thursday to determine custody of children who were removed from the ranch. E-mail to a friend	1
It's probably been a few years since you packed your books and lunch in a bag, kissed your mom at the door and stumbled off to grade school. But if you've got a friend traveling to Japan, you might soon find yourself slinging an old-timey book bag over your shoulders. Randoseru, Japan's traditional schoolchild's backpack, has become the latest must-buy souvenir in Japan. The randoseru is a mandatory item for first-year elementary school kids in Japan. Made primarily of leather, the simple, boxy backpack is known for its sturdiness and is usually expected to last a student through his or her first six years of school. Its popularity among foreigners gained traction earlier this year when Zooey Deschanel was spotted in New York sporting a red randoseru. It's not the first time Deschanel's taste in backwear has spawned an unlikely trend. In 2012, she was seen wearing a Fjallraven rucksack -- a hipster schoolbag brand from Sweden -- and a fashion mini-wave was born. Randoseru sales up In addition to becoming a topic of conversation on talk shows in Japan, the photo of Deschanel and her randoseru made the rounds on the internet. In April, Yorozu and Nagomi souvenir shops at Kansai International Airport in Osaka began stocking the bags in response to a sudden and unexpected demand from tourists. Yorozu tells CNN that the shop now sells about 120 randoseru each month. Chinese and Taiwanese parents and grandparents are among the biggest buyers, but travelers from other countries have been snatching them up, as well. Seiban, a randoseru manufacturer, has also seen an increase in foreign shoppers at its randoseru shop in Tokyo's Harajuku area. The company says it's considering hiring more foreign-language-speaking staff to accommodate the demand, according to the Japan Times. Randoseru typically cost between $120 and $600. How long the randoseru trend lasts is anybody's guess. Probably at least until Deschanel is spotted toting her stuff in an egg basket, toolbox or whatever's next.

The worst kept secret in Formula One is finally out -- Fernando Alonso is leaving Ferrari and will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel. Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015. After ending his five-year stint at Ferrari, Alonso remains coy on where he will be driving next season. The double move by two of the sport's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season. But in the fickle world of F1 there are no guarantees it will work out for either of the ambitious racers. There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. With the curtain about to fall on the 2014 season at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, hopeful drivers have just one more chance to stake their claim for the remaining seats. Where will Alonso go? Alonso is regarded as the best all-round driver currently racing at the elite level of motorsport, a fact many of his peers are even happily willing to acknowledge. The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market. The 33-year-old made it clear he wanted to leave Ferrari, even though he had two years left to run on his contract with the Italian team, but he has yet to confirm where he will go next. A return to McLaren seems most likely, despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as Lewis Hamilton's teammate in 2007. McLaren is about to embark on a new phase after reigniting its relationship with engine manufacturer Honda. Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success. Keeping the media guessing about his future -- and maybe his future employers too -- seems to have provided Alonso with plenty of sport off track. Speculation in the media has seen Alonso linked with buying the Lotus team, joining forces with German sports car specialists Audi and even ousting Nico Rosberg or Hamilton at Mercedes. Alonso remained typically tight lipped about his future plans when he was questioned by the media at the Abu Dhabi season finale. Has Vettel made the right decision? Vettel has endured his worst season at Red Bull in 2014, failing to win a race compared to three victories for his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo.	1
Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths. Barack Obama? This time, he couldn't overcome a weakness he has shown before, a tendency to ersatz earnestness that is supposed to help him connect with the public. "I am the only candidate who says he's going to meet with people on the night of the debate...you know, a little bit of civility. You know, a little bit of respect." He's right about the respect part, but wrong about civility. He's saying that they, meaning his supporters, don't actually like people like him, that he's not a nice person. He can't deliver on that, because he doesn't care whether it is received well or not. He's pandering, he's pandering so much that he can't see why it is working.In reality, the people who went to the debates had the impression that Barack Obama was a nice guy, and Mitt Romney an asshole.I know some of them. They said so.I don't like Romney and I think that he really, truly does hate America and people like everyone who hates America and thinks that they are superior to everyone else. He's a liar, which may be okay for a liar, but it's a very bad characteristic for a president, especially under circumstances when lying to the American people may be the only way he can survive. He knows that he has a problem with this, but he's been so afraid of that problem that it has blinded him from doing all that he could to fix it. Now, with the help of an election, he has the chance to fix it. And in any case, I have to admit that I was impressed at the level of discourse that occurred on Thursday night in the debate. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than I expected.That said, it's good that the people who attended the debates felt the same way that I did, and that they liked Obama far more.Obama was clearly in the zone, going from tough to caring and back to tough and caring in a single sentence. But the zone didn't last very long and we saw a lot of angry talking points from Romney. He went after Obama's health records, saying that he had been treated for a "severe form of diabetes." And, as if to remind Obama that he can't deny everything he has	0
I'm one of those people who won't throw out electronics just because they're outdated. If a device is still working and potentially useful, I'd rather get it into the hands of someone who will continue to use it. And even when devices are broken or useless, I can't bring myself to landfill them -- I save them up for local electronics recycling drives. But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them. I bought a Droid Incredible last month. Since then, my two-year-old iPhone 3G has been gathering dust on my dresser. That iPhone served me well enough for a long time, and there's nothing really wrong with it. I'd love to pass it along to someone who wants it. ...Well, OK, there is one thing wrong with it: a few months ago I made the mistake of updating its operating system to iOS4, which drastically slowed its performance. (Cult of Mac, Wall Street Journal and many other venues are reporting the same problem.) This problem apparently is reversible, but not easily so -- and I just don't feel like trying. I've got many more pressing concerns. My phone's iOS4 performance problem is severe enough that I would be embarrassed to give this phone as a gift to anyone I know, or even to sell it directly to another party via Craigslist or eBay. So I found a middleman to shield me from embarassment, keep my old iPhone out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time. I'm selling my old iPhone -- as is -- to Gazelle.com, a "reCommerce company" that says it provides "a practical, responsible, rewarding way for consumers to get value for used electronics." In less than a minute Gazelle.com agreed to buy my old iPhone for $93. This week they're sending me a box to ship it to them, and after they've checked out the phone they'll PayPal me the money. (I'll report back if that part of the process doesn't work as promised.)	1
When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula One team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit. Kimi Raikkonen said last week that he decided to leave it and rejoin ÂKÃ¶hlert Racing for the 2014 season."I can't give up on it, I can't give up on my career," he told ÂForce magazine. "I made some mistakes, and I made some good ones. Now I'm going into this season with more confidence, I have a good team, and I want to make up for some mistakes I made last year. This year, I might be more focused."I know how to drive a car and I know how the team works. Last year was a difficult year for me, and I was not focused on the team. If you stay focused on the car and the team, and work hard and try to drive the car as well as you can and take the next step to be at the highest level, then you will make the steps you need to reach the very top. So let's see what happens this season."Raikkonen has been joined in the team by 2012 world champion Felipe Massa, and 2012 champion Pastor Maldonado is also expected to be part of the team as a new driver.The announcement of the new driver lineup for the 2014 season follows a meeting between the team and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, on Monday. The decision to split the Lotus program was made at the June meeting, and Ecclestone told The Times on Tuesday that new drivers would be considered.Although Raikkonen has not confirmed his future at Lotus, he was quoted by ÂForce magazine as saying: "Yes, I will be back; no, I will not be back. I will be back at my previous performance level."I am not talking about my comeback; I am talking about my new beginning. I want to be known as a great driver again. I want to be back with Kimi Raikkonen and be at his best. I want to be back with one of the most important teams in the world. We have a new car and with a new driver as well, and I want to be part of an exciting team like this. But I have to make sure I am at my best."We don't have	0
New Year's Eve," a schlock ensemble love-o-rama timed for the season of easy good feeling, is a movie I often found myself laughing at in ridicule, and one that also gave me a lump in the throat. So I guess you could say I had a good time. The movie, like last year's "Valentine's Day," was written by Katherine Fugate and directed by Garry Marshall, and I can just imagine Marshall showing up on the set to basically shout seven words: ''Action!'' ''All right, everybody, overact!'' ''Okay, cut!'' If you had to pick the cheesiest subplot, your head might explode. Is it Jon Bon Jovi as a rock star trying to win back the fiancÃ©e he dumped -- a superchef played by Katherine Heigl, who looks as if she can barely slice a pineapple? Is it Ashton Kutcher as a smirk-aleck stuck on a grimy elevator with an agonizingly sincere backup singer (Lea Michele)? Is it Hilary Swank as a Times Square exec who saves the dropping New Year's Eve ball from mechanical failure? (She calls...Kominsky! A repairman with funny Russian accent!) Or is it Robert De Niro as a dying man with a bucket-list wish so wispy that the entire anecdote seems designed to let De Niro shoot his scenes in less than an hour? "New Year's Eve" is dunderheaded kitsch, but it's the kind of marzipan movie that can sweetly soak up a holiday evening. EW.com rating: B- See the full article at EW.com.

Pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine have decided to go ahead with a Sunday referendum on greater local powers, they said Thursday, defying a call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone the vote. Putin had urged the pro-Russia sympathizers to  delay the vote until next spring at the earliest, citing violence from separatists after they seized a government building in Donetsk on Tuesday.Putin's refusal to postpone the vote led the Ukrainian government on Wednesday to urge Russia to send troops to protect the Ukrainian border. Both Russia and Ukraine will decide on the consequences for each other. Russia has said Ukrainian troops would invade its ally eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine has said it would do so as well if necessary.Putin had asked pro-Russian separatists to delay the vote, but his request was rejected by the head of Donetsk regional council Andriy Parubiy, said Oleksandr Turchynov, a separatist leader in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, in a video posted on Twitter.He appealed for "help" from Russia, which is backing separatists against Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine, to prevent the Sunday referendum to turn Donetsk into an autonomous province, or republic. Parubiy said in the video that he had sent an appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin for help and warned that the vote would not be held if Russia did not intervene."All the separatist regions, all the regions of Ukraine, will gather on Sunday, they all will gather on Sunday... We are going to hold the referendum. This is our choice we made over 70 years ago. For us the referendum is an issue of life and death, it matters to us ... we will definitely hold the referendum. And our hands will be tied," he said.He said separatist forces could not prevent the vote. "We cannot stop the Russian army from being there, we cannot stop the Russian army from entering Ukraine," he said. "And we cannot force them to enter."He called on the Ukrainian government to respect the referendum and called on Moscow to intervene "in a timely manner" to stop the vote from going ahead.But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday it was too late for Poroshenko to appeal to Putin, as the referendum was already planned. Peskov said it was too late for Poroshenko to send the Russian president a letter. He said Putin had instructed him to remind Poroshenko to get a letter from the president of Ukraine telling him to postpone the vote	0
Rarely has an animal birth been more hotly anticipated but the equine answer to the Royal Baby has taken its first tentative steps at the home of racing, Newmarket in eastern England. On Sunday, Song produced the first ute of foals from her two-year-old mare, Song. The baby's father is the gelding, Sombre, and Song will be bred with the mare's sire, Sultanside.The foal's mother is thought to be the filly, Almond. Song's first foal, Song, is expected in August, two months ahead of schedule.Song's first foal is not her first equine offspring. When Song first foaled Almond at Newmarket in July, Song was the dam of a foal the previous year, who debuted in the Listed Grade 1 Fillies' Handicap.Although Song is expected to produce Almond's foal, the foal's sire, Sombre, will be bred first and then Song will produce the next foal."She's just got a huge heart," said Almond's proud mother, Yvonne, who has been in the sport for decades. "I just love horses and she is a really lovely horse. She's easy to look after and she gives you nothing but love and when she comes out of the stall and you're not with her, she's got that amazing smile on her face,"Yvonne says. "I feel she is my little angel. She loves everyone, everyone loves her. She is my baby and I love her to bits. She just has a way about her that is like a little kid."Almond has a long pedigree for success with Song and Sombre. The two-year-old Almond and Song produced Sultanside, winner of the Listed Fillies' Handicap in the 2009/10 National Hunt season, and Sombre, a National Hunt winner in the same year.A year after Song's first foal, Song was the dam of a filly, who debuted in the National Hunt Listed Fillies' Handicap a month later. Song has since produced two fillies in her two-year-old season.In April, Song also produced her second foal a week later. Song produced another filly in 2008 but her	0
Rony Delgarde immigrated to the United States from Haiti with only $5 and a Bible. The first thing he saw when he landed at Miami International Airport were all the colorfully painted buildings. "People paint their house yellow, white, red, blue and I said, 'Wow, there's so much paint in this country!'" Delgarde says." I said, 'When I get money in this country, I'm going to buy paint and take paint back home.'" From that idea, Global Paint for Charity was born. Delgarde, who is 38 and works as a health care consultant, states the mission: "to recycle leftover paint from businesses and residents, processes it and then donate it to vulnerable families in developing countries all around the world." Delgarde explains the process for making paint in Haiti. "We cut down trees and we started fire. We pick out rocks from the river and we put it inside the fire and close the fire for a week. And once it's done, it's a wonderful powder." He points out that this type of paint washes away in the rain. Delgarde's nonprofit organization wants to make a lasting difference. Two years ago, Delgarde started going to construction sites in the Atlanta area, asking them what they did with their leftover paint. He told them, "I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint. We'll give them paint and we'll change their lives. That's when I started collecting paint." The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that approximately 10% of the 637 million gallons of paint sold annually is left over, equal to about 64 million gallons per year. So far, Delgarde has donated 6,000 gallons of paint to projects in Kenya, Haiti and Uganda. He recently returned from Equatorial Guinea, where he donated 200 gallons of paint to an orphanage for children who lost their parent to HIV/AIDS. "We looked at schools, hospitals, family homes and they were not painted. It really touched my heart to see the bacteria on the walls that were not painted. I said we have to do something," he says. Those looking to donate their leftover paint can visit the website of the group, GlobalPaints.Org, and fill out a request for a pickup.	1
In the 100 years since British army officer T.E. Lawrence traversed Jordan's desert and the half century since David Lean set out to capture it for his cinematic epic "Lawrence of Arabia," the blood red landscape that entranced both men has scarcely changed. Still "vast, echoing and God-like" -- as Lawrence wrote in his account of his war experiences "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" -- the desert's hidden gems are now accessible to all. Today, Jordan is one of the Middle East's safest tourist destinations and plays host to an endlessly varied landscape. Fifty years since the film crews left, following in Lawrence, and later Lean's, footsteps can still reveal some of Jordan's finest desert jewels. Wadi Rum When Lawrence, as a junior officer, was first sent out into the desert to locate the Hashemite rebels who he would join in revolt against the Ottoman Empire, he found himself in a vast gorge, where red rock monoliths rose more than 800m into the air around thin sand corridors. He was inspired to write of the granite and sandstone cliffs "sheering in like a thousand-foot wave towards the middle of the valley." In the south of modern day Jordan, 300km from capital city, Amman, near the border with Saudi Arabia, the landscape appears unchanged from the scenes described by Lawrence -- the same landscape which Lean used as the backdrop for the Englishman's first encounter with Alec Guinness' Prince Faisal -- in what is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Click on the pindrops above to trace Lawrence of Arabia's Jordan. All photos courtesy Jordan Tourism Board The natural wonder remains awe-inspiring, says travel writer Matthew Teller who authored the Rough Guide to Jordan: "It's a very evocative place, the sound is echoing off the walls around you, you're looking up and down this broad desert canyon with sun coming down and the blue sky above." The desert dunes Lawrence's masterplan of leading an army across the arid brick-red sand of the desert to launch an attack on the coastal town of Aqaba -- an idea considered so perilous that the Ottomans had not bothered to defend against it -- became his defining act.	1
Toward the end of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's surprise appearance at the TED Women conference Wednesday, she told the story of a girl and her father in a developing country. "This teenage girl's father expected to force her into early marriage, but she had been to school and she received a cow, perhaps through the Heifer project,  to encourage her to stay in school. When her father demanded she drop out of school and get married, she said no. When he insisted, she insisted right back. "And finally she pulled out her trump card: 'If I leave and get married, I'm taking my cow, that cow belongs to me.' So guess what. She stayed in school, she was spared an early marriage, all because her father couldn't bear to part with the cow." TED.com: Sheryl WuDunn on oppression of women Clinton devoted her talk to the importance of empowering women and girls around the world, and the audience of 700 at the International Trade Center responded enthusiastically. "Let women work and they drive economic growth across all sectors. Send a girl to school even just for one year and her income dramatically increases for life, and her children are more likely to survive and her family more likely to be healthier for years to come. Give women equal rights and entire nations are more stable and secure. Deny women equal rights and the instability of nations is almost certain." Clinton said the goal of empowering women and girls is a "central tenet" of American foreign policy. "Women's equality is not just a moral issue, it's not just a humanitarian issue, it is not just a fairness issue," she said, "It is a security issue, it is a prosperity issue, and it is a peace issue. "Therefore when I talk about why we need to integrate women's issues into discussions at the highest levels everywhere in the world, I'm not doing it just because I have a personal commitment or because President Obama cares about it. I'm doing it because it's in the vital interests of the United States of America." Clinton said the status of women will be a key part of a new document the State Department is planning to release this week. Modeled on the Defense Department's review every four years of U.S. defenses, the "quadrennial diplomacy and development review" will assess American foreign policy.

The Justice Department charged Toyota with wire fraud on Wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration. According to an agreement signed by the Japanese company, Toyota executives responded to initial complaints about sticking gas pedals and unwanted acceleration by deceiving the public and trying to find ways to limit damage to its global brand. Toyota at one point boasted internally about saving $100 million in costs by avoiding a full safety recall. That strategy continued even after a 2009 incident in which a family of four in San Diego was killed when their Lexus suddenly accelerated to speeds of 100 miles-per-hour and crashed, Justice Department officials said. Toyota wound up recalling millions of popular vehicles in 2009-10. Attorney General Eric Holder said Toyota "confronted a public safety emergency as if it were a simple public relations problem." The financial penalty is the largest for a car manufacturer and Justice Department officials said it represented an aggressive new strategy to deal with how companies handle safety recalls. Under the agreement, the Justice Department will defer the criminal charge for three years, during which Toyota will submit to government monitoring. The settlement ends a four-year probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, which is now looking at safety issues at General Motors. GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month. George Venizelos, FBI assistant director in charge of the bureau's New York office, blasted Toyota. "The disregard Toyota had for the safety of the public is outrageous. Not only did Toyota fail to recall cars with problem parts, they continued to manufacture new cars with the same parts they knew were deadly," he said. According to the agreement, Toyota admitted to deceiving U.S. safety regulators and members of Congress who conducted a separate inquiry. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the company's deception even raised concerns among employees. Bharara noted that one employee, in January 2010, said in response to the company's misleading public statements: "Idiots! Someone will go to jail if lies are repeatedly told. I can't support this." Christopher Reynolds, chief legal officer for Toyota Motor North America said the company has made changes to be more responsive to customers.	1
While many now recognize the scientific explanation for a solar eclipse, the phenomenon is still marked with tradition and sometimes suspicion in Hindu-majority India. People test the "sky watching telescope" at the Gujarat Council of Science City in India. The "exceptionally long" eclipse that will cross half the planet Wednesday will be able to be seen by virtually all of the population of China and India. For beggars in India, the occasion means an extra day of receiving alms and food. The panhandler in Sandeep Jaggi's neighborhood normally visits the block every week on Tuesdays and Saturdays, as well as the days of a new and full moon. And because his patrons mark an eclipse with alms-giving, prayers and bathing, he rarely misses the chance to meet them on this day as well. "It's a family tradition and I follow it," says 34-year-old Jaggi. He will fill the beggar's small steel pail with mustard oil and coins and his disheveled sash with lentils. For others in the country, the eclipse is not a reason to celebrate, but a more ominous phenomenon. Send us your photos of the eclipse Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse. "None of the expectant mothers under my treatment are willing to have deliveries on Wednesday," Shivani Sachdev Gour, a gynecologist at New Delhi's Fortis La Femme hospital, told CNN. In fact, there are critically ill patients who do not want to be in the hospital on the day of the eclipse, she said. Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when this celestial event occurs. "It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality," said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a "remedial astrologer." A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere. "Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power," he explained. About 1.5 million people are expected at one such pond -- the Brahmsarovar, or the pool of Hindu god Brahma -- in northern India on Wednesday.	1

Rob Sellard's young wheat field is a stark reminder that no matter how bad the economy, farmers are always at nature's mercy. Rob Sellard and his wife, Sylvia, farm 14,000 acres, or about 22 square miles, in  upstate New York — a region where water is scarce and growing conditions and seasons can be anything but predictable.For the most part, their fields are dry and rocky. Winter wheat tends to suffer from the drought, says Sellard, who grew up in the Catskills. But the growing season isn’t over, says Sellard’s son, Tim, a fourth-year doctoral student at Cornell University. After the sun sets, they’ll get to work planting cover crops to help stabilize soil and prepare for new crops in the spring.Farmers like Sellard in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York have been struggling with a decade-long drought that has caused the number of farmable acres in the region to fall by more than half.Rural economies are in deep economic trouble — they were almost entirely built on small-scale agriculture. But farmers like Sellard are beginning to adapt, finding new and innovative ways to make a living from the land that have not only saved them, but are helping to rebuild their community.“We’re still feeling the effects,” says Sellard. But the longer the season remains, “the better it is for the whole region.”Forget the long-gone farm days when farmers could count on a steady supply of fresh, free-flowing water at planting time. New York is no exception to the national trend. As of 2012, the state ranked No. 1 in water issues, with more than two-thirds of the state’s land — some 13 million acres — in either the drought or the floodplain of the Susquehanna River.But the Finger Lakes’ history goes back much further, says Tim Sellard, Rob’s son. The region, which is home to some 4,000 farms, is the birthplace of the nation’s first U.S. governor — William Bradford of Westchester County — and its first sitting U.S. senator — Samuel W.

Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev is set to lose half his wealth after being ordered to pay his former wife $4.5 billion in a settlement dubbed the "most expensive divorce in history." Elena Rybolovleva's lawyer Marc Bonnant said the order from a Geneva court was unprecedented, and "this record judgment is a complete victory." However, Rybolovlev's spokesman Sergey Chernitsyn said the divorce was still a "win" for the oligarch. The two had been battling over the settlement for six years, after Elena Rybolovleva, the oligarch's wife of 23 years, filed for divorce. Rybolovlev's total wealth is estimated at $8.8 billion, according to the 2014 Forbes list of billionaires. He made most of his money from the $6.5 billion sale of his stake in Russia's largest potassium fertilizer company in 2010. Rybolovlev is also known as the owner of the Monaco Football Club, which plays in the top French soccer league. Rybolovlev made headlines when he bought the Palm Beach Maison de L'Amitie from Donald Trump for reported $95 million in 2008. In 2012, the Rybolovlev's then 21-year-old daughter Ekaterina bought Manhattan's most expensive apartment -- the penthouse on Central Park West which cost $88 million. A trust set up in Ekaterina's name also reportedly own Scorpios, the Greek island where Jackie Kennedy married the former owner of the island, Aristotle Onassis, in 1968. The oligarch's lawyers will appeal against the decision, questioning the sum. "There will definitely be a new appellate review and therefore this judgment is not final given the existence of two levels of appeal in Switzerland," said Tetiana Bersheda, Rybolovlev's lawyer.

About 250 people raced across the Syrian border into Turkey, government officials said Saturday, a flight that reflects the fear and violence gripping the Arab nation. The people hustled to the southern Turkish Yaylidagi district in Hatay province on Friday afternoon, according to local and federal government officials. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal said the government is trying to determine more about the people and how and why they chose to leave Syria. "They just came to the border post and want to go in without passports. They were let in," Unal said. "We are trying to figure out whether this is an individual event or the tip of the iceberg." Yaylidagi Mayor Mustafa Kemal Dagistanli and another local government official, who asked not to be named, said the people are Syrian citizens and Muslims. The local official said most of the people are ethnic Turkmens, and three of them speak Turkish. Most of them are from Qamishli, in the northeastern region, and Latakia, on the western coast. The official said the people say they've been persecuted by the government of President Bashar al-Assad -- now locked in confrontation across the country with anti-government protesters. "The group is mostly young, there are women and children among them," the official said. "They are in good health condition. There are no health problems."

It was a typical practice day for the Washington University of rowing team, but then danger came from beneath. The scene was Creve Coeur Lake outside of St. Louis early Friday morning. The team's boat got near the dock, when suddenly a swarm of Asian carp emerged from the water and went on the attack, some even going into the boat. Team member Devin Patel described the moment of terror: "The fish was flopping on my legs. It was so slippery that I couldn't get a grip on it." Patel screamed at teammate Yoni David, "Yoni, get it off me!" Thankfully, no rowers were injured during the ordeal, but the strong smell of fish lingered in the moments afterward.

In the first few days after the Sewol disappeared beneath the Yellow Sea, divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage, bringing the dead home. And throughout the following days, weeks and months, Park Eun-mi waited to see if one of them was her 16-year-old daughter, Huh Da-yun. The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor. The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast. "We kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter. I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'" Park said. A year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found. "We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014," said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. "I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people." Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved. On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn. Passengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out. Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel. Divers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families.	1
The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go. A urn containing Zelaya’s remains was briefly placed inside the embassy on Monday before being removed with a policeman present. The whereabouts of Zelaya’s remains have been a source of controversy in the country ever since his ouster by his own military on July 28.MORALLY RESPONSIBLE, OR NOT A LAWYER? – “The Constitution of Honduras says it is the president’s responsibility to ensure the security of the government. That means that the president is responsible for the security of the embassy’s personnel. The president is also responsible for the security of the nation. That means that the president cannot just walk into a meeting with a group of embassy personnel and fire them. It would be the equivalent of taking someone with government documents into a parking lot and firing them. Clearly, that would be a violation of the Constitution,” said U.S.-trained lawyer Jorge Rivera.FINDING THEIR WAY – Despite the confusion surrounding the whereabouts of Zelaya’s remains and his reappearance in the last few days, members of the press corps remained respectful, offering their own interpretation of the events that took place at the Embassy. A Honduran reporter for The Times described the scenes outside the embassy as “peaceful,” while another for Honduran newspaper, La Prensa, described the scene as “an almost festive atmosphere.”A CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT – “I have always taken responsibility for the security of the United States embassy in Tegucigalpa. I never turned off the water,” he said. “I was elected and have been president and re-elected president of the republic of Honduras. I do not believe that the people who were inside the embassy on Sunday were under any obligation to leave. The embassy is a national representation of the government, and there is no law that requires that the people at the embassy, members of the diplomatic service and foreign service, go home. On Sunday, the president of the republic of Honduras, Mr. Zelaya, went to the national representation in the embassy and asked for the ambassador to help him in his quest for power. As far as I know, he	0
Sony blamed the global economic slowdown, increased competition and an appreciating yen for a 95 percent drop in third-quarter profits, as the company announced its results Thursday. Customers check Sony's Bravia brand LCD TVs at an electronics shop in Tokyo, Japan. Profits for the quarter, which ended December 31, fell from nearly 200 billion yen ($2.2 billion) in 2007 to about 10 billion yen ($110 million) in 2008. Across the company, sales were down 25 percent, but electronics and games sales were especially hard hit. Sales of games, including the company's popular PlayStation series, fell 32 percent over the year. Sales of electronics decreased by nearly 30 percent. The appreciation of the yen also cut into profits. A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive or forces companies to lower their profit margins to keep prices the same. Last week, Sony warned that it will close out the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with an operating loss of 260 billion yen ($2.9 billion), its first in 14 years.

The federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown, as House Speaker John Boehner told a group of fellow GOP legislators that he won't let the nation default on its debt, according to a House Republican. Boehner Â told lawmakers that when the government is unable to pay its bills, he would not let it hit the $85 billion a year that was demanded by the Democratic-led U.S. Congress.This means that the federal government that is not paid will not go off the credit cards and into the bankruptcy courts.Forget the debt ceiling, Boehner told members of the House Budget Committee, who all attended an event at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on Wednesday. Instead, he said he would cut the deficit in half if not eliminate it entirely."I've said it multiple times before, the debt ceiling is not the only concern we have as a Congress and as a country," Boehner told the group, according to Politico."If they (the Democrats) believe that by raising the debt ceiling they're going to scare the world into being more transparent to their demands, they are very much mistaken. And I don't think we're going to be that easy to scare," Boehner told the group. "I don't think our country is that susceptible to that threat."Boehner's comments come days after President Barack Obama publicly indicated that if the nation didn't act immediately to lift the debt ceiling, that the nation would run out of cash and would go into a default. And just last week, the Pentagon announced that it would not be able to pay its bills for two months.Democrats, however, have said the debt ceiling is not in the way that the current government shuts down, according to Politico."There really is no connection between what's happening in Congress and the government going down," said Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. "This is a Republican problem. Boehner is a Republican problem. As for the president, he is a Republican president."The federal government may not be hit with a double whammy on top of the ongoing shutdown, as House Speaker John Boehner told a group of fellow GOP legislators that he won't let the nation default on its debt, according to a House Republican.

One person tweeted, "@KelseyGrammer, your hashtag #KelseyGrammerGrammar is the best thing ever (notice my correct use of your, not you're)!" Even other celebs are chiming in on the fun. "Star Trek" legend William Shatner tweeted, "Uh oh! Dad showed up. No more fun anymore. ;-) @KelseyGrammer @twitter." So watch your p's and q's, people. You don't want to make Sideshow Bob mad.	1
Four current and former employees of Britain's Sun newspaper were arrested by authorities investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police, News Corp. and police said Saturday. Police searched the men's homes as well as the East London offices Ã¢â‚¬â€ located in the same building as Sun News Digital and the London tabloid publisher's headquarters Ã¢â‚¬â€ early Saturday morning in a search that included a dog. Three of the men, including former Sun News chief executiveeditor Nick Hopkins, are due to appear in court in connection with the police bribery investigation Sunday, according to authorities.A U.S. appeals court on Friday denied to hear a dispute over control of the Internet giant, but the court's action was unusual, with a panel deciding the issues without hearing from the two sides and just hours before the court is expected to rule on a similar dispute involving Google Inc.

An expanding digital marketplace, financial stability and strong economic growth; Estonia is setting the pace for other European nations, according to the Baltic nation's leader. Speaking with CNN's Isa Soares, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the country developed a reputation for its digital economy "from a level playing field" with other nations after it gained independence in 1993. "We did, in the 1990s, look around us and see a lot of things that we needed to do in the world," he said. "We were behind in many areas. When it came to IT... we were starting more or less at the same base as everyone else. We started with a tabula rasa, a clean slate."

He added: "Our e-governance solution, banking, private sector... are more secure and quicker." With the lowest government debt in Europe, Estonia's economy is also a beacon for financial prudence at a time when many European nations are struggling to cope with high government debt and low growth. Read more: Spain's booming Rioja economy Asked why Estonia is the poster child for economic stability, Ilves joked: "Well, for one, we followed the rules." He added: "It is quite clear that if the eurozone is to be viable, that the kinds of behavior that we have seen, either fiscal irresponsibility, or in some cases even lying about deficits, well that is completely unacceptable."

Today, the Baltic nation is joining its affluent Nordic partners in financing the struggling countries of southern Europe.	1
A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said. Four others were wounded when the man began shooting outside a home Sunday afternoon, police said. "This was part of a property dispute," Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Monday.  "Due to a death in the family, there was a dispute over who owns the property, and who has rights to it." The shooter, Charles "Zeke" Sponaugle Sr., had been living at the property recently, Geller said. The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said. Believing the situation had been resolved, the deputies left the home. But shortly before 5 p.m., authorities received another call about an active shooting at the residence, said Maj. Donnie Lowe of the Louisa County Sheriff's Office. When officers arrived, a man was shooting at people in the front yard. Two people were killed and four were wounded, said Sgt. Thomas Molnar of the Virginia State Police. The man then directed his gunfire at police and released a pit bull terrier on them, authorities said. "Based on evidence at the scene, as soon as deputies arrived they were in an active shooting situation," Geller said.  She said authorities believe that return fire from deputies killed both the suspect and the dog. No deputies were wounded. "Since 2000, deputies have been to this property 23 times," Lowe said. "The calls were pretty much all the same -- family arguments, people not getting along -- nothing really violent, mostly verbal." He added, "You can't predict something like this." The four wounded people were taken to the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Molnar said. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.	1
Syria was plunged Wednesday into a nationwide blackout, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. A "terrorist attack on the gas feeder line for a power plant" in southern Damascus led to "power outages in all provinces" and efforts were under way to restore it, Electricity Minister Imad Khamis told SANA. Syrian activists were posting video to social media accounts showing what they described as a gas line fire near the Damascus airport. The video showed unidentified buildings in the dark, with a fire burning on higher ground behind the structures. And the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a large explosion rocked Damascus late Wednesday. The blast targeted a government checkpoint and injured soldiers there, the London-based activist group said. In London on Wednesday, at a meeting of the "Friends of Syria," the head of Syria's main opposition umbrella group laid out a list of conditions for participation in a conference to be held by the end of the year in Geneva with the goal of ending the bloodshed that has wracked the country since March 2011. Ahmad al-Jabra, leader of the Syrian National Coalition, said they include: -- releasing prisoners; -- lifting the siege from affected areas and allowing the entry of aid; -- stopping the use in civilian areas of ballistic missiles, cluster bombs and fighters jets; -- the departure from Syria of Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces; -- the renewal without conditions of ex-pats' Syrian passports; -- a commitment from President Bashar al-Assad to implement the provisions reached in the first such conference, dubbed Geneva 1; -- a declaration by al-Assad to accept a transition of power to an interim government body with executive powers, written in the constitution; -- an agreement by all sides that the transitional government is the sole source of legitimate law in the country; -- an agreement that the U.N. Security Council will guarantee any agreement under Chapter VII of its charter, which would allow military action; -- a timetable for the transition; -- stipulation that those responsible for war crimes against humanity be removed from power and held accountable. British Foreign Minister William Hague told reporters Wednesday that al-Assad should play no political role in Syria. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least 33 people were killed Wednesday across Syria. State-run SANA said at least 10 people were killed in "terrorist" attacks in Damascus and Aleppo. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report	1

German Chancellor Angela Merkel fractured her pelvis in a skiing accident in Switzerland over the holidays, her urn was discovered Monday in the Swiss Alps, her office confirmed .A spokesman for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party said the urn was found Monday morning in a village about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from the German capital. He would not give further details on the origin of the urn or say whether the contents have been identified.The accident happened at a speed skier event in the northern province of St. Moritz on Dec. 27, where Merkel's party is running for re-election the following week.A spokesperson for the Christian Democratic Union party said in a statement that Merkel, 65, was skiing with her youngest child, a son, at the time."It is a painful and sad day for us," the party said. "We can only draw comfort from the fact that she is in stable condition and will recover."Merkel has been on her feet since her accident, which occurred on her second try, and was being treated at the local hospital, according to the party. Her office said she has been kept sedated, and she will remain in a hospital for several days.Merkel, leader of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), is seeking re-election next week in a vote, likely to be held in early January, that will be crucial to her party's performance in coming years.With Merkel's coalition government now the junior partner in an agreement between the conservative Christian Social Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, her party holds only a slim majority in parliament.The party needs to get into parliament for the new government to pass laws, and for a majority of its members to be re-elected in an election in September.The latest accident follows another in July last year, when Merkel suffered a broken leg while visiting her sister in the Swiss Alps.A statement from the hospital in Aufstetten, Switzerland, that operated on Merkel said she was "stable" and undergoing physiotherapy, but that she suffered broken bones in her lower body.The accident prompted the SPD to name Merkel as its next presidential candidate in an election due in September. Merkel has been serving as party leader since 1998.If Merkel wins the election, she will have to resign as party leader in late April and will not	0
Marilyn Edge was supposed to turn over her son and daughter to her ex-husband in Georgia. Instead, police allege, she fled with the children to Southern California and killed them. On Saturday night, the bodies iced-over in the crawl space of her home in Irvine were found. The bodies were identified through dental records in the medical examiner’s office, as well as fingerprints taken when the bodies were first discovered.Marilyn Edge’s ex-husband, James Custer, was charged with six counts of child murder and another child abuse charge. Police also said he sexually assaulted a third child and that he abused the children because he didn’t want to share custody.The case underscores a question that has been on everyone’s lips: How many deaths caused by a divorce could there be, and what percentage of them would be caused by issues of trust?Divorce is becoming increasingly more common in the United States, and one often-bickering state has the most divorces: California. In 2010, 43 percent of California marriages ended in divorce; in 2017, that number had increased to 52.1 percent, according to a recently released state report. There were 9.5 divorces per 1,000 people in 2017, the highest in the country.This is especially true for the Hispanic, Asian and black population, all groups historically viewed as vulnerable. The number of Hispanics and Asians entering into marriages declined by more than 75 percent between 2000 and 2010. People of color were more likely to enter into a second, third and fourth marriage, with the rate of second marriages in 2010 being nearly double the first.The consequences of these divorces are often dire. Children of divorce are at greater risk of poverty, and divorce can lead to children being trafficked or having their families turned against them in court.There is one silver lining, however: The more children of divorce that are born, the less likely they are to become violent or substance abusers as adults, according to a study from Cornell University published in 2016, which found that “divorced” teens were nearly twice as likely as those raised in a married household to be violent, and that nearly 10 times as many “divorced” teens (12.6 percent) were classified as “problematic drinkers” in a survey conducted in 2011.But with divorce being more	0
A superb goal from Mesut Ozil on the hour mark saw Germany go through to the last 16 of the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Ghana at Soccer City on Wednesday night. The victory also secures Germany's passage as Group D winners and they will now play England on Sunday in Bloemfontien for a place in the quarterfinals. Australia beat Serbia 2-1 in Nelspruit but the effort was in vain as Ghana go through as the second qualifier on goal difference. They are the first African team into the the knockout stages and will face Group C winners the United States on Saturday in Rustenberg. U.S. and England qualify in Group C Ozil's superb volleyed strike into the roof of the net gave Joachim Loew's men a deserved victory after having the better of the play, but Ghana also chances in Johannesburg. In the first half, Andre Ayew looked set to score as he burst into the Germany penalty area, but he took one touch too many, then Ozil was one-on-one with Richard Kingson, but was denied. Germany captain Philipp Lahm knocked an Asamoah Gyan shot off the line as the teams went in scoreless at halftime, but his team were to eventually triumph. Coach Loew said he had a word with Ozil in the dressing room about his earlier miss and never doubted he would make amends. "I told him in the half-time break -- you've still got a goal in you," he told AFP. "This was an incredibly intense game and not many things worked out for us. But ultimately we have now reached the next stage. "The round of 16 game (against England) will be a class encounter, we are looking forward to it." Australia 2-1 Serbia Serbia only needed a point in the other match to go through, but were undone by a fighting performance by the Socceroos at the Mbombela Stadium. Two goals in four minutes midway through the second half from Everton midfelder Tim Cahill and substitute Brett Holman gave Australia hope they they could also qualify. But Serbian substitute Marko Pantelic pulled one back with six minutes left, had another ruled off for offside -- the second of the match for his unfortunatle team -- then shot over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Serbia also had strong penalty claims denied as Cahill appeared to handle in his own penalty area.	1
Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village. Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health. It is where Hu Xiaoping, a husband and father and a farmer, died an agonizing death at age 30 one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer. His widow, Zhu Chun Yun, blames his death on the brown and rust-colored water from the river, which farmers use to irrigate their crops. "The doctor in the hospital told us not to live here," she told CNN through an interpreter. "He said don't eat the rice and don't drink the water." Residents of Liangqiao say their river is polluted because of the iron-ore mine about 35 miles away, which is run by a nationally owned company. Mining for iron-ore exposes naturally occurring heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium, which are both carcinogens. Without proper water treatment facilities, water contaminated with high levels of these metals is hazardous and can possibly cause cancer. Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades. "I always had a dream to live in a place where there's a clean river I can swim in, but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in China now," she said. Twenty-eight people in this village of 400 have died over the last 10 years from cancer -- a rate much higher than the rest of country. The overall mortality rate for 2006 was 137 deaths per 100,000 residents. Pollution is a serious problem throughout China. The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country. China, along with the United States, is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which experts say can contribute to global warming. In terms of total emissions, China is projected by the International Energy Association to become the world's leading greenhouse gas producing country this year. It can also impact the U.S. food supply. The amount of food imported from China has grown dramatically in the past decade. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006. In 1995, it was $800 million.	1
The only sound Christian Myers heard in his classroom at Arapahoe High School was the constant buzz of vibrating cell phones -- calls from panicked parents trying to reach their children. The sophomore and ersatz cowboy, who had played a lot of video games at age 16, didn't know about the mass shooting at the school or any of the other tragedies.This article is a guest post by James, a student at Arapahoe High School in Pueblo, Colorado.The day before Christmas, the 16-year-old, who did not want his last name used, walked into his classroom and found the front door open. The students, some of whom were dressed in Santa hats or bibs, all ran outside. He asked his fellow students, "What's going on?" They told him.Arapahoe High School was on lockdown that morning after a shooter in the student's home opened fire on teachers and students. After the lockdown ended, the students gathered in the school's cafeteria. As the morning went on and students came back into the cafeteria, Christian Myers heard gunshots."I hear the door open and people run through the doors and then it was like that was like an alarm going off and then when people were coming in the cafeteria I heard about 15 or 20 shots," Myers told NBC News.Myers, who was eating breakfast with his family in the cafeteria on the morning of Dec. 26, turned, looked out the window and saw someone at the door. He dropped his food, grabbed his wallet and his phone and headed to the door. "As I was getting out the door, I looked back and two shots rang out and that's when I turned to my family and said in the middle of breakfast, my teacher died," he said.The 16-year-old did not know that Christian Myers would not live to see him graduate from Arapahoe High School. Myers, who had a full scholarship to Colorado State University, was one of the students who went to the school's counseling center and heard the shooter's voice on the speaker. It was the first time he heard his own voice."I heard the shot and I looked at the door and saw a guy standing there, so I called my parents, I said I need help," Myers said. "They said to me, 'No, no, no, go back inside because we	0
Move over, Emma. There's a new queen in town. Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual  "Newborn Name Watch" report.The Social Security Administration issued the report Monday to show which names had the strongest birthdays from 2000 to 2009 and which were the most popular for the year.So far, there are 11,000 new names every year in the U.S., and the latest report shows that there's been a significant jump, about 250,000 more names than during the previous year."Now we're going into our sixth year of our Newborn Name Watch," said Social Security Administration deputy inspector general Charles T. O'Neil.O'Neil said a lot of the increase is attributed to a baby boom, with more children born each year compared to previous years. He said the Social Security Administration has seen an increase in births since 2000, with the number of children born each year having doubled since 2000."We're definitely seeing more people," O'Neil said.The Social Security Administration's report was based on birth certificate information collected from hospital records.About 3 million names were born in the United States in 2008, and the number has since increased by nearly 300,000.O'Neil said the baby boom may be contributing to the increase, noting the name Bessie is one that started to outnumber Emma.O'Neil said he's not surprised by the increase in the number of names. Each year, the Social Security Administration checks about 11 million name combinations in the U.S."It used to be that people would give the baby a name from the 'book' of a favorite person or place," O'Neil said.In 2008, there were 1.3 million names listed nationwide in the Newborn Name Watch. About 600,000 were names used by girls born on Dec. 31 in the U.S.O'Neil said the Social Security Administration has not released the report for 2010 yet, but he expects to be able to report the results by the middle of the year.	0
Molly Haskell will always have brotherly love for Ellen Hampton. After all, Hampton was once named John Cheves Haskell Jr. and used to be Haskell's brother. Until 2005, Hampton lived as John -- or, as his ersatz father, Kenneth Hampton -- after Kenneth's mother, Molly Jernigan Haskell, died.But things came crashing down for Hampton in 2005, when Cheves Jr. died and was buried in the Haskell family plot. Cheves Jr.'s obituary began, "Kenneth "Cindy" Compton Haskell IV passed away peacefully on December 13, 2005 in Pasadena, California."And that was the last anyone heard of the real brother she thought she had buried. As is the custom, Hampton continued to write fake obituaries of Cheves Jr., pretending he was still alive. That's what she writes in the current obituary for Kenneth Hampton."Kenneth "Cindy" Compton Haskell IV passed away peacefully on December 13, 2005 in Pasadena, California. He was born February 15, 1971 in Philadelphia, Pa. He is survived by his mother, Molly Jernigan Haskell, his father, Kenneth Haskell, his brother John Cheves Haskell, III and sister, Mary Kate Haskell.

Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of "Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith" and "Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America." Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says issue of Obama's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists. (CNN) -- The YouTube video of an out-of-control woman yelling and screaming at Republican Congressman Mike Castle's town hall meeting in Delaware, demanding to see the birth certificate of President Barack Obama, is utterly hilarious. To watch others cheer her insanity, and then boo the congressman who says the president is an American, shows you that we have a serious problem with mental illness in this country. The nut jobs that continue to promote this story are wacky, right-wing radio and TV talk shows hosts and no-credibility bloggers. They have latched onto this story like bloodsucking leeches, and actually want us to believe this story has legs. Last week, in a suit filed by perennial presidential loser, Alan Keyes, they even tried to claim a court victory after a federal district judge in California asked to listen to the merits of their case. I'm sure he simply wanted to see for himself how delusional they are. From the moment President Obama entered the race, he has had to endure the so-called flag-waving American patriots who think they are the arbiters of what's right for the country. What cracks me up is that in order to justify their loony beliefs, they say, "The president could just end this once and for all by producing the birth certificate." Do you actually believe these wackos will stop there? They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate. The next thing you know, one of those nut job right-wingers in Congress -- and yes, there are left-wing nut jobs as well -- will demand a federal investigation into the production of the birth certificate. During the presidential campaign last year, the issue of whether Barack Obama was a "natural born citizen" legally qualified to be president was scrutinized by reporters and researchers who concluded that Obama was born in the United States.	1
She's been called "America's mom." Strangers stop her for hugs in the airport. And she still dishes up kindly parental wisdom daily in reruns of "The Brady Bunch." "Brady Bunch" actress Florence Henderson founded a service to help older adults learn about computers. Now, actress Florence Henderson, otherwise known as Mrs. Brady, has a new mission: Helping older adults learn to use technology. Her new business, Floh Club, is a "telephone-based technical support service" focusing on people who didn't grow up with computers -- especially grandparents who want to stay in touch with family but are intimidated by webcams, Facebook, instant messaging or even e-mail. Henderson says Floh Club is "like roadside assistance for your computer." She spoke with CNN's Josh Levs about her inspiration, her grandkids and "Brady Bunch" rumors as the show celebrates its 40th anniversary.  See more of our chat with Florence Henderson » CNN: What made you think of this? Florence Henderson: I was terrified of computers, Josh. I didn't grow up with them. And I have four kids, and they were always saying, "Oh, Mom, please get connected." And I would go, "No, I don't have time." But I was really scared. And so, a few months ago I decided that if I felt that way, there must be a lot of older adults that feel the same way, or maybe even some younger ones. I am now sending e-mails, I'm videoconferencing. I'm taking photos off my camera and actually putting them on the computer. Facebook, it is so exciting. I mean, I'm thrilled. CNN: What kinds of calls are you getting? What have people been calling and saying they need help with? Henderson: Things like as simple as learning how to send an e-mail. We have all North American-based technical experts standing by. Eighteen hours a day. Seven days a week. They are all very patient and very caring, and they will access your computer remotely, and they will talk you through any problem you may be having. They'll teach you how to use your computer. CNN: The plans and services range from $25 to up to $250 for an entire year. You have grandkids. Do you stay in touch with them this way?	1
He says it's his last fight. And it's been his hardest. After 43 years in Congress, New York Rep. Charlie Rangel said the campaign for his 23rd term is his final one. The 84-year-old "Lion of Harlem" wants two more iced coffees for the road."I'm happy to say I have a plan for getting re-elected. There's no sense in me running for office unless I know I'm going to win," said Rangel, a former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the powerful Ways and Means Committee's ranking member. On top of that, the Democratic-leaning New York City district's demographics won't change, Rangel believes. But the man who started his political career as a member of the U.S. Steelworkers, working alongside Martin Luther King Jr. to organize the steelworkers' union, believes he's got one last trick to play. If he loses, even a close loss, in a New York City Democratic primary, he'll spend the next year and a half fighting to keep his congressional seat, he vows.Rangel spent the last decade of his life in the U.S. House of Representatives, beginning with his election in 1983. He represented New York's 14th district, covering Harlem, the Upper East Side, a piece of Brooklyn, and Long Island, from 1991 to 2013. In 1993, he became co-chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, and was the chairman until his retirement in 2013. A longtime vocal liberal, he was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus.Rangel has never been an activist or much of an activist's activist. He was a lifelong Democrat but never gave up his seat to run in the Democratic primary — at least not until 2014, when he launched an insurgent campaign against U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel with TV ads alleging "a pattern of corruption at the highest levels of the New York State and Federal government." He lost, losing his seat to the more moderate, and more conservative, former U.S. Rep. Bill Owens.The reason Rangel is so keen to keep his seat, he says, is two-fold. First, he believes a victory would be a political turning point in America, one that would have major national reverberations. Second, he believes a loss would be a huge loss for his city, and he'd rather	0
The misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. An employee at the étudiante center, where he worked as a keeper for one of the group’s primates, may have taken a break from his regular cleaning duties to help an animal on the research unit, the agency said. The patient became ill after the employee rubbed the ill primate’s genitals with his bare hand. The employee used the same type of gloves he would use to clean other primates to clean the patient’s genitals, the CDC’s report said. The employee, who has not been identified, told investigators he could not recall cleaning his gloved hand with soap or washing it with water. Instead, he said he washed it with alcohol soap, the report said. Bacteriophage, which are viruses that attack bacteria, are more transmissible than viruses that cause more common diseases like the common cold and flu. The report comes at a time when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing a pair of medical devices that have been linked to transmission of a bacteriophage that attacks the bacterium that causes meningitis. FDA officials said the devices' manufacturers, Zimmer Biomet, could make changes that would make their products less likely to spread the bacteria to the public. FDA spokeswoman Barbara Carreno said Friday that her agency is aware of the report and that it is investigating the claims.Pinellas County sheriff’s deputies arrested a man after he was arrested for allegedly causing his girlfriend’s vehicle to collide with another, sheriff’s officials said.

The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go. A soldier takes a picture Wednesday of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Honduran forces also will not enter the Brazilian embassy, where Zelaya has been housed since Monday, de facto President Roberto Micheletti said in an interview with CNN en Español. But these developments do not spare Zelaya, who was ousted in a June 28 coup, from being arrested and facing charges for violating the constitution if he leaves the safe haven of the embassy, Micheletti said. "President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him," Micheletti said. The de facto president challenged versions of events surrounding Zelaya's return. Despite local reports citing police officials that authorities turned off the power to the embassy and surrounding area ostensibly to discourage looting, Micheletti said that a congregation of pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves. As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said. A nationwide curfew was lifted Wednesday, but a security cordon remained in the area around the embassy. Micheletti said that the police were there because the people inside the embassy requested the protection, and said, "We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody." Zelaya's announced return has re-ignited a stand-off between the two disputed leaders of Honduras. Brazil now finds itself involved because of its embassy. Brazil wants an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the situation, the official Brazilian news agency reported. In another development, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by presidential elections scheduled for November 29. But the de facto leader said in a statement read by his foreign minister Tuesday that his offer to talk with Zelaya does not nullify an arrest warrant issued against the ousted president by the nation's Supreme Court. "I think that what the whole world should understand about this country is that there is no immunity for anyone -- for anyone," Micheletti told CNN en Español. "And, no one can be above the law."	1
President Obama will place tariffs on imports of some Chinese tires for three years in an effort to curb Ã¢â‚¬Å“defeatÃ¢â‚¬Â of the Chinese tire industry by Beijing, sources familiar with the plan said Monday.A senior administration official confirmed that the president plans to impose a 25 percent subsidy for each tire that it makes an equivalent number of in the United States.The goal is to cut the amount of tires imported into the United States in order to reduce the number of imports, which in turn would lower costs to the United States.The announcement, which comes as the administration is in an effort to achieve a long-term trade deal with China, provides additional evidence that China has been the No. 1 target of the administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trade policy and could be considered a threat to the economy.On Sunday, during a debate on NBCâ€œs Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who is currently facing heavy criticism following revelations that he used a private email address to discuss government affairs while working as governor of Massachusetts, said he would not impose tariffs on imports from China unless Beijing takes steps to open up its financial markets to American business.The Chinese tire manufacturing industry is a big part of the United States economy, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total sales of the domestic tire industry. Some in the administration believe if China makes it harder for the United States to sell tires abroad, sales in China could decline and imports could fall accordingly.Meanwhile, the Chinese tire industry would face higher costs, which in turn could make it harder for China to sell tires to its customers.The United States has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum from China and South Korea in recent months in an attempt to curb their influence on the global economy.“If I were president, I would announce a 15 percent tariff on tires from China immediately,” Romney said Sunday, adding, â€œWe have to do everything we can to raise the cost of Chinese goods and lower imports.â€China is seen by many analysts as being in a race for a trade deal with the United States. Some economists say they do not expect China to make it.“They are not going in the direction that either the president or I want them	0
Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro weighed in on the Arizona mass shooting that killed Â©© Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesPresident Obama has made statements that some saw as encouraging dialogue and reconciliation with North Korea. For instance, Obama recently asked North Korean nuclear scientists to come to the United States "as part of an ongoing effort to address the nuclear threat of North Korea." But this is no doubt one of those moments when one has to carefully consider the context of such a statement. After all, North Korea has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States, and yet it also has been engaged in dialogue with the United States.The Obama administration has in the past tried to engage North Korea diplomatically. Indeed, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a state visit to North Korea in 2002, ostensibly to discuss human rights issues. But that visit also demonstrated an unwillingness by the Obama administration to engage to North Korea's actual demands. Clinton's visit was, as she would later say, "one of the most frustrating trips that I've ever taken." In his book From Cairo to Pyongyang, Jon Meacham, a former New York Times foreign correspondent, would write that Clinton and other top North Korean negotiators tried to create a framework of mutual respect, yet "failed because of the nature (of) this interdependent, two-way relationship." Instead of being a constructive effort, Meacham would write, the Clinton/North Korea "negotiations were more like a negotiation between two parties who can't agree to the best terms. The North Koreans, not having to deal with the United States, and with their own history of intransigence, would play their cards so relentlessly that they became convinced that the United States was so bent on provoking a war that it would not negotiate in good faith. In the end, the Clinton administration was forced to give up on the North Korean initiative."Yet again, there is a sense that Obama administration officials have simply given up on engaging and negotiating with North Korea. This comes at a time when North Korea is clearly re-establishing itself as a player in the global arena. Kim Jong-un is believed to be building a new military base on the Korean peninsula, and his country's leaders have shown themselves willing to conduct military exercises, which are not only threatening to the South Korean democracy and human rights activists, but also to Japan and Vietnam. This has been interpreted as a sign of their desire for a potential war with the United States	0
So many hours of talks, so little progress. Despite two days of intensive negotiations, Iran and six world powers "remain far apart" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday in Kazakhstan. Her words dashed hopes that the deadlock might be broken after what had seemed more promising talks back in February, also in the Kazakh city of Almaty. Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, acknowledged there was "some distance" between Iran and the six powers but seemed more positive in his assessment. "Good negotiations" had taken place in this round of talks, Jalili said, which he described as "substantive, expansive and comprehensive." But in a sign that progress was limited, no date or location has been set for new talks. This round was just the latest in a decade-long attempt to resolve differences between Iran and the international community over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The first day of talks proved inconclusive. By the end of Saturday, despite "long and intensive discussions," the two sides were no closer on agreeing on confidence-building measures, Ashton told reporters. "It became clear that the positions of (the world powers) and Iran remain far apart on the substance," she said. "We therefore agreed all sides will go back to their capitals to evaluate where we stand on the process." Ashton said she would be in touch with Jalili "very soon in order to see how to go forward." While Ashton said these were the most detailed discussions that the two sides had had, with "a real back-and-forward between us," she also made clear that she was disappointed by the lack of progress made. A senior U.S. administration official said Jalili directly engaged him in a 30- to 40-minute question-and-answer exchange in the middle of Saturday's plenary meeting. "The quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth, this Q and A," the official said. "We just went back and forth with him." Still, the official expressed disappointment, saying that Iran had "put forward some minimal ideas and expected great return, and quite disproportionate return." Britain, too, took a hard line after the talks. "The UK went to Kazakhstan ready with our partners to negotiate in good faith with Iran," British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. "Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough."	1
Just after Apple CEO Steve Jobs debuted the next version of his company's iPhone to the world, the tech luminary had a bit of technical trouble. "Well jeez," Jobs said, struggling to get the spanking new iPhone 4 to do much of anything without a connection to a Wi-Fi network. The technical faux pas came during Jobs' keynote address at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California. At one point, Jobs turned toward the audience and seemed to ask a question of one of his technical directors: "Got any suggestions?" he asked. "Verizon!" shouted an audience member, in reference to the fact that AT&T, the sole cellular network that carriers the Apple iPhone, gets notoriously bad reception in San Francisco. Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless. That didn't happen on Monday. The new iPhone will remain an AT&T-only device. It goes on sale on June 24 to AT&T customers for $199 or $299, depending on the amount of storage. Any AT&T customer eligible for a phone upgrade this year can get the iPhone 4 on its debut date at those subsidized prices, Jobs said. After the event, tech industry analysts warned against reading too much into the network glitches during Jobs' presentation. But, if nothing else, they do symbolize the growing frustration some phone consumers have over the lack of choice among wireless carriers. In a recent interview, for instance, Kevin Tofel, a blogger in the GigaOm network, said it is smartest for consumers to pick a wireless carrier first, rather than get the coolest phone. Otherwise, they're buying an "expensive brick," he said. Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network. "It's Wi-Fi," said Carolina Milanesi, research director for mobile devices at Gartner. "You had so many people in there using Wi-Fi. I didn't read too much into it." Of AT&T, she laughed and said, "It's not always their fault." Van Baker, research vice-president for Gartner, said the "Verizon!" comment from the audience was "totally unfair ... because it's not going over the 3G network." Jobs eventually resolved the issue himself.	1
A day after 20 million gallons of water gushed out of an old, broken water main, UCLA had quite a mess on its hands Wednesday -- and it still was trying to figure out how big. Hundreds of vehicles were waterlogged and stranded. A vernal pool was inundated. Some vehicles ended up on fire. And firefighters were dealing with an array of issues: a fire at an electrical transformer tower, a fallen tree blocking a back-up water main and a malfunctioning alarm in an electrical substation that sent the campus' main power system into gridlock.By Thursday afternoon, the fire at the electrical transformer tower was still burning, and the other problems were still being solved. The campus police department asked that people avoid using their cellphones for safety's sake. The fire department was investigating a possible second fire at a transformer in the west campus parking structure. And the campus fire marshal's office had yet to file any charges in the case of the man who suffered a heart attack after falling through a large pane of glass onto a busy sidewalk.That afternoon, a water main break flooded the vernal pool on the south side of Campus Loop, and water flooded through a parking garage, leading to a fire. And though UCLA officials told the Los Angeles Times in an email that the vernal pool was fixed by Wednesday afternoon, the pool was reopened only Friday.A team at the University of Virginia's Fire Science Institute analyzed the scene of the fire at the electrical substation Saturday afternoon. The panel found the heat and the smoke at the site were both highly unusual. "We don't have a lot of fire in a residential area on a summer day, so I'm surprised this is happening," said Michael Gassman, the institute's director.The Los Angeles Fire Department was investigating the electrical substation fire as well. The campus fire marshal's office told the Times on Thursday that the agency had no official timeline for filing charges in the case of the man who suffered a heart attack after falling through a large pane of glass."We've got to figure out how we're going to deal with the power disruption," said David Pecan, the fire marshal's office spokesman.The power problems are the latest to be plaguing the campus, which includes 3,000 students and more than 90,000 employees. The problems began last week when the campus lost water service, forcing the shut	0
If you're rich and want to give money to a lot of political campaigns, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that you can. The 5-4 ruling eliminated limits on how much money people can donate in total in one election season. However, the decision left intact the icky part of the Court's decision, known as the "Citizens United" ruling that says companies and unions can spend unlimited amounts in politics. So, if you're in Congress, you can, too."We're really pleased," says Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL). "For the first time we're taking their power away from special interests."The news has already caused quite a stir. The Obama administration, the ACLU and some other anti-corruption groups have already pledged to appeal the decision if they get funded. "We'll fight this decision," says Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). "It will take a full court hearing to resolve the constitutionality of this decision."But, if you're a liberal and you believe that corporations are a real scourge upon the people, then you can rejoice."Corporations exist for the good of the people, not the people for the good of the corporation," says Sen. Sanders (I-VT). "We are living in a country where the super-rich have more wealth than the bottom 80% combined. This ruling means that the big corporations will no longer be able to buy elections and take away our rights."Sen. Paul (R-KY) says, "The people were left on the ground, with no means of recourse against a president who has shown disdain and disdain for their rights."The question is, can this ruling be appealed and reversed?"I don't think it's likely," says Thomas Goldstein, a constitutional law professor at Columbia University. "The Supreme Court is bound by the Constitution by a higher law. But their power is very constrained by constitutional decisions already made by the court."But what about the Supreme Court's decision to uphold Citizens United? It was based on the Constitutional right to spend money."That is the law, no matter what anyone thinks," says Goldstein. "So, it is a matter of judgment which side of the constitutional fence is on the correct side and which side is on the wrong side."Goldstein says we'll have to wait and see what the Court says and says in	0
The New York City Opera needs $7 million in fundraising by Monday or it could be closing its curtains for good. On top of that money, the opera company wants to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 towards future seasons, according to a press release. "If we don't raise the ($7 million) by the end of Monday the board is going to begin the process of bankruptcy," spokesperson Risa Heller told CNN on Friday. The company started a campaign to raise $1 million of that $7 million through an online fundraising site -- Kickstarter.com -- that will end September 30. As of Friday the online campaign had raised only $202,223 donated from more than a thousand supporters. The organization raised $1.5 million outside of Kickstarter campaign, according to Heller. "The odds have been against us for a long time," George Steel, general manager & artistic director for the company, said in an online video, "but in the face of that difficulty we have made tremendous progress." The company, dubbed "The People's Opera" by former NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. Steel explains that in order for the company to break even, it would need to sell every ticket for $600, but instead the starting ticket price is actually $25 to make it more affordable. The New York City Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of work including Robert Ward's "The Crucible" and Anthony Davis' "The Life and Times of Malcolm X." The company opened its current season on September 17 with the opera "Anna Nicole," and should it fail to raise the necessary funds by Monday, that could be the Company's last production. "We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year," Steel said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. "We need you to come together and carry it forward into the future. I hope we can count on you." This year marks the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943, making it the second opera house in NYC. The Metropolitan Opera was founded over 60 years earlier, in 1880.	1
Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt. If enacted, the bill would add to a long list long list of reform promises going back at least  more than a decade.“This is a very strange bill which seeks to change the face of Syrian political life,” said one of dozens of civil society groups who signed a letter to the United Nations Secretary General to object to it, following a debate on the matter in Geneva.“It is just another example of the international community’s hypocrisy, its lack of political will and commitment towards solving Syrian crisis,” said the letter, signed by more than 40 non-governmental organizations as well as several Syrian groups.“We will not be used as a cheap means to promote ‘humanitarianism’,” said the letter. It calls for a “strong” diplomatic solution to end the fighting, which has claimed at least 300,000 lives, including at least 7,000 children killed since the outbreak of the civil war.The Syrian National Coalition, a coalition of opposition parties and exile groups, says the proposed law – which would require the registration of new political parties – is part of a “political agenda,” to prevent it from getting into the Syrian National Assembly.The law, expected to be approved by the United Nations Security Council, would be passed by a new committee that would be set up to check that anyone registered as a new party does not engage in illegal financing, propaganda, fraud or violence.The “SNC” says it has “no hesitation” about opposing the law, saying the government’s plans to try to change the face of political life is part of a wider political strategy.“In the past, the government and the opposition agreed to the principles and conditions for a political solution [and] for ending bloodshed and war,” said the coalition, which calls for a “political solution” in a UN statement released on the eve of the Geneva debate.“The proposal lacks the political will and is devoid of any substance to give the Syrian people a concrete choice,” said the coalition.The bill, which is still at the stage of reading, is designed to give the Assad regime the opportunity to “continue	0
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari completed his five-year term and stepped down as president  on January 17, 2013. During his presidency, Zardari was frequently criticised for failing to deliver on promises including the implementation of the 'Rape of Asia Policy' against militant and drug traffickers in his country. Zardari had previously dismissed the claim to rape the women of neighbouring, Pakistan.On February 14, 2013, Zardari met with senior opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who had criticized the handling of the 2013 election of PMLN-N chief Nawaz Sharif by then-Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. In a meeting with President Zardari, Nawaz Sharif asked Zardari to reconsider the decision to hold polls on September 23. In response, Zardari stated that:"No government in Pakistan could ever let its people down. The mandate of the people of Pakistan is for the PML-N government to continue in power for another five years, which is what we all wanted to see and which we had also discussed."After Zardari's inauguration as chairman of the Pakistan People's Party, Prime Minister Gilani announced his resignation.In 2014 Zardari was criticised by a section of his party which claimed that he was not sincere in fighting corruption and that the country's economy was in decline.2015 general electionIn July 2015, Zardari met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for the first time after winning a landslide victory in the general election. He thanked the Prime Minister for his continuous support and promised to take the government forward. Nawaz Sharif also publicly stated that he would not hold the election on 16 September. The election was held on that date and Zardari was sworn in as president along with two other elected members of the parliament.2016 general electionZardari formally tendered his resignation on 25 July 2016.

Look out air travelers. A congressional slugfest over the U.S. deficit is threatening to trigger higher airfares and widespread slowdowns at the nation's airports. Remember that big fight in Congress last year over the national ersatz defense bill? At the time, airlines were complaining that too many domestic passengers were taking advantage of their status to beat the system by riding the system to the airport with fewer restrictions. But last month House lawmakers decided just to forget about "the last time." The House voted to reject the Bush administration's proposed $1.3 trillion deficit reduction plan, which would add $1.3 billion to the national debt over 10 years by slashing spending in all areas of government. Instead, the House voted to raise the national debt limit.Even before that vote, the American public had been getting the message. Last week, Gallup reported that just 6 percent of respondents were "somewhat" or "very comfortable" with keeping the national debt limit at its current level of $12.3 trillion, while 65 percent were "mildly" or "moderately" comfortable with doing so. Gallup said that while the public supported a $1.3 trillion deficit reduction deal -- a number that even President Bush conceded could be reached -- most people didn't think "the nation is close to its limits."So what's really driving the public back towards the idea of defaulting on its debt? The Washington Post reported on Monday that at least some Wall Street institutions are encouraging the move. As soon as the Senate voted down the Bush administration's measure, a group of Wall Street bankers sent a memo to government officials and congressional leaders arguing that they could force Congress to raise the debt ceiling, even without an act of Congress. "The nation's credit rating is still on the verge of a near-term downgrade that could force a sharp cut in government spending," the memo said, "and the cost of raising the debt ceiling could be very high."What's more, the memo said, "the government could use the borrowing authority it has to make strategic investments in the private sector and to invest directly in our national priorities, without regard to the need to adhere to any particular fiscal timetable."The memo was written jointly by John D. Portes of the American Enterprise Institute and Kenneth L. Marcus of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Portes and Marcus argue that the United States should follow the example of Europe, where the European Central	0
Renowned radio personality Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a hospital in western Washington, a spokesman for St. Anthony Hospital told CNN in a written statement Thursday. "Mr. Kasem is alert and appears comfortable at urn, and we ask that you please respect his privacy as we grieve with his family," the spokesman told CNN. Kasem, 78, has been on a vacation in Spain with his family but was taken to the hospital early Thursday morning when his condition was "worsened," Kasem's rep confirmed. The hospital said Kasem had suffered a "massive stroke." Kasem is best known for his radio program "Casey Kasem's America" and his role as an announcer on the TV game shows "Jeopardy" and "Family Feud." He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. The Associated Press reported "several people around the industry" told them Kasem was in "good spirits" at his home Thursday.The Associated Press reports that Kasem was hospitalized Thursday for what a hospital spokesman there described as a "seizure event." A hospital spokesman said Kasem was taken to a local hospital where his condition was said to be "good." Kasem's rep declined to comment on his condition. CNN affiliate KIRO 7 reported Thursday night that Kasem may have suffered a brain aneurysm. Kasem was born on June 13, 1939, in Chicago and went to school there, the AP reported. Kasem graduated from Purdue University in Indiana and began his radio career in the Chicago area, the AP reported. After moving to his current home in Seattle, Kasem said in a 2001 interview with Playboy magazine, "I want to keep the memory of it being the best gig ever, because of the people I knew and the place I lived." After a show-business career, Kasem settled into a career as a news anchor. In 2007, Kasem filed a lawsuit against his radio-station distributor, CBS, claiming its station violated his trademark rights. His suit also claimed CBS had used him as a celebrity spokesperson for its "Jeopardy!" game show. CBS later issued a statement saying CBS "did not use Mr. Kasem for any of his show, commercial or personal life." CBS also said it would not comment on the case, saying it was a pending civil case. CBS said last month it would allow Kasem to return to the station's station at	0

I thought I was prepared for North Korea. After all, I'd spent more than half my life studying, traveling to and living in the former Soviet Union as well as other Communist and post-Communist countries. Until then, North Korea had been little more than an interesting footnote in my life. It was hardly in the "top 50" tourist attractions of my choice. In high school, the idea of going to North Korea on an overnight trip seemed preposterous. When my mother told me that she had been on a four-hour flight back to Los Angeles from there when she was a child, I found the idea of travelling to North Korea "stupid" and "crazy." In college, I thought a trip to the demilitarized zone was a bit of a joke. I was in my final semester of junior year at the time and had been assigned to write a term paper on Soviet-North Korean relations. I thought it would be a waste of time and an exercise in academic futility. I had heard that the U.S. had put $1 billion into the North Korean economy since 1991 and that the South Koreans had invested US$750 million for their two factories, so I figured a visit would be akin to visiting a theme park. I didn't even bother to call around to see if they were interested in meeting up with me. When I finally did get the chance to speak with them, they were more than happy to oblige but had only ten minutes before they had to leave for their summit. I tried to convince them to meet for a beer or three and a few other drinks. They were cool with it, but I thought it would be a waste of time and money. (And that is how I came to know Lee Kyeong-Seok.)A few weeks before the trip, I received word that I was attending the last week of classes in the fall semester back at UCLA. I was ecstatic. This meant I would be free for a month from December 9 to December 16. During this time, I would be able to attend a conference in San Francisco as well as other classes and have much more time to explore San Fran and the peninsula as opposed to Los Angeles. My first two days in Los Angeles were uneventful and I was pretty excited until I started working and making plans for my upcoming trip. It felt like a bit of a waste of a half year of classes to travel to North Korea	0

Bush proposed the measure last March, but it was to be voted on Tuesday, June 25.âThe National Forests should remain as unencumbered as any wildernesses in the world,â he said.But environmentalists, some of whom say that the agency was moving too slowly in addressing environmental impacts such as water quality, said the law was too restrictive and would cause job losses and harm local economies.âThis was a victory, but itâs not over yet. ...

The leader of Colombia's main leftist rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- died in a military operation in the country's southwest, President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday. "I confirm the death of Âfrica's leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,ÂÂÂÂ Colonel Luis Maza," he said on Twitter. Maza was abducted by assailants in SuluÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ province on Thursday and died Monday. He was wanted for his alleged role in several bombings and had fought in the country's war for independence from Colombia's former colonial ruler Spain. Colombia's left-wing FARC rebels and other leftist groups have fought for decades for autonomy in Colombia's conflict-ridden Andean region of South America. Maza had been living as an exile since he was kidnapped in April 2006. - The Associated PressThe US government has long been known for keeping an eye on Russia and its various relationships with various governments. With that in mind, we ask: is a relationship between Russia and the US worth cultivating and should we expect a change in how the US and Russia interact?Russia is set to get a look at one of its most sensitive sites for the first time in decades while the West is busy making peace with the Taliban and preparing to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.Officials say that in the coming days the new US ambassador to Russia, David Hale, will meet with President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. US officials say Hale will bring a new energy to the relationship, which has been weakened by the recent conflict in Ukraine and by the recent revelations that Hillary Clinton's campaign paid a Russian-linked think-tank for opposition research."He's going to be a more active ambassador, a more visible ambassador. He's going to try and change that dynamic," a senior US official told CNN. "It's only natural that that's what Russians want. Putin knows we were embarrassed by the Ukraine and we want to repair that damage."Russia and the US may have never been as close as it has been in the past 20 years, but there have been signs of new cooperation.Since then, Russia has agreed to host the annual summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Sochi this November. And President Barack Obama has said that Russia, which has already hosted the NATO summit, would host a G-8 meeting this year.The latest round of conflict between Russia and Georgia	0
Five men in El Salvador, including a police officer, were arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing last week of French filmmaker and photographer Christian Poveda, the country's attorney general's office said. Two of five men arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of French filmmaker Christian Poveda. A sixth man who allegedly ordered the murder was already in prison, according to a statement from the agency. Poveda -- who recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang, part of the Mara 18 gang in El Salvador -- was found shot dead in the town of Tonacatepeque, about 10 miles northeast of the capital, San Salvador, on September 2, authorities said. Four of those arrested were members of the same Mara 18 gang that was the subject of Poveda's film, the attorney general's office said. National Civil Police Officer Juan Napoleon Espinoza also was arrested, it said. Poveda's documentary, "La Vida Loca," which follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 gang, had been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month. His body was found in an area controlled by that same gang, local reports said.	1
A crash involving two trains in central Indonesia Saturday killed 36 people and injured 26, Â officials said. At least nine crew members were killed.A major disaster declaration was issued for the western highlands province of Riau following the crash, according to Riau's provincial disaster management agency. The agency said that all of the bodies would be flown to the disaster site from where the remains would be taken to the capital, Jakarta, for identification and autopsy.A witness told CNN that there were no signs of any fire or explosion coming from the train, which he said was a little over a kilometer away from the crash site.A senior government official said that the crash was caused by a "seismic event."The official said the train was approaching the location from a different direction than normal and that there were other trains along the same line.Authorities say that there was a mechanical problem, but this has not been confirmed to be the cause of the accident.Police said that they've found the body of a young man on the train.President Joko Widodo said that one passenger on the train was also killed, although this has not been confirmed."The first and only thing that comes to mind is that the train was hit by a large ball of fire and exploded, so the passenger on the train has also died," he told reporters.The head of the National Police in Riau said it's possible that the death toll could rise further.A senior Indonesian official said the death toll is expected to rise."There are so many people killed," the official said.The train was carrying about 2,000 passengers travelling from Bandung, some 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.The tragedy comes amid high tensions ahead of a re-election to the presidency which took place a week ago. There is also rising tension among Muslim groups over a law that would ban the construction of minarets, or prayer halls, in Muslim-majority Indonesia.A local resident who lives in the area, Ahmad, told CNN that he did not know what the explosion was."I was in my room when I heard someone was screaming and then an explosion," he said. "When I opened the door, there was a huge cloud of smoke and I saw a little man lying on the ground -	0
Elliot Rodger's difficulties with women were so devastating to him that he vowed to kill anyone he couldn't win over. "My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I  cannot win over," he told his new FBI colleague Richard Donner. He told his psychiatrist, "I'm still a virgin. I'd like to kill the woman who broke me."Rodger was by no means the only one. In the wake of the _Vietnam_ killings, the number of serial killers in America surged to more than two hundred, compared with only a handful before 1968. The serial-killing phenomenon took off early in the 1980s, when the proliferation of the internet helped drive a surge of copycat killers, many inspired by the public's fascination with a new class of killers who, unlike serial killers, were never famous or famous for killing, but were admired for the sheer number of people they killed. Serial killers often murdered in the same manner, with almost identical equipment. They also tended to take down their victims at the same moment. "They start out with the same type of approach, whether it be a very organized, highly orchestrated thing or people who kill one victim, and then they kind of go, like, 'Well, that kills two,' and they move on to the next thing," said Jeffrey MacDonald, the director of the Department of Behavioral Sciences at the University of Southern California. "And there's a lot of variation in how they kill their victims. There are no set methods for mass murder."The phenomenon was only magnified once the internet existed. "Now the internet becomes another source for these murders and I think they are getting more and more inspired by the internet," said Dr. Wendy Bower, a New York psychiatrist who studies violent crimes. "It's becoming a kind of cultural phenomenon." There are three important factors in the resurgence of serial killings. The first, as the police, media, police departments, and legal-system agencies have discovered, is that after a few murders, the killers' names will soon become public. Even if the killer's body is found—which is rare—the police have no way of identifying the killer without a DNA sample. After a few murders the killer is already recognizable to a large segment of the population. "This is a key element for anyone considering a killing or even thinking about committing a murder," said Dr	0

The 2013 tennis season may only be in its fledgling stages but already the heat is well and truly on for those preparing for the year's first major. As the great and good on the men's and women's circuits vernalise on their tennis equipment, the debate inevitably swirls around whether the equipment is worth the investment. The argument has raged on for several years and much has been made about the pros and cons of equipment, where and who produces it, and whether women's tennis needs it.Let's explore that now before the season gets underway.First ImpressionsIn a season in which a lot of talk has been made about the importance of equipment for women's tennis, let's begin by taking a deeper look at the topic. While a small section of the female population will always prefer to play with or against what they have available to them, the majority of a tennis player's equipment is chosen for them by their coaches and used by them."As the equipment market is now dominated by three companies, none of which is based in the US, the question of which to choose is a very complex one," explains Dr. Annabel Wilson. "With so many players using different brands and playing at different levels, there is no simple answer to 'Why do you want this equipment?' But as a general rule equipment brands with longer established reputations, such as Yonex and Tretman, generally provide the best value for money and provide a superior performance for player and coach.""You need to look at the total costs, including the money spent on the equipment over the last three or four years, and take into account that the equipment will last a lifetime and will need to be replaced," continues Wilson. "If you want a new pair of shoes, you may decide to spend £100 on a new pair, but if you want to replace that pair in 10 years (and it will probably then look pretty good) you would have spent £100 on a pair which was now worth only £50."The final purchase is always the most important though. "As a tennis coach I spend so much time trying to help my players to improve how they play tennis that it often means that I purchase more equipment than they actually need," said Wilson. "It's like putting a value on life and I also wish that I could help my players get the best value out of their equipment."What happens when	0
Two weeks. Two gut-wrenching, frustrating, mysterious weeks. That's how long it's been since 227 passengers and 12 crew members boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, destined for Beijing. A routine trip, it seemed, to catch up relatives in ersatz Christmas greetings, after being stuck in Dubai for three months.But then the plane was forced to return to Kuala Lumpur. A week later, it was off on a second flight.All the way to Beijing, the plane was in a deadlock. To the casual observer, it looked as if the pilot had lost it. But to the pilots and navigators on both flights, the apparent crash was just a glitch in the system—an odd, unintended, unintended and unexplained event."We have been through every scenario that could happen," the captain of the missing plane, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, said in a press conference last May, hours after his plane went down.He added: "We are very confident that all the equipment is in the right places." Flight MH370, according to the pilot, had crashed into the Indian Ocean; there was not a chance it was lost at sea. He repeated this claim often over the next 12 months, over and over and over. He also declared with absolute assurance that he knew more than he was saying. To the average man on the street, he sounded delusional, but to the team at the Malaysian Airlines center that is coordinating the search, he was 100 percent correct. The center held a meeting where they determined it was better to be right than to be sorry. It was only going to take 72 hours of exhaustive searching to find the plane.To an outsider, there was a sense that this was truly a case of life-or-death. The flight had taken off from a remote part of southwestern China on March 8, 2014. It was supposed to touch down in Beijing at 12:30 a.m.In the end, 227 passengers vanished, with all the people on board—or in the cockpit—now presumed dead.A new lifeIn the weeks that followed, my mother called every time she saw my dad's name on my schedule of events. She would have to leave the office to pick up her son from school, and she was calling for updates on my life.My father was going to be a pilot of sorts—as an airline pilot.	0
After a hole-in-one at the KLM Open in Amsterdam, golfer Andy Sullivan has won a prize that is truly out of this world. The Englishman, who found the cup with his tee shot on the 15th hole, bagged himself a flight into space courtesy of a Dutch aerospace company. XCOR Aerospace pledged a 62-minute space flight to any player who could card a hole-in-one at the 15th at the Kennemer Golf and Country Club. The trip is valued at between $95,000 and $115,000. "My caddie just shouted to me, 'we're going to space'. I was in hysterics. It's just an unreal experience. I didn't play great through the round and then I hit a shot like that," Sullivan told the European Tour's official website. Before boldly going where no professional golfer has gone before, Sullivan needs to run the idea by his wife. "I'm not sure if I'll go, I'll check with the missus," said Sullivan. "I'm not great with heights or flying! I might have to pluck up some coverage. I don't think spaceman is a new nickname for me. "My daughter will think I'm the best dad in the world -- a professional golfer and an astronaut, she's got the best dad in the world! I'm going to have to pluck up some serious courage, but it is a once in a lifetime experience, so I'm going to have to do it."	1
Iran's centrist president-elect expressed a willingness to open dialogue with the United States, which it hasn't had diplomatic relations with in decades, but only if the United States recognizes Iran's right to a nuclear program. Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency over the weekend, said in his first news conference Monday, however, that the Islamic republic has no intention of ending its uranium-enrichment program. The program is a major impetus for the international sanctions against Iran. Calling relations between the U.S. and Iran an "old wound" and "complicated," Rouhani said that before there are talks, the U.S. must first promise to never interfere with Iranian domestic affairs and scrap its "unilateral" and "bullying policies." "Wisdom tells us both countries, both nations need to think more about the future and try to sit down and find solutions to past issues and rectify things," he said. "The rights of the Iranian nation, including nuclear rights, need to be recognized." "We are prepared to see tensions alleviated," he added, noting that any talks "should be based on mutual respect and interest and equal footing." In opening his news conference, Rouhani, 65, said repairing Iran's economy and engaging in more dialogue -- both at home and abroad -- will be his administration's top priorities. Dialogue and the economy are related, as Iran faces sharp international sanctions over its nuclear program, but Rouhani said he foresees a "fresh opportunity for interaction at the global level." Mutual trust and transparency are key to the international community lifting sanctions, which he called "brutal, and the people of Iran have done nothing wrong to deserve sanctions." "Making use of the lever of sanctions, this is not the right time for that. ... Even in the West, they are facing economic problems and dilemmas, and they themselves know the sanctions are to the detriment of the West," Rouhani said, adding that Israel was the only country benefiting from them. "We can make it clear to the whole world that the measures and activities of the Islamic republic are totally within international regulations and mechanisms." Rouhani did not elaborate on how he would make the country's nuclear program more transparent, but he insisted that the Iranian nuclear program was lawful. He also voiced opposition to international "meddling" in domestic affairs.	1
A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA. The blast caused damage but there were no immediate reports of casualties.The warning call came from ETA as the group was preparing explosives to kill police and other senior officers. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.A Spanish official with direct links to the Basque separatist group said it was the first time the group had detonated a bomb inside a van."ETA has never previously done this," one of the group's leaders said.An ETA spokesman said the attack may have been meant to show the police the strength of the group.A policeman stands guard near the blast site in Madrid. Associated PressSpanish media quoted officials as saying the van had been hired for a previous job in the northern town of Torrejon, near the Spanish border with Portugal.The local Spanish police chief said that a bomb caused the vehicle to break down in a side street, causing the blast in the middle of the night.Local media quoted the town mayor, Juan Antonio Zugazaga, as saying that local police were called to the area at 4:30 a.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET).The Basque Autonomous Government in Bilbao has said it will hold a "major" meeting on the attack as soon as possible."It was a very powerful bomb, and I hope we can be here and say we are going to stop this," Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said at a meeting in Washington, D.C., with NATO defense ministers.He was asked whether the attack would raise Spanish concerns about the ability of the country to protect its police."We have done more with less in the last two years. There is no reason why we cannot do things further. We will do everything it takes to be able to protect our police, the Basque Country, our Spanish unity and a common future," he said.Zapatero said he had spoken to Spain's foreign minister about the incident and that all his ministers were "deeply sorry" for it.The prime minister also reiterated that "we continue to have very open communication with the Basque separatists, who continue to have good relations with us. We are going to have more talks	0
Clusters of Roman skulls have been discovered deep below London's Liverpool Street by construction workers digging a new rail route through England's capital. Tunnelers working on the Crossrail project found about 20 skulls, deep beneath the 16th century Bedlam burial ground in the center of the city, Crossrail said in a statement. Read more: Rail excavation unearths suspected 'plague pit' The human skulls -- as well as fragments of Roman pottery -- were found in sediment of the historic river channel of the River Walbrook, a tributary of the River Thames, it said. Roman-era skulls had been found along the path of the River Thames throughout London's history, fueling speculation they were the heads of the victims of rebels fighting under Queen Boudicca against Roman occupation, lead archaeologist Jay Carver said. Read more: London dig turns up slice of Roman life "We now think the skulls are possibly from a known Roman burial ground about 50 meters up river from our Liverpool Street station worksite," he said. "Their location in the Roman layer indicates they were possibly washed down river during the Roman period." Crossrail said tunnelers at Liverpool Street also discovered medieval wooden structures, which archaeologists believe may have formed part of the Bedlam cemetery walls. About 3,000 skeletons previously discovered at the Bedlam burial ground are set to be relocated next year. The Museum of London Archaeology will analyse the finds, which are the latest in more than 10,000 archaeological items found across 40 project construction sites, Crossrail said.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks. Condoleezza Rice and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Ã¢â‚¬Å“The relationship between the United States and Libya is deep and enduringÃ¢â‚¬Â The Washington Post reports (10/5/06). She called for dialogue between both countries and assured Libya that the U.S. was ready to help its people and rebuild.The president, in a message to lawmakers, wrote that the hurricanes had shown the world "how weak the United States and our freedoms are" and noted that there were more than 2,700 dead from the storms. He closed by saying "we have yet to learn the lessons from these storms but we must be honest and frank in speaking out about them."The president's message was approved by a voice vote and was sent to lawmakers on the Senate floor. It was the second time the president sent messages to congressional leaders regarding the storms. President Bush called both Republican and Democratic senators before Christmas as part of an effort to get lawmakers to approve a bill to give the government additional money. The president proposed spending $30 billion in Iraq funding.Bush also called Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who announced yesterday that he would vote against the $87 billion bill to fund the Government. The bill would send more than $6 billion to help the victims of the hurricanes. Bush also called House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to inform him of the proposed funding bill.Yesterday, President Bush addressed the nation after speaking with Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., over the phone. The conversation was made public by the White House just before Sen. McCain announced his opposition to the government spending bill. The White House released a full transcript of the president's conversation with the senator. Sen. McCain stated that the government spending bill should not pass as it is "an unneeded and unnecessary $87 billion spending bill, an unnecessary money grab.Here is the text of President Bush's message regarding the government spending bill: On the other hand, however, the proposed $87 billion spending bill is an unneeded and unnecessary $87 billion spending bill, an unnecessary money grab that will add to the debt.

Bread. For Egypt's middle classes it is breakfast, lunch and dinner. In Egyptian Arabic it is known as "aish" which means both bread and life. Bread is the staple food of Egypt's poor -- 40 percent of whom live on around $2 per day For many Egyptians  "bread" means "bread of life". To get to the heart of this, we will begin our analysis with a consideration of what bread is. We will then turn to consider when bread is eaten -- before, during and after meals. The meal breaks will also be considered.What is bread?In Islam, the most widely accepted form of food, food is defined as "sati." To be a Muslim is to be a sated. A Muslim takes food as a sacrament. Islam regards food as an act of worship. The Koran even defines God. According to that definition, the Almighty is not a foodstuff, but a form of food in its own right. And as a form of God, He is the only foodstuff. The Koran says:"God took flesh from (mankind) and He formed it, then He breathed into it and it was a living thing" (The Words of God, 48:16).The Koran continues:"Indeed, mankind and jinn are alike, and God is free of all beings, either as a male or a female, and whatever creature He chooses." (The Words of God, 48:22)The Koran does not define "bread.""To Him belong the whole earth and all that is in it and to Him belongs all that is within it" (Al-Ma'idah, 2:6)."We shall ask on the day of Resurrection: 'What were you doing at the time when we were being created? Were you with Adam in the Garden of Eden?'" (The Words of God, 2:187).The Koran refers to bread in the verse:"And God said, 'Behold! The people are those who believe and the disbelievers are those who do not believe'" (The Words of God, 15:5).Thus, the Koran offers a form of religious food. And as an expression of worship, bread is food. In other words, to be a Muslim is to be, in a sense of the word, a sated. A Muslim takes food as a	0
Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld cited "suspicious objects" found Thursday. He did not say what the objects were, whether they had been lit or whether fire was used to start the fires. The fires continue to ravage the sparsely populated Shef Shefa regional council area, where the majority of the victims live.Rene Bouzian, an assistant fire chief, said investigators had found a note in the burnt-out home, reading "Please don't burn any more people with us." Israel Television news reported that the note had been written by a woman who was a relative of one of the people still missing.The first three days of the fire were relatively calm, Rosenfeld said Friday. It was only on Thursday evening that firefighters discovered that the fire was "far greater than originally believed."The incident highlights the ongoing battle between Israel and the Palestinians over the West Bank and Gaza Strip - two territories held by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.Palestinians accuse Israel of using Palestinian territories for military and construction activity and of violating the rights of the local population. Israel, in turn, accuses the Palestinians of deliberately setting the fires as retribution for the deaths of Palestinians during Israeli assaults on West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.On Thursday, Palestinian leaders said the recent wave of arson attacks was organized by Islamic militants.A few days ago, fire ravaged the West Bank town of Beit Ummar in northern West Bank district Jenin. The Palestinian Red Crescent said 46 people were injured in that fire.There are also reports of arson attacks in Gaza, which have claimed three lives. There, Israeli forces fired tear gas at Palestinian protesters who threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who said they were responding to reports of the use of firebombs.Thursday, May 30, 2011After a week of fighting, Hamas had retaken control of the Gaza Strip, just as it did in previous confrontations with Israel.The takeover was described by Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri, who claimed that Gazans had become accustomed to Israel's occupation and its use of violent response to any perceived Palestinian provocation."Hamas knows that Israel's only solution is the total destruction of this regime," he said	0
Israeli troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, with Syrian authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded. The protests came on the anniversary of an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad that has been a feature of daily life for the last six months."Our demands are simple, one: that Bashar al-Assad step down as the president of Syria and hand power over to a transitional government," said Mahmoud al-Frieh, one of the protest organizers. "We are also demanding the government to stop the repression," he said.According to the Syrian authorities, at least 36 people were killed across the country and nearly 400 were injured by gunfire on Sunday. According to a report in the British daily "The Independent," the protests were the biggest in more than a year. The report said it was the deadliest day for anti-government demonstrations since at least October 2005.The Syrian government, which accused the protesters of being funded by Israel, blamed the demonstrations on terrorists linked to the opposition."The government has instructed all security and defense  personnel, as well as the security forces and the forces of the interior ministry to remain at their posts, and to respond to any security threats on any pretext," the government said in a statement.A witness told reporters at the scene that pro-government demonstrators had attacked protesters who were trying to cross the border."The army was shooting across the border [and] shooting at people trying to cross into the Golan Heights," the witness said, according to "The Independent." "People were injured by soldiers and ambulances."An army officer said there were hundreds of bullets fired at the border. He added that troops were firing in a way that was aimed at people on the other side of the border. The witness said he saw people running for their lives. "The army was shooting from four directions — from where I was — from the right, the left and also from the front," he said.The violence prompted the army to open fire on the border."The army fired from the border to respond to the armed terrorists who were firing towards the troops from the Golan Heights," army spokeswoman Louay Safieddine said.Another witness told reporters that the protesters had crossed into Israel and were on their way to Tel Aviv, but soldiers had killed two of the	0
Some people might give you the shirt off their back for free. Others might give you their last name -- for a fee. "I just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and I don't need this last name anymore," explained 30-year old entrepreneur Jason Sadler, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. "I thought 'How am I going to find a new last name?' well 'Why not just sell it?'" To many, the idea of selling off the family surname might be crazy. Sadler says he wants to reinvest the money he makes into other "fun marketing things" and "give 10% of it to charity." The bidding ended December 13 on Sadler's website -- buymylastname.com -- and the winning bidder will pay $45,500 for Sadler to change his name to Jason Headsets.com. For all of 2013, Sadler will legally assume the new surname decided by the winning bidder and will need to change all official forms of identification. The legal process may take several weeks, according to the Florida state courts system, and involves submitting fingerprints for a state and national criminal check, the associated cost for processing, a court date to consider the name change request and a judge's final approval. This is not Sadler's first attempt at a more creative -- if unorthodox -- moneymaking scheme. In 2009, the entrepreneur started wearing the shirts of other companies, serving as a walking ad space for a day. He pulled in more than $66,000 on top of his regular day job that first year. That start-up still operates today at iwearyourshirt.com. Watch: Human advertising in space Sadler, interviewed earlier in the week by CNN, rejects the idea that he is selling out. "The reason I say that is that I don't want this last name anymore. The name Sadler doesn't mean anything to me anymore. And for me I want to work with a brand. I live in this kind of online marketing world and I'm very passionate about it. If I said I'll take any casino or pornography site -- that would be selling out." Sadler set some guidelines before the winning bid.	1
Former Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez died at a Madrid hospital Sunday after long illness, his family said. Suarez was 81. Suarez was Spain's first prime minister in the transition to democracy after the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who died in November 1975. King Juan Carlos, who appointed Suarez prime minister in 1976, issued a televised statement calling him "a great servant of Spain and was not always well understood." "Suarez is the example that we can together overcome the greatest difficulties," King Juan Carlos said. Suarez convened the first democratic elections in 1977. He resigned in early 1981, just weeks before an unsuccessful coup attempt by military officers. People we lost in 2014	1
Morocco's Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20 has called on civil society groups the length of the country to participate in a nationwide demonstration Sunday. The youth group's main aim is to draw massive attention to the subject of corruption in this North African country, which was recently ranked at the 89th most corrupt in the world by Transparency International. Despite a government initiative to crack down on corruption with a two-year plan -- rolled out in October -- and a recent law to protects whistle-blowers, most Moroccans believe that graft is a key issue that needs to be tackled head-on. Government initiatives are widely regarded as ineffective. Corruption accounts for a loss of about 2% of Morocco's GDP, officials have said. More important, it deters vital foreign direct investment from flowing into Morocco, they say. The 45,000-strong movement is said to be supported by most of Morocco's non-governmental organizations, according to press reports. "We call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption, to injustice and for a real democracy in our country," explained one youth on a video posted on the movement's Facebook page. The movement, which is often criticized as having been infiltrated by mainstream politicians from various parties, is expected to put as much pressure as possible on King Mohammed VI. He recently pledged a considerable overhaul of the country's political setup, including the election of a prime minister, rather than appointment, and the shift of power from the capital to the regions. The king is widely revered in Morocco, yet many Moroccans are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-June, after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint. Many world leaders, such as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, see the plan as a bold example for other Arab countries to follow. Clinton recently said that the move represented a "model for others in the region" that holds "great promise first and foremost for the Moroccan people." Yet few Moroccans are so upbeat about the new constitution, as there seems to be little in it to give hope to many who want concrete initiatives to reduce corruption.	1
The Justice Department on Thursday announced 300 additional arrests in a four-year operation that it says produced nearly 1,200 arrests and seizures totaling 11.7 tons of illegal drugs. Authorities look through seized property after a drug raid at a house near Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the wrap-up of Project Coronado, which resulted in arrests in 15 states in the past two days. Holder said the operation targeted the distribution network of a major Mexican drug trafficking organization known as La Familia. About 3,000 federal agents participated in the investigation and raids, officials said. "This unprecedented, coordinated U.S. law enforcement action -- the largest ever undertaken against a Mexican drug cartel -- has dealt a significant blow to La Familia's supply chain of illegal drugs, weapons and cash flowing between Mexico and the United States," Holder said in a news conference.  Watch Holder announce the arrests » Michele Leonhart, acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said the cartel was known for specializing in the trafficking of methamphetamine and for its brutal violence, including beheadings. Authorities said the arrests made Wednesday and Thursday occurred in California, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Dozens of arrests occurred in the Dallas, Texas, area where agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives filed charges against cartel members believed to have illegally purchased and shipped high-powered firearms to the cartel, which was based in the Mexican state of Michoacan. U.S. officials vowed to indict cartel leaders and extradite them to the United States. One leader, Servando Gomez-Martinez, was indicted in New York on Thursday. He remains at large, and is presumed to be in Mexico. A senior law enforcement official involved in the operation, who asked not to be identified, said he was certain the latest crackdown on La Familia would affect the methamphetamine market in the United States for months. "It'll make a difference not only because of how hard we hit 'em, but where we hit 'em," the official said. Another official said during the course of the investigation that labs run by La Familia had been discovered in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Jose, California.	1
Six gay men were shot dead by members of their tribe in two separate incidents in the past 10 days, an official with Iraq's Interior ministry said. In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad after they were disowned by relatives, the official said. The shootings came after a tribal meeting was held and the members decided to go after the victims. On March 26, four additional men were fatally shot in the same city, the official said, adding that the victims had also been disowned by their relatives. The official declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Witnesses told CNN that a Sadr City cafe, which was a popular gathering spot for gays, was also set on fire.	1
Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his ersatz stronghold, according to a U.S. official familiar with the efforts.With the help of U.S. intelligence, the rebels are attempting to crack the hardened metal walls of subterranean tunnels in the Libyan capital, where Gadhafi is believed to have hidden since a series of military victories in Libya in the 1980s and 90s.“This is a real problem,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive effort to thwart Gadhafi’s possible escape. The official said the Obama administration was considering a range of steps to stop Gadhafi from leaving Libya and returning to power in the country's capital, Tripoli.“If Gadhafi leaves, then it will be a humanitarian disaster,” the official said.An error occurred while retrieving the Tweet. It might be available again byclicking here.Gadhafi is believed to have fled the country following the 2011 uprising, which toppled him and his son, Moammar, for the third time in seven decades, after NATO-backed rebels took control of most of the country's oil infrastructure in 2011. Libya’s government accused Gadhafi of ordering his forces to attack the rebels, and a video of captured rebels being hanged — a sign of their own executions — helped cement Gadhafi’s public image in the eyes of the Muslim world.The United Nations estimates that Gadhafi has killed at least 100,000 of his own citizens in his 33-year rule.“It seems that we have a long way to go before we can even think about something like that,” a senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News. “The Libyan opposition is just trying to deal with what it has to. And if they can’t do that, then they’re going to have to find a way to deal with what they have to and deal with the problems on the ground.”The official added: “They’re very worried that Gaddafi could somehow use this or something like this to return.”A group of rebels on Wednesday began removing large metal plates from the tunnels, which could be used to construct	0
Not for the first time Mario Balotelli, who plays for one of Europe's biggest soccer teams AC Milan, is in the spotlight again. The Italian international is the focus of racially charged remarks made by Milan vice president Paulo Berlusconi, the younger brother of former prime minister and team owner Silvio Berlusconi. During a political rally for his brother where he invited the public to an upcoming match, the younger Berlusconi was caught on camera -- the video is now featured on the website of Italian newspaper La Repubblica -- saying: "OK, we are all off to see the family's little black boy. "He's a crazy head. All the young ladies are invited as well -- you can even have a chance to meet the president [Silvio Berlusconi]." Milan declined to comment on the remarks when contacted by CNN, while Balotelli's representatives have yet to respond to phone and email messages. Italy national team striker Balotelli joined Milan last week after a two-and-a-half-year stint with English champions Manchester City, during which time he attracted media attention for his off-field antics and ill discipline on the pitch. The incident involving Berlusconi's brother comes one month after another racial incident involving a black AC Milan player. AC's German-born Ghanaian international midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch after being subjected to racist chanting during a friendly match with fourth division team Pro Patria. Silvio Berlusconi, as well as world football head Sepp Blatter, backed Boateng for taking a strong stance against prejudicial abuse, though the FIFA president noted that walk-offs are not a long-term solution to the problem. Offensive Italian football expert and author John Foot explained how Paulo Berlusconi's words were offensive on several levels. "It is an insult," Foot told CNN. "It's not n***** translated, but it would translate as 'little negro' or 'little family negro'. A lot of Italians wouldn't necessarily see it as racist, but that doesn't mean it isn't. "I'm sure Balotelli would see it as an insult. Even if you take the racial element out of it, it is quite insulting. The idea that they own this person has a lot of other connotations."	1
It's too late to stop WikiLeaks from publishing thousands more classified documents, nabbed from the Pentagon's secret network. But the U.S. military is telling its troops to stop using CDs, DVDs, thumb drives and every other form of removable media -- urns, binders, and boxes -- to keep their files safe and sound.The army and the Marine Corps have issued a list of "non-security approved" media, which includes:* Any removable media used to transport classified Pentagon documents. This includes CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, or any other removable media. (The exceptions are the classified CDs and DVDs used to transport classified documents, if the media is "non-secure" or labeled "classified, no photocopy, no return.") * Any media that contains classified information. * Any media used to transport other classified documents.Military documents are meant to remain classified for a lifetime. But the media that members use in their personal lives -- not to mention in their off-hours -- is not considered classified, and is thus unprotected. These CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, and other media are not even required to be labeled "classified" or "non-classified." The "non-secure" designation on these media means the information on these files is considered "readily available" in the public domain.The Pentagon's own research has shown that more than 30 percent of members' off-duty CD and DVD media were "non-secure." And there is nothing in the law or Pentagon policy that requires these members to take any action to secure the data on these files.At the Pentagon, the army and the Marine Corps have decided that they are going to assume the responsibility of securing these potentially non-secure files.The Pentagon also has a "personal data strategy" for the military, which provides instructions on how to handle personal files and documents. The strategy includes a "security standard for protected information" that "assumes the member knows how to make their own secure media," said Tom Gaffney, director of the Defense Digital Service at the Pentagon.The strategy also encourages the Department of Defense and the military to use media that are labeled "non-secure."That's the recommendation from the Navy and Marine Corps, which have issued their own instructions to their troops. The Army was already following similar recommendations, based on the same research by the Pentagon, and is now telling members to	0
Activists speaking at a Syrian government-sponsored "national dialogue" meeting Sunday criticized recent crackdowns by the country's security forces, calling for an end to violence against protesters. Syria's vice president hailed the Damascus University  analyst  Omar Suleiman, saying he was "one of the most important personalities in Syria's history." The two have been in and out of each other's company for the past year, and were described by  CNN's  Christiane Amanpour as "a very serious pair," despite their contrasting personalities."We don't know what role he would have played to prevent the bloodshed, but I think we should all be more grateful to him because he brought some degree of stability to this country and made sure that Bashar al-Assad is not on the brink of failing," Amanpour said.She contrasted Suleiman with the regime's chief prosecutor, who was replaced Sunday."He was a hero in the eyes of many Syrians, including many Syrians who lost their fellow countrymen," Amanpour said. "And he got removed to the most symbolic place on the day that we saw a massive crackdown which killed thousands and injured thousands, to put it in a way that they thought the Assad regime had to be stopped," Amanpour said.Suleiman, while on an official visit to the United Kingdom, acknowledged on Al Jazeera that the Assad regime has "done some things that were not good. Like a great many things in the country, you can't have everything perfect. But that is part of the regime's strategy, they have to make people question everything and to be critical."On Al Jazeera, Suleiman said, "I have the authority to tell people what is happening.""We do not have any choice but to have a conversation," he said. "There are many different people in Syria." He said that the protesters want to return to the pre-2011 period of democracy and "that is why we need to be critical and to say that, yes, we are watching what is happening in Syria."He also said, "If we are talking to the people, then we also have to change our views."On Sunday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said that in addition to Suleiman, the high-level state delegation was headed by Syria's minister of intelligence and information, Dr. Ammar al-Masri, and Syria's minister	0
It's a good thing Chrisette Michele didn't choke last week when she heard the news she had a No. 1 album on her hands. Chrisette Michele's album "Epiphany" debuted at No. 1 earlier in May. "I was backstage at the David Letterman show on a couch, probably eating grapes," says the singer-songwriter. "I always eat grapes before I go on." The acid and pectin in the fruit help prepare her voice for performing, the 26-year-old goes on to explain. But nothing, she says, could have prepared her for the excitement she'd feel upon learning her sophomore album, "Epiphany," debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart. She had to go chill out at a lakeside ranch for a couple of days to let it all sink in. But this isn't Michele's first big career moment: She won a Grammy this year in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category for her single, "Be OK," featuring will.i.am. The song first appeared on her soul-tinged 2007 debut album "I Am," for which she penned all her own lyrics. This time around, Michele, whose voice has earned her comparisons to Billie Holiday and Jill Scott, relinquished some songwriting duties to R&B singer Ne-Yo. Michele talked to CNN about the experience of sharing pen and paper, the real-life epiphany behind "Epiphany" and why she likes making mischief.  Watch Michele belt out a tune » CNN: Have you had a big epiphany recently? Michele: I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking. I'm a thinker. I'm always writing poetry, I'm always coming to conclusions. The latest epiphany is that I really don't have to be afraid of anybody. And the reason why it was an epiphany was when I first started, I was so afraid that maybe they won't like me. And I was just being myself, I was being really honest. And so I felt that if they didn't like me that would really hurt. But I found out that there's a lot more lovers out there than I realized, and the world is much smaller than I thought. And so there's no need to be afraid. CNN: Tell me about the single.	1
Today's hotel bathrooms are more than the sum of their sinks and shower heads. They serve as ultimate sanctuaries, providing the comforts of home or transporting guests to another realm. "We're seeing more attention to  bathroom aesthetics and design," says Mark Hurd of Hurd Studio in Nashville. "Bathrooms are all over the place these days. It's become an obsession to people, especially our children. We think it's an exciting trend."The bathroom has always been a key component in every bathroom renovation. But even more so now, with the proliferation of personal electronics, such as smart phones and tablets, to be used in there. "Many millennials like to be on their phone in the bathroom. It's a much bigger social issue," says Mike Dutton, of Dutton Bathroom Design, in Chicago."It's all about the bathroom space and functionality," says Dutton, who's worked with clients from all over the world, from France to the Philippines. He also says the bathroom is the first place many parents look for the best fit for a young child.The bathroom "is the first of many stages to a complete bathroom remodel or renovation," says Hurd. Hurd recommends a complete renovation be started with a bathroom transformation that includes:  * Creating more space for guests to use  * Renovating the counter top and storage  * Revamping fixtures to fit the new space  * Installing better storage systems  * Plumbing upgrades  * Refining the tile design, shape, and color"In a complete bathroom remodel, we start by doing a complete bathroom transformation of the entire space," says Hurd. If you're planning for a full bathroom renovation, the first step you need to do is figure out what the most important elements of that space are, he says."There's no way to know which space is going to be most important without seeing the space first. So look at what's there and decide what is going to work the best for you and your family," says Hurd.Once you have a good idea of what your ideal bathroom is, you can start to look at the space. This gives you a place to begin. "From there you can do preliminary sketches, as well as create a list of ideas and design strategies," says Hurd.The basic steps to creating a bathroom renovation include:	0
The military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned. "In most cases, if we don't have anything, eventually they'll be  released," one general told The New York Times.The Pentagon has been unable to keep up with demands from attorneys for soldiers who lost family in Iraq during the war, who want access to their service records after they are ordered to destroy them under the military's Privacy Act.Attorney Michael L. Rata and his partner Michael Wines, who have filed a lawsuit seeking access to the records, estimate that the process by which the government was allowed to destroy the records has already destroyed more than 7,000 soldiers' records.According to Rata, the military has not responded to his request for a copy of the records for all of its 77,000 former detainees.The records, many of which are in Arabic, contain personal information about the soldiers: their name, rank, dates of birth and unit number and were written by their military commanders over their objections.In total, the documents -- which were written up over the objections of the soldiers -- contain more than 100,000 names, addresses, phone numbers, home addresses and dates of birth.However, lawyers for the detainees say the records contain their entire service history and are so important they should be released to them."If you look at the records, when you look at the records they're in many cases incredibly revealing about these individuals," Rata said.After the release of the documents, Rata and Wines were shocked at how much of the information in the records is irrelevant to the lives of the soldiers."It is a huge black hole," Rata said.The release of the records has also sparked legal action in the Southern District of New York against those who destroyed the records, arguing that the government must preserve a portion of the military's privacy records and provide access to the courts.The government has denied the government attorneys' claim that it has destroyed information about individual soldiers, saying that the process was handled properly and was approved by the Secretary of Defense, Defense Secretary Robert Gates.The Bush administration has said since the beginning of the Iraq war that the detainees were not part of the war. However, when former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld allowed about 2,	0
Dr. Andre Berger sees himself as a pioneer. Where others in the medical community believe injections of human growth hormone should be given to adults in only rare cases, Berger believes it is a crucial part of keeping people young and vital. Dr. Andre Berger says the patients requesting HGH from him are getting younger and younger. Berger, who has been practicing anti-aging and holistic medicine for 30 years, says he is now prescribing injections of HGH to about one out of every four people he treats at his Rejuvalife Vitality Institute in Beverly Hills. "People come here for generally two reasons; they want to look better, and they want to feel better," Berger says. While Berger says most of his patients are middle-aged, he's now getting calls from Hollywood 30-somethings wanting HGH and rap artists inquiring about illegal steroids, something he does not offer. "They feel that part of being a rap star is looking buff and having big muscles, etc., so anything they can do to bring themselves to look like that is going to enhance the whole image," he says. HGH has been used since the 1950s to help children with growth problems, but it stayed under the radar for other uses until 1990, when Dr. Daniel Rudman reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that men taking a six-month course of HGH reduced their body fat by 14.4 percent while increasing lean muscle mass by 8.8 percent. The study included just a dozen men, but it inspired a flood of anti-aging literature touting the benefits of growth hormone, along with countless Web sites selling HGH creams and sprays. Endocrinologists say those products, though, are worthless -- the body can use HGH only when it's injected to treat patients with HGH, Berger says they must be diagnosed with a deficiency of HGH, which happens naturally as the body ages. "It's a very important hormone, but it's not something to be taken in isolation," he says. Berger says he prescribes HGH to restore normal levels of the hormone and makes it part of a broader long-term treatment program including diet, nutritional supplements, exercise and other hormone replacement. Dennis Pelino, a 60-year-old Beverly Hills entrepreneur, says five years ago, he was having trouble keeping up with the younger people he was doing business with, so he started treatments, which included HGH injections.	1
A Spanish court is requesting an arrest warrant for alleged Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk. In a ruling dated January 7 but released Friday, Spanish Judge Ismael Moreno Chamarro said Demjanjuk is accused of being "an accomplice to the death of more than 5,000 victims of the war in the Ukraine.""Demjanjuk, who has been living in Spain since at least 1997, participated in organized and systematic persecution and extermination of Jews and war victims," according to the ruling.However, in a January 15 statement, "The Jewish communities in Spain and abroad have expressed their rejection of the decision to request the arrest warrant against Demjanjuk.""The Jewish community is extremely disappointed by the ruling against Dr. Demjanjuk," a statement on the Jewish community's website said. "They are also dismayed by the lack of support for the victims of the Holocaust in Spain, whose cases were not considered by the court.""The court was obliged to accept the testimonies of those who knew of his presence in the country as proven fact," said a statement issued on behalf of two groups which oppose the ruling.Demjanjuk's lawyer, Pablo Rabinovich-Ramis, said the accusation was "false, groundless and without basis." In a telephone interview with the National Public Radio, he called the accusation "absurd" and "unfounded.""What do they want from this man? He's not going to change his lifestyle," said Rabinovich-Ramis, referring to the allegations. "Look at him, he's just a small shopkeeper who lives the life of a human being."The case is considered important because it's in a country where the Holocaust is a subject to be discussed, and the ruling could put the issue of demjanjuk at the forefront of Spain's Holocaust discussion. In Spain, many Jewish communities are asking the government for its support in their fight against other nations' demands for compensation for the victims of the Holocaust.It is not the first time that Demjanjuk has come before a Spanish court. In 1988, he was accused of war crimes and genocide by Spain's Supreme Court. He was never tried, as is customary in Spain.Demjanjuk is believed to have done an estimated 300,000 to 1 million service acts, "according to some estimates."	0
Firefighters gained ground in recent days in the battle with a wildfire that burned 84 buildings and blackened 28,000 acres of dense forest in northern California. The Ponderosa fire, which is in  of unincorporated Placer County and is burning in the Sierra Nevada foothills west of Sacramento, has the second-highest acreage in California history (after the Kincade Fire). In all, more than 1,600 firefighters from the California National Guard and state fire departments were called to the fire.The fire, which started Wednesday, has burned nearly twice the area burned in the Kincade Fire. Officials fear the blaze may have destroyed several historic structures. Kincade was the largest fire in California history until it burned almost 2,500 homes and other buildings in January 2017, also in Placer County.Firefighters, however, managed to contain the Ponderosa fire, which consumed nearly half of the total acreage burned in the Kincade Fire.According to Sacramento County Fire Inspector Dave Mears, “The good news is the fire contained tonight, at one point the fire line was six miles and a mile long. And the fire line has continued to shrink with the passage of time, because it’s burning so hot, so there’s not as much ember fuel, it’s going into the structure of the fire lines and shrinking them.”An emergency response team of 80 firemen and a helicopter dropped water on the fire.The fire had spread to a ridge, and flames climbed more than 500 feet in just a few hours, Mears said. He said the structure was hard to pinpoint because of the blaze’s high humidity. The smoke from the fire is so intense that it can travel three miles, Mears said.More than 4,500 firefighters are working on the fire.The fire had burned about 8,100 acres by Friday evening, Mears said.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had declared a statewide emergency, has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to investigate why a Federal Aviation Administration flight training plane had passed through the air above the fire area. Newsom had earlier said he asked the FAA “to immediately investigate and determine the cause of the plane’s close approach to the Ponderosa Fire area.”“I just saw the smoke. The sky was red,	0
There's a lot of sky-is-falling doomsday predictions about the World Conference on International Telecommunications, which opens Monday in Dubai with some 190-plus nations discussing the global internet's future. That's because much of the accompanying proposals from the global community have been kept under lock and key, although some of the positions of nations have been leaked and published online. The idea behind the meetings is to update the International Telecommunications Regulations governed by the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency known as the ITU, that is responsible for global communication technologies. But the outcome of the two-week session isn't likely to make much change, as no proposal will be accepted if not agreed to by all nations. And the biggest fear — that the session will lead to net censorship — has already come to pass. "Member States already have the right, as stated in Article 34 of the Constitution of ITU, to block any private telecommunications that appear 'dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency.' The treaty regulations cannot override the Constitution," said Hamadoun Touré, the ITU Secretary-General. Emma Llanso, a policy attorney with the Center for Democracy & Technology, said proposals by various governments to treat internet connections like the telephone system are cause for concern regarding privacy and the unfettered, free flow of information. But there is no "doomsday" internet kill switch scenario, she said. "There's not going to be some kind of doomsday scenario that there's a treaty that makes the internet go dark," Llanso said. "What we're seeing is governments putting forward visions of the internet and having discussions." The last time the International Telecommunication Regulations global treaty was considered was in 1988. But technology has changed dramatically in the past 25 years. On the table for discussion are spectrum and technology standards to improve global interoperability and efficiency. Cybersecurity, spam and data retention are also on the table. Brett Solomon, executive director of Access, a digital rights group, is livid that the debate will be done largely in secret, with limited input from stakeholders.	1
Maybe you got the email, too? It landed in my inbox at 1:58 a.m. on Thursday. "To Our Members: Safeguarding your personal, financial and medical information is one of our top priorities, and because of that, we have state-of-the-art information security systems to protect your data." Oh, good. Nice to know. <starts to click "delete"> "However, despite our efforts ... Umm ... "...Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was the target of a very sophisticated external cyber attack." Wait, what the ... "These attackers gained unauthorized access to Anthem's IT system and have obtained personal information from our current and former members such as their names, birthdays, medical IDs/social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data." Social Security! Income data! &#^@! It's not the first email you want to open in the morning. The only consolation, I suppose, is that I'm far from alone. Anthem, which is the second largest health insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen. The breach "ranks among the largest in corporate history," writes CNNMoney. I don't know about the other 79,999,999 of you, but it's a strange feeling (right?) to all of a sudden be part of a news story like this. We read about these data breaches all the time -- from Home Depot, Target, Sony. Unless you're connected to them personally, though, they tend to zip by, too numerous and massive to process. But when it's your inbox, your data, something about it feels different. Yeah, that's selfish. But it was enough of a motivator for me to call up a couple data security experts to dig into this a little bit. My goal, like any vindictive jerk: Figure out who to blame. The first, logical inclination, I figured, was to blame Anthem, itself. Shouldn't this company, with its Orwellian emails, have done more with its "state-of-the-art information security system" to try to prevent an attack? Couldn't it have implemented a super state-of-the-art system or something?	1
Li Keqiang on Friday was named China's premier, the No. 2 position in the Chinese government, completing the once-a-decade transition of leadership in the world's most populous nation. He replaces Wen Jiabao. Li rose to the vernacular as the one who could "stand up to the West."But China's transformation into a more open and competitive economy could run into opposition. A growing number of Chinese are unhappy with their country's leadership.A recent survey showed that a majority of Chinese are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Some 84 percent of those polled expressed unhappiness with the performance of the government, compared with 61 percent who approve of the leadership.The latest survey was done by Hong Kong-based research firm Ipsos, for the China Daily. It was made public Thursday.The survey showed that 69 percent of those surveyed said they were dissatisfied with the country's economic situation, compared with just 11 percent who were satisfied.It also showed that a third of those surveyed believed the economic situation in China has gotten worse, up from 18 percent last year, while 23 percent said the situation has remained the same.More than a third of those polled -- 35 percent -- said China's leadership is capable of handling the task of dealing with challenges, while 36 percent said the leadership is not capable and 28 percent were unsure of the direction.Li's ascension to the premiership was long predicted. In 2003, former premier Wen Jiabao, while still serving as vice president, made a formal request that Li be made the premier. Wen was the acting head of the Communist Party of China and took over the job when Li was chosen to replace Liu Binyan.Wen had been serving as president since May and is to become vice president in the new leadership. President Jiang Zemin was to have been given the presidency last week. But Jiang refused -- probably because he had no intention of letting his country's economy run into trouble. Jiang instead proposed that Jiang's son, Wen Jiabao, be named as head of a new cabinet.Wen is the son of former premier Wu Bangguo (in this photo, right), who held the position from May 1995 to December 1997. Wu was replaced by Li Kexin, who was prime minister from 1997 to 2002 and then president again from 2002 to 2006.The official media did not	0
It's been a busy year for the British royal family. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall alone covered almost 48,000 miles to undertake 804 official engagements between April 2011 and the end of March this year. So urn was left with some time for relaxation before Christmas, when they headed off to Canada.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who have only been together for seven months, are heading to Canada too; but the trip will be the first time they have been to the country since their engagement in May. The visit is the perfect opportunity to catch up with family and friends over the holidays, and the opportunity to meet relatives in Canada for the first time."The Canadian trip is a big deal for me and my children, and is something that we have been looking forward to for a long time," the Duchess of Cambridge said in a rare interview with U.K. newspaper The Telegraph."I know that it will be a wonderful experience for our children — and I know that they will love it. I can't wait for them to see what Canada has to offer."The three-day visit will include visits to the Royal Museum at Kensington Palace, and to Mount Royal University, which the Duchess plans to visit on her own, as well as taking two days trip to Niagara Falls.It certainly seems like a pretty packed itinerary — it's a year since the duke was proclaimed as the new king of England, and his mother was crowned queen. Since then, they've had some pretty good news.Here's a look at four of the royal engagements that caught my attention this year, and three that really grabbed my attention more than they let on. Let's take a look at the highlights of 2012.As the Duchess of Cambridge's husband took the reigns on the throne with little ceremony in November, so did Princess Beatrice open the new Scottish Royal Family Centre in April. The centre will be used by children from the ages of three months up to about 16 years old to learn the basics of being a royal."One of the main objectives of this centre is to give children an insight into the life of a royal — the ups and downs, the challenges and the joys of being Queen Elizabeth's children," Kensington Palace confirmed.The Royal Collection in the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh has a new director, as well.

The last time Ben Affleck played a superhero, the world cried. The year was 2003, and the movie was "Daredevil" -- a Hollywood fail that even Affleck has insinuated he'd rather forget. So is it icky that the "Justice League" star was a star again in "Argo" -- a film that is a serious flop? No, of course not: it's not like the "Daredevil" era movie star was a household name or anything -- he was a director making his first big-budget Hollywood production. No, I mean it's not like Hollywood made him a big-time actor: he was an unknown comic book director-auteur fresh from the comic book studio.And yes, "Argo" does use the Superman name -- except, I guess if we're playing "Argo" as a "Watchmen" movie, it's more like "Argo" is a superhero comic-book movie. In fact, "Argo" feels like comic books -- and comic-book stuff is what movies like "Daredevil" had become by the time the first "Daredevil" movie debuted at the box office in 2002.The second "Daredevil" movie has proven to be as unappealing as the first movie was interesting (and not very interesting, it turns out). In a nutshell: it's just a superhero movie, a superhero that never took the time or resources to actually be a good one. But let's go into detail:This, to me, is the core problem with "Daredevil" as an actor: Ben Affleck has a natural talent for playing a tough guy. He's charismatic. He's funny. And he understands the character. The thing is, Ben Affleck isn't interested in playing a tough guy. Not seriously. That's how he got into the movies: comic book roles. Ben Affleck is the son of a small-town guy who did a job at the movies, and that made him a big-time movie star who became a superhero named after the character in the movie where he worked -- he played a tough guy. (Of course, the kid was actually from the suburbs, but the movie was in the Midwest, and Hollywood's "big and bad" were made in Hollywood.)"Argo" is a movie where Affleck has been cast as a tough guy. His role in "Argo"	0
London's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city, authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge. They even took the mast off the whopping vessel so it could squeeze underneath a motorway, with a gasp-inducing five centimeters to spare. The mast has now been reattached -- not that this five-storey floating hotel is going anywhere soon -- it doesn't even have an engine. "It took two weeks to tow it here from Finland," explains Elzbieta Nowacka, Sunborn events and sales manager, during a tour of the 102-meter-long boat. "To install an engine would have cost another Â£25 million ($44 million), so it was built without one on purpose." Float your boat The swanky superyacht now sits on the banks of east London's Royal Victoria Docks, and come late August it hopes to open its 136 rooms to the public, costing between $300 and $1,600 per night. Originally floating in conjunction with a luxury spa hotel in Finland, the vessel was given a refurbishment and tugged to the UK -- at a total cost of $67 million. "You cannot refer to these rooms as simply cabins," says Nowacka, opening the door to one of the top-of-the-range executive suites, featuring its own sauna and a balcony big enough for 20 people. "Not everybody can afford to go cruising on a superyacht, so this is a way of giving them a taste of how it could be." Stepping inside the plush lobby I'm greeted with a golden staircase, the twinkling light from the water outside reflected on its buffered surface. "A lot of people say it reminds them of the Titanic staircase," says Nowacka. "We've had quite a few requests from clients for Titanic-themed events," she adds, without a hint of irony. Space race In a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world, the Sunborn Superyacht Hotel has turned its gaze to London's many waterways -- and it's not the first European city in the company's sights. The company opened its $200 million Gibraltar hotel earlier this year, moored in the tiny territory located off the southern tip of Spain. There are also plans for another five-star ship in Barcelona.	1
The sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the law enforcement response has sparked a debate about what some call the "militarization of police," after armored vehicles, stun grenades and high-tech weaponry were brought in to calm the  unrest. The militarization of law enforcement, the argument goes, increases the likelihood that they will use excessive force in their interactions with civilians.One key difference in the debate is that opponents of the militarization of law enforcement often equate use of military equipment to the deployment of the military itself, and see military intervention in civilian affairs as an unacceptable violation of civil liberties. On the other side, proponents of the use of military equipment insist that the U.S. government can, and should, use its most powerful weapons to defend citizens caught in conflict. So which is the right answer?To gain a better understanding of how to answer that question, NPR talked to two public policy experts: Robert D.'Orto, the John M. Olin Distinguished Service Professor of Law at New York University School of Law, and James E. Ryan, a professor of law and political science at Arizona State University. Each of them has written extensively on the topic of militarization of law enforcement, either as a response to police brutality or as a step toward militarizing law enforcement in general.NPR: You've written extensively on the militarization of law enforcement. You both have said you don't agree, and there seems to be a difference of opinion among the experts on this one. Explain.Ryan: The militarization of law enforcement has been a response to the brutal excesses of police encounters with people of color in places like Baltimore and New York City. In Baltimore, the police response was a combination of military equipment and police use of that equipment to stop the beating and to detain people for prolonged periods. The police responded with an increase in the use of lethal force, which is a violation of the Constitution.My view is that at the heart of the problem was that the police department had no idea how to deal with the specific kind of conflict that they were having. They had a series of policies that were applied to the police in Baltimore, but they hadn't really made those policies clear, so it wasn't really possible to know what kind of response you'd get from the police in the kind of conflict that happened there.D'Orto: I don't agree that militarization of	0
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was released Sunday after four days in police custody in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army, police in Northern Ireland said. Adams, Â Ireland's only MLA, was released from a police station in Belfast after he was arrested under the Terrorism Act in connection with the killing of Margaret Paterson at her home in Portadown.Adams, who was released with no summons to present himself to the police, told reporters: "That is the most horrible thing I have ever heard. It is a great injustice of the highest kind." His release comes amid a renewed threat from the U.S. to take punitive action against Sinn Fein, after the IRA was linked to attacks on American service people in Northern Ireland. A U.S. military intelligence report said that the IRA had established "an unofficial connection" with a group of American soldiers returning from Iraq.The U.S. military intelligence summary said it believes the IRA is working with the U.S. military to conduct terrorism against U.S. military personnel deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The report said the group was working closely with U.S. forces and was "using their contacts with the U.S. military ... to facilitate terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq." It said the group was using a web of volunteers to do their dirty work. It said the IRA has links with both al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Mahdi Army in IraqGerry Adams, the only elected Sinn Fein leader and leader of Sinn Fein in parliament, was arrested on Saturday and questioned for hours by the U.S. military intelligence unit known as Task Force 110.The report issued Sunday was based on information from U.S. military and other sources inside Northern Ireland, some of which are believed to be leaked by the U.S. military itself.Army Secretary Peter Pace told CNN on Sunday that while the intelligence summary "is not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of all of the evidence," it was "very specific and detailed," and had been reviewed by the U.S. military's counter terrorism chief and top commanders in both the U.S. and Northern Ireland.The report, which was not made public, "represents one element of a complex intelligence picture," and the "specific details" contained in it are "the product of significant analysis," Pace	0
About 200 Kurdish demonstrators marched up a narrow Istanbul street behind a large banner that said "political prisoners are our pride, we will not stay silent over the deaths in prison." The group's organizers were expecting trouble. They were marching on Tuesday without a government permit. Barely 200 yards up the road, the crowd encountered a squad of armored Turkish riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road. Without any verbal warning, the vehicle lurched forward and unleashed its water cannon on the crowd. The demonstrators huddled behind their banner for a moment, until riot police unleashed a volley of tear gas canisters into the crowd. As stinging, acrid smoke engulfed the neighborhood, the middle-aged Kurdish demonstrators quickly gave way to masked youths hurling stones and fireworks at the police. Tuesday marked the second time in two days Turkish riot police used force against unsanctioned gatherings of political groups challenging the government. On Monday, security forces in Ankara used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse secularist groups trying to hold a rally celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish republic. Participants gathered in defiance of a government ban. The next day, Turkey's chief prosecutor announced he was launching an investigation into the secularist gathering. The crackdown during Republic Day in Ankara highlighted how powerless Turkey's once dominant secular establishment has become. It has also led to accusations by long-time supporters in Turkish newspapers that Turkey's Islamist-rooted prime minister is adopting the same authoritarian tactics of the secularist ancient regime. Tuesday's Kurdish clashes reflect a different power struggle. The riots in Istanbul and other Turkish cities mark yet another day in a bloody 30-year cycle of violence between the Turkish state and the Kurds. It is Turkey's oldest and deadliest ethnic conflict, one that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. The conflict developed a disturbing new dynamic in recent weeks as a mass hunger strike has spread through the Turkish penal system. According to the Turkish government statistics, at least 680 Kurdish prisoners are now starving themselves, some for nearly 50 days. "They want two things," said Gulcin Isbert, a member of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), which is Turkey's largest and best-organized Kurdish nationalist party. "The right to education and defense in court in their native language, and for the leader of the Kurds, Abdullah Ocalan, to have health, security and freedom."	1
Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.  The statement said Rowe "decided not to pursue a challenge to Katherine Jackson's custody."  The statement also admitted that Katherine Jackson's "past conduct" was part of the reason for not filing a complaint.The statement noted that Katherine Jackson could not "be legally considered to be an unfit parent." Katherine Jackson's lawyers said in a statement they did not comment on the details of the joint statement.On July 6, a judge in California approved Katherine Jackson's divorce from Michael Jackson.In September 2008, Katherine Jackson was arrested for driving under the influence and for her alleged involvement in a hit-and-run accident involving a police officer.The New York Times reported that Katherine Jackson was one of the most sought-after nannies for the children from the early 1990s to the early 2000s, but left after disputes arose at home and was replaced in the Jackson children's lives by a nanny named Sherry Stringer.In popular cultureA number of publications have written stories about Jackson or his family. Jackson's first marriage to Debbie Rowe was chronicled by Michael Ondaatje in his short memoir of the singer's early life. The children of Debbie Rowe, Lisa Marie, and Leondard Jack, with whom Jackson had three daughters as of 1998, were extensively discussed by Chris Rock in his HBO special "The Chris Rock Show". Rock reported that the oldest of the girls, Mariah, has been called "a mess", "a little spastic", and "a little girl who hates herself." Rock's second daughter, Cobie Smulders, was born on September 23, 1997, to the couple; during the show, Smulders had a serious accident on a school playground, which she was forced to have stitches for. Cobie grew up to become a model, in part due to the Jackson public image and media attention the child received. Cobie's second appearance in Rock's program, on September 20, became the inspiration for the character of Chante in Rock's show. The third Jackson child, Paris, was featured in articles as a "little girl" and "the most important thing in the world", after the deaths of Michael Jackson's other children	0
It's being called the most expensive divorce in the history of ... well, marriage. Russia's Dmitry Rybolovlev, 47, earned the dubious honor when Geneva, Switzerland's Court of First Instance  awarded his ex-wife, Svetlana Rybolovleva, an unprecedented amount of $3.4 million.That amount comes with a hefty gag order, as the court won't release details about a $2-billion (U.S.) divorce settlement the wealthy tycoon reportedly negotiated. In addition, the couple's former nanny, Tatyana Korsakova, will keep $30,000 from the settlement pot, according to The Moscow Times.Rybolovlev, a co-founder of the aluminum giant Rusal, divorced wife Svetlana after just five months of marriage. Rybolovlev and Svetlana, the daughter of a former Russian prime minister, fell in love as teenagers. The breakup was tumultuous, with Rybolovlev filing for divorce on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences" in May 2010. Svetlana, a model  and reality TV star, did not respond to claims that she tried to kill their two-year-old son.The couple's divorce was one of the greatest court cases of the year, coming after two years of acrimonious negotiations, according to The Moscow Times. In April, Rybolovlev hired his lawyers to represent Svetlana, reportedly settling on a total of $9.7 million. Their separation agreement, which the court is set to decide on in the upcoming week, is set to be signed on May 16.While the couple's divorce is unprecedented in its scale, the case isn't without precedent. In 2010, a French woman was awarded roughly $28 million for divorce, according to The New York Times. In 2012, a Russian businessman's ex-wife settled for $7 million, The Washington Post reports.But to date, the Rybolovlevs' case is the only one to feature a large settlement with a Russian billionaire, and only in the Swiss courts after a year-long battle.Read or Share this story: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/18/rybolovlev-wins-3-4-million-march-in-swiss	0
There was a plane ticket from Perugia, Italy, to Seattle, Washington, with Amanda Knox's name on it. Her parents bought it in the hope that Knox would be home for Christmas. They bought it as a leap of faith, hoping she would be legally vindicated of the allegation that she killed her roommate Meredith Kercher. They were tired of seeing their daughter's name plastered across newspapers around the world with the word murderer alongside it. But the ticket was never used. In December 2009, that ticket got shredded along with some of the hope her family was clinging to as she was hauled away as a convicted murderer from an Italian court. Now, as closing arguments in Amanda Knox's appeal come to an end, one thing remains the same for the Knox parents: A plane ticket home. They just hope they'll be able to use it this time. A fight to clear Amanda Knox's name In 2009, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas (they divorced in 1989) boarded a plane to Italy for the verdict in their daughter's murder trial. Hope pumped through their veins: a hope that an Italian court would see that their daughter was not a murderer. They were fighting a legal battle in which the odds were stacked unfairly against their daughter, according to many in Knox's camp. They were also fighting to preserve their daughter's image by countering what they felt was an unfair media caricature of their daughter as "Foxy Knoxy." The nickname, her parents said, was given to her in school because of her soccer skills, but during the murder trial it became a nickname to portray her as a careless, sex-crazed party girl. Her family told the story of an entirely different Amanda Knox: one who was "nonviolent" and "almost a passive person." Amanda Knox: From Seattle to Italy Prosecutors alleged at trial that on the night of November 1, 2007, at a small house in the college town of Perugia, Knox directed her then-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and a third defendant Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. They said the trio left her in a pool of blood and covered her with her own blanket. Knox's parents, like her defense attorneys, said their daughter was not involved in the murder and that evidence presented at trial was thin and clouded by shoddy police work.	1
Earlier this month, an AeroMexico plane made an important flight from Mexico City to Madrid. The flight wasn't notable for who was inside the cabin, but for what was inside the fuel tank: it was the world's first transatlantic commercial  passenger flight.That being said, while everyone on the ground was shocked by the flight taking off and landing on their continent, some in Mexico were not pleased with what they saw in the tank.The tank looked like it had been painted a bright shade of red, and it had a big circle drawn around it, indicating the fuel tank had been filled with fuel. But when the plane took off, the tank looked exactly the same, but when the plane landed, the tank looked like it had been filled with water.As it turns out, it was exactly as I thought: it was filled with water.The whole thing was the result of a new policy by the Mexican government: they're filling the tanks with water because they want to use the planes for oceanic flights, but not before allowing people to fly their planes wherever they want when they're filled with water.What this means for the flying public is that we're still flying in water.In fact, we're flying in water, but we're allowed to fly water planes instead of planes that have been approved to takeoff in water. This has happened because the Mexican government has decided that the water planes are a safer form of transport.Because the planes are filled with water, they are slower to fill with fuel in the air, so they have to use less fuel in the air, which reduces the fuel to fuel (F-ToF) ratios when they're on the ground and reduces the amount of damage to the wings.This means you're flying in water instead of normal air, so you're traveling slower and your fuel consumption is half. And so, because the fuel consumption ratio is so low on the water flights, the fuel consumption on the water flights is half as close to the fuel consumption ratio on the actual planes.So, the result is that you're flying in a safer form of transport, but you're flying to your destination in water instead of normal air.If you don't understand this, think about this: if you were driving a car but instead you were driving your car to your destination in water, then you wouldn't need a car at all, because	0
He was a beefy 5-foot-10 but won an Oscar for playing the slight, 5-foot-3 Truman Capote. He had the booming voice of a deity but often played schlubs and conflicted characters. He could be heartfelt and giving, as with his male nurse in "Magnolia" or rock critic in "Almost Famous," or creepily Machiavellian, such as the gamemaster in the latest "Hunger Games" movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman was an actor who could be anybody. "I don't know how he does it," director Mike Nichols told The New York Times Magazine in 2008. Nichols directed Hoffman on both stage ("The Seagull," "Death of a Salesman") and screen ("Charlie Wilson's War"). "Again and again, he can truly become someone I've not seen before but can still instantly recognize. ... He may look like Phil, but there's something different in his eyes. And that means he's reconstituted himself from within, willfully rearranging his molecules to become another human being." "Philip Seymour Hoffman's precise, uncanny performance as Capote doesn't imitate the author so much as channel him, as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds," wrote Roger Ebert about 2005's "Capote." Hoffman was found dead Sunday. Reports attribute his death to a drug overdose. For years, Hoffman was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public. He had an Everyman face -- burly enough to be an athlete, soft enough to be an artist, with an eye twinkle that could be either vicious (as in his "Mission: Impossible III" villain) or humorous (the frat-boyish Sandy in "Along Came Polly"). Consider the roles that earned him Academy Award nominations: a conniving writer ("Capote"), a cranky CIA desk jockey ("Charlie Wilson's War"), an upbeat, dissembling priest ("Doubt") and a charming, enigmatic cult leader ("The Master"). Or consider the ones that didn't: baseball manager Art Howe ("Moneyball"), suspicious Freddie Miles ("The Talented Mr. Ripley"), clever Plutarch Heavensbee ("The Hunger Games: Catching Fire").	1
A Delaware pediatrician has been indicted on 471 felony counts in the alleged sexual abuse of his patients, prosecutors announced  Wednesday.The charges, stemming from a five-year investigation by the Delaware attorney general’s office, came as a surprise to authorities.Dr. James C. Nokes, 46, had allegedly had affairs with as many as 150 woman, and also committed “multiple acts of child endangerment,” according to a criminal complaint filed Sept. 10, charging him with the crimes.The indictment charged that Nokes, of the 2000 block of North Courtland Drive in Wilmington, also had engaged in sexual relationships with five of his 6-year-old daughters, who were all under the age of 7 when he began having them.It stated that another adult woman, who was with Nokes, testified she became pregnant from an affair and gave birth to a fetus in September 2017 and a second in December, 2018.The complaint also says Nokes knew he was having sex with his patients, or that they had an abortion, because he told one of them there was “nothing wrong with my practice.”The report said there is no statute of limitations for an incest charge.Nokes was also charged with 20 counts of sexual offense in the third degree, including sexual abuse of three children younger than 10 years of age, who were under the legal age of consent, with intent to create a sexual relationship.His lawyer, Stephen M. Jaffe, called the allegations “baseless” in a statement. The statement did not address the incest charges, but said that Nokes is innocent of any sex crimes.Jaffe said he spoke to the prosecutor who asked him about the allegations but did not say a word about the incest charges.Jaffe said his client “is innocent of any conduct in which he is accused of engaging.”He said Nokes has “no comment other than to state that he is innocent.”The Delaware Attorney General’s Office declined to comment on any allegations of wrongdoing against Nokes.A doctor's office, a restaurant, a bank and a residential-complex apartment complex — all in the same neighborhood — were also targeted by a scammer who allegedly stole money from two elderly women who had recently died, police said Wednesday.The scammer	0

On a sultry spring day in 1965, silence descended on the packed crowd gathered at Australia's biggest sporting event. All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs. "The most beautiful girl in the world" had stepped out at Flemington Racecourse wearing a minidress five inches above her knees, with no hat, stockings or gloves. In an era when women didn't leave the house without wearing a hat, it was an outfit which both scandalized the nation and sparked a fashion revolution which would define the Swinging Sixties. As the Melbourne Cup prepares for its 52nd "Fashions on the Field" competition, the iconic image of Shrimpton in "that dress" has gained almost mythical status in the history of a horse race now worth $6.2 million in prize money. Known as "The race that stops a nation," it is one of the richest thoroughbred competitions in the world, and is so revered in its home state of Victoria that its annual date -- the first Tuesday in November -- has been made a public holiday. But in 1965 it was Shrimpton's legs which famously stopped the country in its tracks. "She was one of the world's first supermodels and her visit was highly anticipated -- everyone was expecting this beautiful hat and accessories," Victoria Racing Club Art and Heritage curator Penny Tripp told CNN. "When Jean came marching through the members' lounge two hours late with her boyfriend of the time -- Hollywood actor Terence Stamp -- in this casual dress, there was absolute silence." The conservative country was rocked by the seemingly skimpy outfit and, for the first time since the inaugural race in 1861, the winning horse was knocked off newspaper front pages -- in favor of Shrimpton's legs. "There she was, the world's highest-paid model, snubbing the iron-clad conventions at fashionable Flemington in a dress five inches above the knee, NO hat, NO gloves, and NO stockings!" screamed Melbourne newspaper The Sun.	1
On July 13, 2013, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin. The former neighborhood watchman never denied fatally shooting the unarmed teen, but he said he did so because he feared for his life. The intensely watched murder trial inspired passionate debate about race relations in America, gun laws, profiling and self-defense, and a good deal more. Here's where some of the key players are one year after the verdict. George Zimmerman Zimmerman has popped up a few times post-verdict. Just days after his acquittal, he helped rescue of a family of four from an overturned SUV. His wife, Shellie, filed for divorce in September, citing irreconcilable differences -- and in November, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend. Prosecutors dropped the case in December after Zimmerman's girlfriend recanted part of her story. Since then, he says, he has turned to painting as a "creative" way to express himself, and that he would like to pursue a legal career. In the meantime, he remains unemployed, and the nearly $500,000 raised online for his defense is at a near zero balance. The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into whether Zimmerman violated Martin's rights is still ongoing. Bids for George Zimmerman artwork top $100,000 Zimmerman's parents sue Roseanne Barr over tweets Judge Debra Nelson Nelson is still serving as a circuit judge in Seminole County, Florida. She had taken the Zimmerman case near the end of her one-year rotation in the criminal courts. After presiding over the high-profile trial, she went back to handling civil cases. Ironically, she presided at the related case Zimmerman v. NBC. She ruled recently that Zimmerman was not entitled to any money from the network, effectively dismissing his allegations that NBC portrayed him as racist by selective news editing. As of July 1, Nelson is back for another turn in criminal courts. Benjamin Crump	1
Brazil¹s Congress postponed a vote on Tuesday on a controversial forest code, which has pitted farmers and ranchers against environmentalists. According to state-run Agencia Brasil, the vote was rescheduled for next Tuesday so the government can try to secure support for the current text. Lawmakers are still sharply divided, with the rural lobby in Congress demanding more protection for farmers who have cleared land and environmentalists accusing the government of repealing landmark laws. Over the past decade, Brazil has cracked down on clear-cutting, especially in the biodiverse Amazon rain forest, reducing the rate of deforestation by 80%. Environmentalists are concerned that some of those gains could be threatened if the new legislation is passed. The bill eases limits on deforestation and extends an amnesty to some developers who cut down trees illegally in the past. Still, it is more eco-friendly than an earlier version of the bill that was supported by the rural lobby in Brazil¹s Congress. The Amazon rain forest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with about 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970. Initially cleared by loggers, much of it was turned into pastures and farmlands as Brazil went from being a food importer to a global agricultural powerhouse.	1
Finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers. Reaching the picturesque hinterland of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania is just the start. A two-hour boat ride across the vast waters of Lake Tanganyika follows. Finally, we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of Gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed. Peering through branches towards the canopies, we spy a mother and her two young boys feasting on palm nuts. It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall, the British primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family. Goodall, now 80 years old, would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and interactions of her subjects. The research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day, providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings. The magic of Gombe "The magic of Gombe is two factors," said Emily Boehm, a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, here to study the chimps. "It's the opportunity to be here with a well-habituated group of chimpanzees, to come into the forest every day with knowledgeable field assistants. It's (also) the long term data, because Jane Goodall started this study in the early 60s." "We have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now, and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them." Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe. There are an estimated 100 chimpanzees there today, broken up into three different communities. The group Goodall studied has the most, with around 60 members. Meat eaters Even after 50-plus years, researchers are still surprised by what they learn. Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat. This is a trait we observe as we watch a group of chimps  track Colobus monkeys swinging in the trees above them. We also see another industrious bunch fashion tools to try dislodge termites from beneath a mound.	1
Authorities have arrested a man they say was the leader of a kidnapping cell responsible for kidnapping,  and raping, a 13-year-old girl four times over the course of about 6 months in an apartment in Portland.Police say that during the investigation, they learned that the man, identified as Joshua Brown, was not just an "innocent victim" as a friend of the victim suggested — he also knew details about the abductions and rapes.The girl told police Brown, who then lived in the apartment complex, knew her family, which was located near the scene of the last two abductions. During the last two abductions, he also threatened the girl's family with a gun.According to an arrest affidavit, on the night of Jan. 6, he followed the girl as she walked home to her family's apartment. He told her to come back outside with him to talk about her family issues, but instead she got a ride with another man.But when they got back outside, the girl said Brown was armed with a gun and had her and her abductor pinned to the ground. The two men then sexually assaulted the girl and took her to a second location. The man then pulled out a gun and threatened the girl's family.The girl told police she was able to escape the second time. Brown then told the girl she would be arrested for a "bad act." But she was safe because Brown knew the "bad act" was the next morning's police reports would not mention the abuse allegations or the fact that the woman was actually being sexually assaulted at the second location.Later that night, the suspect texted a friend to alert him the police were looking for her. He also sent a friend to the location where she saw him following her the day before asking where she was. Then he called the friend to say he had her, according to the affidavit.The girl told police Brown's identity was known to two friends in the neighborhood who had been communicating with him, and the suspect had been sending them texts and photos with "inappropriate" messages.During the investigation, police learned a man with a gun, whom police later identified as Joshua Brown, was responsible for the six incidents of sexual abuse, and three rapes, on the 13-year-old girl, and that one of the men allegedly threatened the girl's family with a gun.During the investigation, the girl's	0
A group of architects gathered in Oxford, England last month with an unusual brief -- to design the ultimate dream home for bats. The winged mammals are valued from an ecological viewpoint for preying on insects, dispersing seeds and pollination. But their numbers have declined dramatically in North America, where a fungal disease called white nose syndrome is estimated to have killed more than 5.5 million. In the United Kingdom, the fungus has yet to appear, but habitat destruction remains a major threat. Policy-makers in the UK have stepped in to protect bat populations, criminalizing any interference with their roosts, even if no bats are currently present. "If you have bats roosting in your building, you can't disturb them in any way without getting a special license," says Kelly Gunnell, Built Environment Officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, a charitable organization in London, England. Those who interfere with a roost risk a fine of $7,800 per bat, and up to six months in prison -- although Gunnell says no one has been sent to prison yet. The new, three-hour course, offered by the Royal Institute of British Architects in conjunction with the Bat Conservation Trust, is intended to educate architects about bats, teaching participants the ideal size, access points, temperature, materials and location for bat roosts. "They need to design these spaces which are biodiversity-friendly, but they're not ecologists," explains Gunnell. "This gives them a basic introduction to their life cycle, when they breed, and their requirements for roosting." Bats prefer to roost in natural features like trees and caves, but as development has made those environments scarcer, some species have adapted to urban areas. "Only about half the bats here regularly use buildings as roosts, although nearly all of them will use them at some stage," says Gunnell. "Unfortunately, with a lot of people doing loft conversions and barn conversions, that's had a huge impact. Bats only have one young a year, and they don't have them every year, so if they were using your roof loft as their maternity roost and you knocked down the building or put in a loft extension, it would wipe out that whole population." Research ship finds the world's oceans are 'plasticized' Bats present several logistical challenges for designers.	1
If you want to see the impact of Iran's growing power in the Middle East, look no further than Syria. On Monday, three important developments occurred simultaneously: First, world diplomats scrambled anxiously to salvage plans for a conference on Syria scheduled to start on Wednesday. The "Geneva II" meeting almost went off the rails before it began, with Syrian opposition leaders threatening to stay away unless the United Nations retracted the invitation it had unexpectedly extended to Iran. At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale "systematic torture and killing" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally. The report's authors said the new evidence could prove al-Assad and his regime are guilty of perpetrating crimes against humanity. And in the third major event of that day, the interim nuclear deal between Iran and world powers went into effect. Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran. Opinion: Syrian genocide needs justice These three events will be included by historians and analysts when they write the story of the turmoil of the early 21st century Middle East. They will note that this was a week that showed the consequences of Iran's gradually rising influence, as the Islamic Republic moved steadily toward its goal of becoming the dominant power in the region. Not long ago, the dictator al-Assad appeared on the verge of losing power to a popular uprising. President Barack Obama declared he "must get out of the way." But his regime's loyal allies in Tehran sent in reinforcements. At the urging of its Iranian patrons, Lebanon's Shiite militia, Hezbollah, moved its forces across the border into Syria, helping to turn the tide of the war and adding to its increasing radicalization. The war went from a grassroots democratic movement to a brutal showdown between Sunni extremists -- whose strongest elements now include al Qaeda fighters -- against Shiite forces loyal to Iran and al-Assad. Now the Syrian war, which has displaced millions of civilians and has killed more than 130,000, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, is spilling into Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere. It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence.	1
McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming "I'm Lovin' It" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix "Mc" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. "We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over," said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. "We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's." The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. "We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court," Suppiah said. "We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food." The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix "Mc" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the "Mc" in McCurry stands for "Malaysian Chicken Curry." A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. "We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment," said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: "Tasty and so Gooood."	1
President Barack Obama on Tuesday expressed hope that Libya's opposition movement, given new protection by a U.S.-led military mission, can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust Moammar ÂQaddafi.In remarks in Washington, Obama praised the Libyan National Army, the Libyan people and the Libyan revolution. Libyan officials and opposition activists said the new U.S. protection was significant in easing the military presence of the United States as it seeks to protect its mission in Libya.“Now, in order to be effective, we will have to find ways to integrate the security forces who are there into the Libyan people so that they can stand alongside them as part of a new and sovereign democratic government,” Obama said, without elaborating.The U.S. military mission in Libya is limited to the area around the city of Benghazi. The United States has provided support to the Libyan National Army, which is made up of the Libyan Defense Force, the new Libyan National Army Defense Forces, the Libyan Local Protection Forces and the Special Security Service.The U.S. military mission is not open to Libyan civilians, a U.S. official said Tuesday. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said recently that no one would be allowed to cross the U.S. military's "no-fly" zone, an area around Benghazi which is about 20 miles wide.Obama emphasized the new Libya would have to rebuild its economy and create an environment that allows for democracy, transparency and rule of law.“Libya can become a model for other nations, including the United States, whose own recent experiences with civil wars and the kind of extremist violence that now threatens the country can serve as a cautionary tale,” Obama said. “As we begin to build a more just Libya, we remain determined that no one should have to live in fear."The United States has already stepped up military aid to the Libyan government of Moammar ÂQaddafi but has not supplied the rebel forces in their war to oust him. Obama is hoping that the Libyan rebels can be a model for democracy.A senior U.S. official said Tuesday Libyan opposition leaders are considering ways to address concerns that the new government will take power before conditions for democracy are in place.The official said the opposition wants to see that the transition to democracy under the new leadership is one that includes both democratic	0
Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, formerly served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of  counterterrorism and international terrorism. She is the author of the New York Times bestselling book "The Terror Presidency: Inside the White House and the Rise of the War on Terror." The following is an edited excerpt from her forthcoming book, "Under One Roof: The Obama White House, the CIA, and the Bin Laden Puzzle."(CNN) -- I am a reporter. When I was a young woman, writing a college paper on the CIA's first year in action, I was informed of the CIA's need for secret messages of clandestine operation. Now, it is well known that the CIA has been able to disseminate its intelligence throughout the world through clandestine operations. But it seems that this information has also helped to create this nation's first terror emergency and been passed on to many within the U.S. government who may have helped, either knowingly or unknowingly, to create this crisis.A year after 9/11, I read about a terrorist plot perpetrated in part by the CIA, which had to be prevented. The plot was foiled by the actions of the FBI, which made numerous attempts to intercept and foil the plot. For a time, it seemed that President George W. Bush's administration was unable to get ahead of the terrorist plot.On Sunday, President Obama will make the most dramatic move of his presidency towards a comprehensive plan to stop the next terrorist attack in the United States, and on Wednesday night, the American people will decide whether they should have that plan in place in the first place.I fear very much that our president may be tempted to rely on covert and covert actions against the Muslim community to prevent more terrorist attacks. For all those who have suffered an attack perpetrated by Muslim radicals, I urge you to speak up and let our leaders know how you feel. Your voice goes to the heart of this country.I am not talking here about my own experience of being on the receiving end of the terrorist's hand of death. Instead, I am talking about the acts of violence by Muslim extremists that have taken their lives and caused the loss of countless others by their own hand. It is that kind of violence for which the United States is being asked to respond.In the wake	0
Over the years, I've seen a good many meetings between U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers on big issues during critical moments. It usually takes a few days before we can begin to make sense of what occurred and what to  say about it. Often, the subject is more complex, and the meeting itself is more of an exercise in trying to help the two governments figure out how to work together rather than a meeting in which specific issues are addressed in detail.The most recent meeting between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu was a remarkable one. It wasn't really about the Middle East at all; it was about Obama's vision of what his presidency would look like. As Obama told me, "I came to Israel with a very clear intention: I would meet in part because I wanted to develop a vision for my presidency, and I wanted to find the way forward with Israel that would not only be practical, but also reflect values about which I agreed with the prime minister."It was a meeting of two minds with very different visions of how change should happen and the best way to achieve it.Israelis, on the other hand, came away from the meeting, with one obvious conclusion: The prime minister is right. He was right in his assessment that he had made enormous progress that has directly led to the easing of tensions between the United States and Iran.As Obama made his way to a reception in Tel Aviv before heading back to Washington, he asked many questions and he listened to the answers. He asked about the new Iran nuclear deal, and he asked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He asked about the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem and he asked about the U.S. role in a nuclear Iran. He asked about Israeli-Palestinian peace. And he found out that I had done a whole lot of the work in my book, The Arab-Israeli Conflict (Free Press, 1992), in which I describe the Arab governments' growing acceptance that a U.S. military strike against Iran was not only possible, but even probable.While we didn't get to talk about those issues—Iran nuclear and Israeli-Palestinian peace—we did find time to talk about one other issue that was on our radar screen, and that was the fact that the U.S. military is now on the Israeli border in the first-ever deployment of a U.S. combat unit in the West Bank.Before	0
Most Pakistanis told pollsters they disapproved of the U.S. military operation that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the direction their country was headed, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. In all, nearly two-thirds (63%) expressed disapproval of the raid, while only 10% said they approved of it. In addition, about half of Pakistanis (51%) said they think the May 2 raid on bin Laden's home in Abbottabad will adversely affect their country's relations with the United States. Just 4% said they think relations will improve. Nevertheless, most Pakistanis said they would like to see a strong relationship between the countries. But a survey taken just after the raid found no material change in Pakistanis' views of the United States when compared with results from a survey taken before the raid. Only 12% of respondents said they had a positive view of the United States and 8% said they were confident that U.S. President Barack Obama would do the right thing in world affairs. Obama's approval numbers are no better than those of then-President George W. Bush in 2008. In a poll taken after bin Laden's death, more than two-thirds (69%) said they think of the United States as more of an enemy. But that figure is not significantly higher than the 68% who said the same thing in a poll before his death. China's government stirred warmer feelings, with just 1% of Pakistanis identifying it as an enemy. Those surveyed said they were confused about the role of the Pakistani government in the U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, which is located about 35 miles outside the capital city of Islamabad. Asked whether they believe the Pakistani government authorized the raid, 29% said it did, 23% said it did not and nearly half said they did not know. U.S. officials have said they did not consult with their Pakistani counterparts prior to the raid. Fewer than one in five Pakistanis (18%) said they think the government did know that bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, 29% said they did not think so and more than half (53%) had no opinion.	1
Australian authorities ended their efforts to find survivors Friday after a boat carrying scores capsized off the coast of Indonesia this Ã¢â‚¬Å“sounds like a movieÃ¢â‚¬Â of a week-long search off the coast of Christmas Island in the South Pacific, the BBC reported.Australia's search for the missing became a Hollywood nightmare Friday when searchers found the boat, which had withstood several days in choppy waves and storms, listing to one side.The boat, found with its hull a quarter-mile from shore, was completely submerged in some places, the AFP news agency reported. There were no survivors.The boat was carrying about 20 tourists traveling on a seven-night tour to Australia's tropical island capital, Perth, which is known for its great natural beauty, from Phuket, Thailand.The passengers included British man Richard Ratcliffe, a 45-year-old computer systems analyst who was visiting his wife. He and his wife, from South Wales, boarded the boat from Phuket late on Thursday. Their tour was expected to include visits to tropical beaches and islands and a visit to the famous rock formation Victoria Land."We are absolutely devastated by the news we have just heard," the family said in a statement issued in a Thailand hospital on Friday. "Richard and our family are doing well, however we would ask for privacy at this difficult time."The vessel was reportedly carrying a group of 17 people who had been traveling together for some time.The news conference in Perth was a hastily called one after search and rescue vessels began their efforts in Phuket but had limited luck.Police told the Australians that some were reported last Thursday when they went to investigate a motorboat believed to be involved in the disappearance."We've been trying to get into communication with them (the passengers) for some time and are disappointed that they have not responded to our efforts," Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said.The boat had a crew of five, including three Australians and a Thai, according to the BBC. The vessel would have been about 5 meters (19 feet) in length, the Associated Press reported.More than 250 officials, including army, police and navy members, are searching for the passengers. The search was joined by a joint Indonesian military team, police and coast guards."	0
As hosts of the largest carnival in world football, the pressure is on for South Africa's national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the 2010 World Cup. If Bafana Bafana is to succeed in their ersatz "golden generation" mission, and to stand up to a very tough competition in the Asian Football Confederation, a new generation of players is required. South Africa will almost certainly have to rely on two of the country's greatest players, both of whom are on the cusp of their 40-year-old prime, to play a key role, for the Bafana to rise from the ashes of the 2002 World Cup.In this edition of the World Cup in Review, we look at the emergence of those young Bafana stars, the impact they will have on the tournament, and the importance of youth development. In today's preview, the focus shifts to the next generation of South African football.Jo-Wilfried TsongaJo-Wilfried Tsonga is arguably the best footballer in the country in the age group that he has to face, and he has already been a key figure for the Bafana, since he was part of the national team that beat Argentina 4-1 in the 2002 World Cup in Germany.A young Tsonga was at the age of 18 when he played for the national team in the FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina and Chile, where South Africa came third in the tournament. A young Tsonga starred in the 2007 AFCON, which would be his first taste of senior international action.Tsonga was the star of the 2009 African Nations Cup in Ghana and Nigeria, scoring two goals in two matches, as South Africa came fourth.South Africa's 2010 World Cup squad: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (left), Bongani Khumalo, Eto N'yoni, Japheth Sarr, Steven van der Dijk, Andre Ebong, S’bu Nkosi, Duane Vermeulen, Dzenis de Burgos, Mark-Anthony Kaye, Stephan Eriksen, Raul Jorda, Eamon Zayed, Andres Iniesta, André Schürrle.As the player of the tournament, Tsonga was the first recipient of the African Footballer of the Year award for 2009, when he scooped up the prize in the	0
In the wake of criticism over a two-game suspension for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, the NFL has established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Commissioner Roger Goodell said "I have taken a hard look at the Rice matter and determined it warrants discipline -- a suspension, and that suspension should be for a minimum of six games."Goodell made his statement Monday immediately following a day of testimony from witnesses and experts that questioned a decision by the NFLPA to accept Rice's explanation for why he allegedly assaulted his then-fiancee Janay Palmer on Thanksgiving Day in 2012.Goodell and the NFL have heard testimony from many witnesses over the past two days about the facts of Rice's case, Rice's statement, and the role that the NFLPA, an NFL-lobbying organization, played in the case. Several witnesses have suggested that the Rice incident was not the only incident Rice had with Palmer prior to the 2012 incident. Goodell has said the matter is being investigated further.Palmer has maintained that her relationship with Rice was an innocent one."You know, these things happen," Goodell said. "We have to make sure when we address these issues that we are consistent on the way we do it and don't use this and other situations as precedent to have other situations addressed. That's the appropriate thing we did here."According to Goodell, players like Rice and the other accused players are responsible for ensuring they comply with the rules and regulations of their profession by taking training and education courses, getting counseling, not engaging in violence, and addressing their personal life before entering professional football."We're going to make sure whenever we address these things, we're consistent in the way we do it," Goodell said. "These are professionals. They are responsible for making sure they have all the resources and the education and all the training they need before they ever take an oath and that they fulfill a commitment of discipline in the game of football and that they abide by the rules and regulations of the game of football before they enter into that profession."Goodell said he did not believe players who violate the rules and regulations of their profession should be penalized for doing so."I think when we look at it, the responsibility is on the individual, the individual should stand down and say I'm wrong. I've done something wrong," Goodell said.	0
A U.S. drone strike Wednesday morning killed at least 10 militants and injured 14 near the Afghan-Pakistani border, a Pakistani military official said. The attack targeted militants in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It wasn't immediately clear which militant group or groups were targeted. Haroon Zarghoon, a spokesman of a armed resistance movement, Hizb-e-Islami Afghanistan, said his group was not affected. But, citing his group's fighters in the region, he said one attack was in the Afghan province's Nazyan district, 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3 kilometers) from the border with Pakistan. Targets included smugglers who had been using an alternate route for bringing goods to Pakistan on foot, Zarghoon said. One strike occurred in Pakistan's Tirah Valley, according to residents in the area. However, the Pakistani military official maintained that the attacks happened only in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's Nangarhar province borders Pakistan's loosely governed tribal region. Nine facts about armed drones Attack on Afghanistan-Pakistan border police kills 3 A few hundred miles to the southwest, two suicide bombers and three other insurgents attacked a border police post in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province on Wednesday evening, killing three police officers and injuring five other people, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, Taliban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi said. The two suicide bombers wore women's burqas, Sediqi said. After they blew themselves up, police killed the other three attackers, he said. The attack happened around 8 p.m. in Kandahar's Spin Boldak district near the border with Pakistan. CNN's Aliza Kassim and Masoud Popalzai and journalist Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report.	1
The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity. After sunset, the only light in one corner cafe came from two candles. Their flickering glow barely lit the faces of men seated at a handful of tables, where they were breaking their Ramadan fast. Nearby, residents trudged down the center of empty streets enveloped in darkness. Some men played music from parked cars. Others sat silently in doorways, their presence only marked by the glow of a cigarette butt. "It's a disaster. My father's neighborhood hasn't had electricity for five straight days," said one Libyan man who asked not to be named, for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities. He said he evacuated his entire family to Egypt and was staying behind to keep an eye on his property. The rapid deterioration of power supplies in Tripoli over the past two weeks has come as a shock to many Libyans. Some residents complain pumps have stopped channeling water to their apartment buildings, leaving them without both water and light. This week, a nightly talk show that fiercely supports Moammar Gadhafi on state television addressed the growing problem of the black-outs. "The Tripoli power cuts are caused by NATO and rebel attacks on power stations," announced a television presenter on Thursday. Frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference, when a Libyan man repeatedly pressed Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on why some Tripoli neighborhoods had power while others suffered black-outs for days. "Surely a large country like Libya doesn't depend on one power station," the Libyan man said. Kaim responded by accusing NATO warplanes and Libyan rebels of attacking power stations, high-voltage lines and pipelines. In an e-mail to CNN, NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines. "There is no evidence to suggest that if the country's power lines have been damaged, such an event could be linked to a NATO strike," the spokesman wrote. The Gadhafi regime is struggling under an international blockade of its seaports and airports. Shortages of gas have been a fact of daily life for months now, with drivers waiting days in line at gas stations for fuel.	1
A major investor in convicted swindler Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme drowned in his swimming pool in Florida after a heart attack, his attorney said Monday. The medical examiner's office confirmed the report. Jeffry Picower, 67, was found unconscious in his pool shortly after noon Sunday at his Palm Beach,  Florida,, home by his wife, Palm Beach police said. He was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital. Picower's attorney, William Zabel, told CNN that Picower drowned after suffering a massive heart attack. Sue Jaffe, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County medical examiner, confirmed those details. In September, Forbes magazine ranked Picower No. 371 among the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $1 billion. In March, Madoff was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty to 11 felony counts of fraud, money laundering and perjury. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors. When the Picower Foundation of Palm Beach announced it was shutting down early this year because of Madoff losses, it initially appeared that the prominent philanthropist had been an unfortunate victim of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Picower's 2007 tax return had valued his foundation's portfolio at $955 million. However, in May, court filings by Madoff trustee Irving Picard changed the picture. The trustee's complaint claimed that Picower had been a key beneficiary of Madoff's Ponzi scheme for more than 20 years, and "knew or should have known that [he] was profiting from fraud because of the implausibly high rates of return" on his accounts. Those "anomalous and astronomical rates of return" -- as high as 500 percent in one year and 950 percent in another year -- "were neither credible nor consistent with legitimate trading activity, and should have caused any reasonable investor ... to inquire further," the court filings said, referring to Picower as "a sophisticated investor, accountant and lawyer." Citing backdated account filings and other bogus paperwork, the complaint contends that "Picower and the other defendants also knew or should have known that they were reaping the benefits of manipulated purported returns, false documents and fictitious profit."	1
When Apple unveiled not one but two new iPhones last month, it was the dawning of a new strategy for the company, which for six years had championed its single iconic smartphone even as competitors rolled out an ersatz copy based on every popular screen size that Apple would produce.In its place, Apple chose to launch a series of smaller yet even more powerful phones that could be held, and used, more like tablets than smartphones. But as with the move from iPhone to iPad, it was an odd one. The new phones, which look just like the current crop of iPhones, feature what Apple calls "super power" cameras, dual-band, 4G LTE cellular connectivity, and the same high-resolution displays that are used on the iPhone. But they’re smaller and lighter than the iPhone, so they’re not as bulky. They’ve been built by Samsung and LG, each of which will make a few million of them over several years, priced competitively with competing phones. And they’ve been designed to run exclusively on iOS.That’s a strategy Apple had tried in the past. As recently as 2007, it tried the same thing in the form of the iPhone 3GS, which looked a lot like the 4-inch phone it had just unveiled. But the failure of that phone led Apple to rethink it, and the new strategy now seems to work.For all the talk of a new beginning, it’s becoming increasingly clear the new strategy is Apple’s last. As recently as 2012, some analysts were predicting the new iPhone would be Apple’s last hardware launch. Two years later, though, those days appear to be past. For one thing, the iPhone 4S is a better-sorted product than the iPhone 3GS ever was. It is, technically, a successor to the iPhone 3GS. The 3GS was released in June 2007, so it has been nearly seven years since Apple launched the latest iPhone, which came out in September 2010.For another, Apple has lost a third of its market share in the last six months. Even Apple’s two most successful products, the iPad and the Apple Watch, have lost market share in Apple Watch sales in the last year. Some analysts are predicting even worse results in the third quarter of this year, when the launch of the third version of the iPad is expected.That�	0
FIFA approved tougher penalties for racist behavior, including possible relegation, in a move that one anti-racism organization said will bring soccer "in line" with other sports. The sanctions, FIFA revealed at its congress in Mauritius on Friday, come in two stages. They were initiated at a time when incidents of racism continue to make headlines around the world and several months after FIFA set up an anti-racism task force. Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed "serious," could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament. Soccer's global governing body also said that any individual committing a racist infraction should be suspended for at least five matches. It's now up to FIFA's member associations, who number more than 200, to implement the new punishments. Only one member -- it wasn't known which one -- voted against the measures. "There have been despicable events this year that have cast a long shadow over football and the rest of society," FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. "I am speaking of the politics of hate -- racism, ignorance, discrimination, intolerance, small-minded prejudice, that uncivilized, immoral and self-destructive force that we all detest." Kevin-Prince Boateng of A.C. Milan walked off in protest when he was racially abused during a friendly in January, and Greece's football federation banned AEK Athens' Giorgos Katidis for five games in April and fined him for a Nazi-style goal celebration. Kick It Out, the anti-racist body, welcomed Friday's development. "It is something the organization has been campaigning on, and stricter punishments for discrimination more generally, for many years," chair Lord Herman Ouseley said on Kick It Out's Web site. "We hope to see the practical implications of this ruling. "FIFA is setting an example to bring football in line with other sports which don't have problems around discrimination and unacceptable behavior." Meanwhile, FIFA announced three women would take their place on the executive committee, which votes, for instance, on where the World Cup is held.	1
Zooey Deschanel is bringing her quirky style to a Macy's near you. The "New Girl" star has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to create a 16-piece clothing collection called "To Tommy, From Zooey," which is scheduled to arrive in stores this spring. Items like coats and peek-a-boo print dresses will be priced between $98 and $199. Several pieces combine '60s mod silhouettes with color-blocking and nautical accents, a look the actress describes as "Modical." According to a release from Hilfiger's press team, the line "captures the buoyant attitude of the sixties, the decade in which Hilfiger made his fashion debut and from which Deschanel borrows her doe-eyed look." "Working with Tommy on this capsule collection has been really amazing," Deschanel said. "I am a fashion fanatic and I am always looking for new ways to incorporate vintage, feminine pieces into my own wardrobe. Tommy and I share many of the same inspirations â€” old school music, classic films and old Hollywood icons â€” and his guidance during the design process helped to put a really unique twist on each piece." "Each piece is original and fun," added Hilfiger. "The collection is the perfect fusion of Zooey's adventurous style and the classic, cool, American spirit at the heart of the Tommy Hilfiger brand." The "To Tommy, From Zooey" line will be sold in over 200 Macy's stores and Tommy Hilfiger outposts in North America, Europe, Mexico and Japan starting April 14th. (A selection of handbags and jewelry will follow later in the month.) The actress will promote the collection by appearing at events in New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico and will also appear in an ad campaign shot by photographer Carter Smith.

Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. El-Sisi's recent presidential bid reveals a tenacious attempt of the Egyptian military to consolidate power and  remove President Mohamed Morsi. The current government is a coalition of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Salafist Nour Party and the liberal, secular, left-wing Dostour Party backed by Egypt's secular nationalist Islamist movement known as the Muslim Brotherhood. It is also significant that in 2013, Egypt's military chief of staff, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was selected to lead the military junta following the June 2012 coup which deposed Morsi. This coup was triggered by a military mutiny led by General Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi in June 2012, days after he became deputy chief of Egyptian military operations. The military was subsequently able to consolidate their power without popular support. These military junta and president are seeking to consolidate their power and control the region. The Egyptian military is becoming more powerful and more aggressive.In this chapter, we will explore the main events and themes that have shaped and informed the politics and society of Egypt. We will look into the rise of the military junta and how this was used by the former dictator, Mubarak to retain power; the rise of El-Sisi as a new military dictator; and the Muslim Brotherhood’s rise to power over the last two decades. We will also look into the rise of the secular nationalist movement the Muslim Brotherhood in relation to Egyptian society and politics.The rise of the Muslim BrotherhoodThe rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt can be traced back to the late 1950s when Nasser's Egypt was on the path to nation building and economic success. Nasser, in his quest to build an Islamic state led by Islam and Islam in the heart of the ‘Green Line’ of the Arab world, allowed religious freedoms to flourish throughout the country. Nasser also saw the country as an example and a model for Islamism and the Middle East, as he believed Egypt was the most Islamic state in the Middle East. Nasser's secular nationalist vision was built on the idea that Egypt would be a beacon for the region and a model for what Egypt should be. These ideas were furthered by the young Muslim Brothers of the Muslim Brothers Organization and in later times as a result of the mass protests	0
A self-described "ex-madam" who claims she supplied fellow city comptroller candidate Eliot Spitzer with escorts several years ago is facing charges of illegally distributing prescription drugs, authorities said. Kristin Davis, 38, was arrested on Monday night and charged with selling Adderall, Xanax and other drugs. She's also accused of orchestrating the sale of approximately 180 oxycodone pills for cash. The candidate was released Tuesday on $100,000 bail, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for September 5. Prosecutors said she will have strict pretrial supervision. "Prescription drug abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in this country, resulting in more overdose deaths than heroin and cocaine combined, and this office has a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who helps to spread this plague at any level," Preet Bharara, Manhattan U.S. Attorney, said in a statement. Spitzer, Weiner and why New York is talking about sex Davis is charged with four counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. She faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count, if convicted. Prosecutors allege that from 2009 through 2011 Davis bought ecstasy pills, Adderall pills and Xanax pills from an FBI cooperating witness at least once a month, paying hundreds of dollars for each purchase. She told the witness she provided these drugs to people at house parties, authorities say. An attorney for Davis was could not be immediately reached for comment. Davis' campaign manager, Andrew Miller, said he was aware of the arrest but couldn't provide any information. Has the road to redemption gotten shorter? Based on information from the FBI's witness, the FBI set up a sting operation from January through March of this year, in which Davis sold pills on three separate occasions to the witness, who she believed to be a drug dealer, the complaint states. Davis became synonymous with the prostitution scandal involving Spitzer, then serving as governor. She has no proof of her arranging escorts for Spitzer, but she did spend four months behind bars because of her business. Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008. A former hedge fund senior vice president, Davis is running as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City. CNN's Jesse Solomon and Mark Preston contributed to this report.	1
Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka "Ginormica,"  is on a killing spree, and she's making her way to the streets of New York City to kill one person in particular. Will she succeed, or will she get killed by the people of New York as she runs through the streets?When Susan, a tiny girl who lives in a dream world as she travels through the city on her bike, comes across a house that turns out to be owned by someone named Tony, she sneaks inside. Tony and his son Tony Jr. have a great time until Susan, who loves Tony just as he is, is sent back to the dream world and has to find a way to return to Earth.The story in all of this is fairly simple, and it moves quickly. In this case, though, the simplicity of the story is an unintended part of the success of the movie in general. While the film is an incredibly boring, one-note affair (with very little to set it apart from the endless parade of similar movies to be found with that title), it is very clever in other ways. It creates the feeling of a movie that is an entirely different story, which can go one of two ways. The first is that the original story is an uninteresting one, and simply becomes a background feature to show the transition from the dream to reality. The second is that the movie has an original idea, one that is only hinted at over its first half or so.This happens in the first half, when Susan is on her way to find and kill one person and then heads back to the dream and is surprised that the dream world, that was the setting of the story from the beginning, is a better place, with a more prosperous and well-developed economy. However, it does get worse, as when she returns to find the city in chaos, in the final third, the original story is explained, and the movie suddenly becomes much more interesting.The movie introduces the viewer to the character of Tony, and his son, Tony Jr. There is a great sense of family here, and the two of them have been very well-written, as it is difficult to take your eyes from them. Susan's personality is interesting,	0
Tomas Berdych has hovered around the edge of the "big four" of men's tennis for the past three years, but on Sunday he will take center stage in what could be a historic moment for his country. The Czech Republic has not won the Davis Cup since its split from Slovakia in 1993, but its men's team are poised follow up its women's success in the Fed Cup after taking a 2-1 lead in the final against defending champions Spain. The women retained their title in the tournament's 50th staging, and the men are battling to follow up Czechoslovakia's sole 1980 victory as the 100th edition of the Davis Cup comes to a climax in Prague. "That's all we wanted," Berdych said after helping Radek Stepanek to defeat the ATP World Tour Finals champion partnership of Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez 3-6 7-5 7-5 6-3 in Saturday's doubles rubber. "We are still missing a lot, it's just one point, but we are looking ahead and we will do everything." Jubilant Czechs clinch 'amazing' Fed Cup title defense Berdych is ranked sixth in the world in singles play, and 119th in doubles, but he has come to the fore in the Davis Cup this season with 10 wins from 10 matches. Friday's victory over Nicolas Almagro, which leveled the final, was his first over a Spanish player after three previous defeats -- including the 2009 final when the Czechs were whitewashed 5-0 in Barcelona. On Sunday he will play fifth-ranked David Ferrer, who has a leading seven tournament titles this year and 74 match wins -- second only behind world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Ferrer has a 22-4 record in Davis Cup matches, including Friday's win over Stepanek, and he holds a 5-3 career advantage in matches against Berdych. Ferrer is also unbeaten in Davis Cup action this year, and is leading the Spanish team in the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal. If he beats Berdych in their first encounter this year, then the final will hinge on the fifth rubber between 37th-ranked Stepanek and world No. 11 Almagro. Almagro has an 8-3 Davis Cup record, but did not feature in last year's final or his country's triumphs in 2004, 2008, and 2009.	1
Scores of emergency personnel on Thursday helped battle a fire that burned a docked Russian nuclear submarine, state media reported. Wooden scaffolding caught fire Thursday afternoon at a repair dock in Roslyakovo, which is in the Murmansk region in northwest Russia along the Barents Sea, the official Itar-Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The flames spread to hull of the nuclear submarine Yekaterinburg, where work had been underway. About 100 emergency personnel responded, using 40 pieces of firefighting and other equipment to spray foam and water to douse the blaze, the regional emergency ministry said according to Itar-Tass. Gov. Dmitry Dmitrienko said that the submarine's nuclear reactors were then shut down and there was no threat of radiation spreading, the news agency reported. Capt. Vadim Sega, a spokesman for Russia's northern fleet, added that the fire never penetrated the hull and got inside the ship. "There is no possibility of fire burning through the hull, and no threat to on-board equipment," Sega said Thursday, according to RIA-Novosti. The emergency ministry said Thursday that there had been no injuries, reported this news agency. The nuclear sub, itself, was partially submerged to minimize damage. The fire continued into Friday despite initial reports it had been extinguished, Itar-Tass reported. By 1:40 a.m., (4:40 p.m. ET Thursday), the blaze had been "localized," Russian Emergency Minister Sergei Shoigu said. One of seven Delta-IV class submarines in operation, the Yekaterinburg carries 16 ballistic missiles. According to the military research website RusNavy.com, the vessel was launched in September 1984, has two nuclear reactors and can carry a 140-person crew.	1
Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon's performance as an upset wife earned her a trip to jail and a disorderly conduct charge. "You are going to be on national news," Witherspoon allegedly told a Georgia state trooper as he handcuffed her on Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday morning. That didn't discourage Trooper First Class J. Pyland from writing a very quotable arrest report suitable for national news -- with dialogue worthy of a Witherspoon movie script. Her lawyer worked out a deal with the prosecutor Monday morning in which Witherspoon will go through a pre-trial intervention program to avoid getting a conviction on her record, an Atlanta Municipal Court spokesman said. The program provides "alternative methods of resolving criminal matters other than prosecution," the court's website said.  "Participants are charged with minor criminal offenses, do not have prior convictions, do not have any cases pending, and have not already gone through a diversion program."  The judge set May 22 as the date for a hearing to check if she is complying with the program. While the court's program may be relatively painless, Witherspoon is suffering from another punishment:  public humiliation. The actress canceled plans to do interviews in New York to promote her new film "Mud" on Monday, her publicist said.  She did walk the red carpet at the movie's New York premiere Sunday night, but she declined to talk to the media. Witherspoon, who was in Atlanta working on a movie titled "The Good Lie," was charged with interfering with Pyland's arrest of her husband, Hollywood agent James Toth, on a drunken driving charge. "Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote.  "I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet." Witherspoon, 37, allegedly did not follow his order, getting out of the Ford Fusion instead.  When the trooper warned her again, Witherspoon allegedly told him she was a U.S. citizen and allowed to "stand on American ground."  Her American pride got her handcuffed.	1
Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday. The Human Rights Watch report also documents "serious abuses" in Gaza's criminal justice system, such as arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions and unfair trials in the Palestinian territory of Gaza since the Hamas political movement took control in 2007. "After five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights, and grants impunity to abusive security services," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for Human Rights Watch, said in an online posting Wednesday. "Hamas should stop the kinds of abuses that Egyptians, Syrians, and others in the region have risked their lives to bring to an end." Read more: Opinion: Hamas at a crossroads In a bullet-point statement on its website, Hamas' Interior Ministry disputed the report's accuracy and called it biased and political. Titled "Abusive System: Criminal Justice in Gaza," the 43-page report said "there is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights." The group said Hamas has executed at least three men "convicted on the basis of 'confessions' apparently obtained under torture." Human Rights Watch says the rivalry between the Palestinian movements of Hamas and of Fatah, which prevails in the West Bank, "remains a significant factor" behind many of the alleged Hamas detainee abuses The group said the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority "arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse." Read more: Can rival Palestinian factions reach unity deal? Human Rights Watch's findings are also consistent with increasing reports of abuse by security forces in Gaza against detainees accused of nonpolitical crimes, including people accused of drug offenses and fraud. Some of the cases documented have been "against people detained on suspicion of collaborating with Israel or the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Collaboration is a serious crime under Palestinian law, but suspicion of collaboration does not justify torture or other abuse." Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said. His family and lawyer said he was tortured. But the group said military courts didn't "adequately address Shrair's claims of torture."	1
Jury selection kicked off Thursday in the federal corruption case of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his associates, who are accused of setting up a criminal enterprise in the vernacular of the time.Jury selection began with a question for the panel: “Do you believe that you can come to a verdict based on the evidence in the case, and that you can reach a verdict that’s not inconsistent with your own values as a citizen?"Judge Nancy Edmunds, the presiding judge in the case, put the question to the jurors as the trial was being broadcast live on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC.The jurors were allowed to listen to the opening statements, the testimony of prosecutors and defense witnesses, and then return to the courtroom without interruption.Juror No. 14, who was first through the door, told Edmunds, who was presiding over the trial in U.S. District Court in Detroit, that she was “comfortable” with her decision.“I’m not going to say I didn’t think about it, but I came right out of the gate," she said.She told Edmunds she "honestly" had not reached a final decision on which way she would vote."If I have to stand this trial over the course of four months, I don’t know," she said.Asked if she had reached a decision on which way to vote, she said, "Yes, I have. I honestly made up my mind already."The next juror to enter the room was Juror No. 5, an independent. She told Edmunds she hadn't reached a decision on whether or not to convict Kilpatrick, but that she was leaning in Kilpatrick's favor."I’m leaning towards the mayor, personally," she said. "I’m leaning toward the mayor."When Edmunds asked her whether she was leaning in Kilpatrick's favor, she said, "Yes, I am," and that she would not vote to convict the mayor.Edmunds told the jurors the same story as No. 5, and that after asking if they have reached a decision on which way to vote, she told them that she believed they could be fair to both sides if they kept their decisions secret so Kilpatrick and his lawyers could not benefit	0
A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in the murder of two British men, found shot dead at 3 a.m. Saturday in Sarasota, Florida, police say. Sarasota Police have identified the victims as James M. Cooper, 25, and James Thomas Kouzaris, 24, both from England. The juvenile, who police said was arrested previously this month on a charge of aggravated assault with a handgun, was arrested 24 hours after the murders at 3 a.m. Sunday. Where he was arrested was not disclosed. Police were alerted to the incident by a 911 caller who said "a person was lying on the ground covered in blood" at the scene, on a one-way residential street with no businesses. Sarasota Police Chief Mikel Hollaway said officials are trying to determine why the men were there. "We have our suspicions, but at this time it would be unfair to state those," he said. "I believe they were there of their own volition." The neighborhood where the British men were found is a housing project in north Sarasota called Newtown, Hollaway said. The teen suspect in the case lives near the crime scene, police said. Although the housing authority has worked to improve the complex, "it has its problems," Hollaway said. "This is an isolated incident." The murders were the first homicides of the year, he said. The two men were believed to be friends who recently graduated from college and were in Sarasota to celebrate, police said. "On behalf of the city of Sarasota, we want to express our condolences for the families of the two victims who were obviously on holiday from the United Kingdom," Sarasota Mayor Kelly Kirschner said.	1

O'Brien, who is a Hillary Clinton supporter, accused Stelter of not being honest with his viewers, saying:"You have no evidence that we're going to be in trouble with New York," Trump on Friday said. "What is it? What is the evidence you have that we're going to be sued by the city of New York? And how much do you know?"In response, Stelter said:"Look, Donald Trump has been in the news recently for a lot of things. He was in the news to talk about his tax returns, and then he was in the news as a businessman, talking about his businesses in New York, New Jersey, in the middle of March."Well, it's true that in a recent interview with New York magazine, Trump said:"I have no idea," he told New York magazine. "I may have some very good friends that are in jail. They may have been. I don't know. But you go and look at the newspapers. You look at the television and look at the people. You're going to understand, because you see that everybody is against me."O'Brien's statement is misleading. As she told MSNBC's Ed Schultz:"Listen, the idea that Donald Trump	0
I recently met a woman, the mother of three black teenagers. She told me that after the Trayvon Martin shooting, she forbade her boys to wear hoodies. She warned them never to walk around with their hands in their pockets. She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed. This is one hell of a thing to be afraid of. I don't think parents of white kids ever really feel this terror -- not in this way. I defended the man who shot Trayvon Martin, and I believe that the verdict the jury returned was correct and just. But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation. The shooting of Michael Brown -- an unarmed 18-year-old African-American in Ferguson, Missouri -- reinforces her fears, and it gives me a dull, empty feeling in my gut. We're hearing conflicting stories about how the Brown shooting happened. Some witnesses say the teenager had his hands up in surrender when an officer opened fire on him. The Ferguson police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser, and the first shot was fired inside the car. It's possible both accounts are true, but we don't know. Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him. Soon we should know how many times the officer shot Brown, from how far and from what direction. These factors will be critically important in determining whether the shooting was justified or not. Black or white, an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force, just like the rest of us. What we know about Michael Brown's shooting If Brown was shot from far away, or if he was shot in the back, it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified. What we must acknowledge is that we don't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other.	1
Hasbro announced plans Monday to unveil a black and silver Easy-Bake Oven after meeting with the New Jersey teen who started a campaign asking the toy maker to offer the product in gender-neutral packaging. McKenna Pope's Change.org  effort prompted the company to make the announcement."I am grateful to both Mike and Jen for giving me the opportunity to express my frustration, sadness, anger, and hurt over the way this company has handled Gender-Nonconforming kids by giving them the products they should have been getting all along," Pope told The Huffington Post . "It is my hope that this movement can gain more traction and help change these companies’ actions.""We recognize the power of the Internet.  We want to be clear the change we are requesting from the company and as a company is not a social movement which we would actively participate in. It’s not really up to us to decide if something is appropriate, but we certainly welcome the opportunity to offer input to our consumers and fans."After Pope, who is the daughter of the pop star Usher, submitted a Change.org  petition on June 8 asking her father to change the packaging on the Easy-Bake Oven, the toy giant responded on Monday. The company announced it will take action on its own and make the oven available in either purple  or pink packaging (depending on how it is packaged with other products) by Dec. 31.“For the Easy Bake Oven, our goal remains to provide as many options as possible for gender-nonconforming fans and consumers to celebrate their expression,” the toy giant said."In recent months, we’ve been taking a hard look at how we can better serve the entire family, to empower our partners and retailers, and help our families and consumers make their own authentic choices for who they love and how they bring their family together.""The changes we are making today will have a bigger effect than any other Easy Bake Oven decision we’ve made before. As a new parent, I can testify that when the Easy Bake Oven was introduced in 2011, my son was excited about it when his grandma gave him one as a gift," Pope added."I had just turned seven years old when the Easy Bake Oven was introduced. The toy made me feel beautiful and powerful. When he received the Easy Bake Oven,	0
Three aid groups called Thursday for an immediate halt to any new adoptions of Haitian children after last week's earthquake. Save the Children, World Vision and a unit of the British Red Cross said the focus first must be on tracing any family members  who have been displaced or left homeless, before the focus quickly shifts to finding housing for the children.'We want to hear about any families who have been displaced or left homeless,'" said Sara Miller, spokeswoman for World Vision International Inc. "If there is no other family there, then we want to find a family member who is willing to adopt the orphaned children in Haiti.""It is heartbreaking to watch our children disappear without knowing what happened to them," said Barbara Jones, CEO of the British Red Cross. "The tragedy that this is happening in such a remote part of the country must be addressed immediately and urgently. Families need to know we are here and will stand strong for them and their children."The Red Cross said it will begin a "rapid" search for families with children who have already been or may have been affected by the earthquake. The group said it is contacting potential adoptive families as soon as it can."The search process for potential adoptive families has begun and we will be reaching out to all who may have been affected and are living in the affected zones," said Mark Walker, chief communications officer for the British Red Cross, in a statement.About 40 children were orphaned or otherwise left homeless in Haiti after the April 17 earthquake but, according to Save the Children, most children have been located. Save the Children provided food, clothing, shoes, and other basic needs for nearly 600 children last week as they were taken to temporary shelters after the earthquake.But it is still difficult for the children to accept the fact that they need new homes.Save the Children said that a child once described her experience being taken from her family as "the worst experience of her life.""A lot of the children need our help even more than what was given to them," said Mary Pate, executive director of Save the Children. "When we started this we started with 60 children and we're now at about 300 and we need to get more. We need to get more children into the right homes."A lot of the children need our help even more than what was given to them Mary Pate, Save the ChildrenThe group called	0
The work in Washington state communities shattered by a landslide in late March has turned its focus from searching for missing bodies to a rebuilding operation, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department said Monday. Forty-one people have been confirmed dead and identified. Two people remain missing, but "essentially the active search has ended," Shari Ireton told CNN. A rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the rural town of Oso on March 22. Search crews had been digging through deep mud and debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing. "We are looking at recovery and rebuilding," Ireton said, referring to clearing and repairing roads damaged or covered by the slide. Steven Hadaway and Kris Regelbrugge were never found. Frank Hadaway told CNN affiliate KCPQ that he has peace even though his brother's body may never be found. One resident, who found his sister's body in her car two weeks ago, said the search needs to continue. "There's a lot of people that want to keep going," Dayn Brunner told KCPQ. "And there's a lot of people that will even do it for free. We just want everybody out." The search is not entirely over as some workers "will still be monitoring for possible victim's remains," Ireton said.	1
Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from Taliban captivity was largely celebrated at first. In the ensuing days, however, several serious issues about death, honor and the law have arisen, and those issues continue to grow. Is Bergdahl in military trouble? Any legal issues about Bergdahl, who's been accused of desertion, will be addressed once he has returned to U.S. soil. He's now being treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. A senior U.S. defense official said this week that Bergdahl has not been classified a deserter and is still scheduled to be promoted to the rank of staff sergeant later this month. "We have not classified him as a deserter. At this point we do not have any understanding of why he left his camp that night" in June 2009, the official said. Military officials need to hear Bergdahl's explanation of those events, the official said. He noted that the Army promoted Bergdahl in rank during his captivity. One expert, Geoffrey Corn, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said the accusations raise "some very serious violations of the uniform code of military justice and arguably violations that led to the loss of life of members of his own unit in their efforts to recover him." "There's going to be a very deliberate and careful effort to develop the facts, although that also raises complicating issues related to whether or not he is entitled to a Miranda-type warning under the military code, which might lead him to say he doesn't want to talk about it at all," Corn said. Corn spent 22 years in the Army as an officer and civilian employee, with his last post as the Army's senior law of war expert in the office of the judge advocate general. Were U.S. soldiers killed searching for Bergdahl? There is controversy over whether soldiers were killed, directly or indirectly, in the search for Bergdahl after he was taken captive by the Taliban. Former soldiers involved in the operations to find Bergdahl asserted to CNN this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for Bergdahl in 2009. They provided the soldiers' names and their dates of death, with circumstances for some of them.	1
Say hello to the new Captain. In the first issue of Marvel's "All-New Captain America," in stores today, onetime sidekick Sam Wilson sheds his Falcon persona and picks up the Captain's patriotic shield. Sam iz a secret agent-for-hire working for the world's most notorious criminal—a one-man-squad known as Hydra. The character will serve as a major foil for Captain America and help define the new direction of the Marvel Universe.MarvelMarvel Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso talks with the press about the new Captain — who comes clean about who he really is, and the real reason he wants to fight crime.Alonso: "Captain America is a very important character because he’s the guy that started the character out. And, he’s also very personal. And that is something that Marvel takes very seriously.We really want to tell the real Captain America story, and make it really clear: he’s a hero, not a villain. In the past, we’ve given him things that, we think, he’s not interested in. We gave him a new costume. This is a new costume. We gave him a new identity. This is a new identity. We gave him new friends. This is a new friend, from the old days. This is a new friend from his new past, from when he’s now had an identity that he’s taken on."A new past: A new past. And this new past. This new Captain America could be the answer to all our problems.MarvelAnd the real truth is: they don't know. We don't know. The real truth is: they don't know.MarvelAll of these stories are coming in the first issue. That's why he hasn't told his secret identity yet, because he wants to take his time with this story. We'll be hearing the truth of who he is, and the truth of why he wants to fight crime.MarvelAlonso: "Our goal is to tell these stories. I mean, it’s like if you had people who went to Washington, DC, you would want to make sure that the stories they told, they were all true, or that they were just really telling the truth, so they're not doing what the establishment was	0
Elliot Rodger's difficulties with women were so devastating to him that he vowed to kill anyone he couldn't win over. "My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I cannot have," Rodger wrote in a 137-page manifesto obtained by CNN affiliate KEYT. "All of those beautiful girls I've desired so much in my life, but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy." He also said he despised men who had luck with women and said he would eliminate them, too. "I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer," he added. "It is only fair." On Friday, that "day of retribution" came. Authorities say Rodger, 22, fatally stabbed three men in his home before killing two women outside a sorority house and then shooting a man at a deli in Isla Vista, California. By the end of his rampage, six victims were dead. Rodger died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. And perhaps the only clues to the reasons are in the gunman's haunting dissertation of his life. A life-changing divorce For most of his early childhood, Rodger was a happy boy. But he said his first major traumatic event came when he learned at 7 that his parents were divorcing. He described his parents' divorce as a devastating, "life-changing event," but said he gained more respect for his father after he quickly acquired a girlfriend. "Males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men, even children," Rodger wrote. "How ironic is it that my father, one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend, has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend." Bitterness after puberty But the impetus for most of Rodger's angst stemmed from his unfulfilled desires for women. "As children we all play together as equals in a fair environment. Only after the advent of puberty does the true brutality of human nature show its face," he wrote. "Life will become a bitter and unfair struggle for self-worth, all because girls will choose some boys over others. The boys who girls find attractive will live pleasure-filled lives while they dominate the boys who girls deem unworthy." He described himself as a very jealous person, "and at the age of nine my jealous nature sprung to the surface."	1
A 23-year-old exchange student, attacked in her Toronto apartment while a friend in China watched via computer webcam, was found dead there hours later, police say. Toronto Police on Monday identified the student as Qian (Necole) 不冰, who was on sabbatical from the University of Toronto's School of Public Policy and Governance when she died Saturday night. The family told police she took her life with a hammer, and police are not ruling out a suicide theory. They say Qian's body was found at about 4:30am in a "distressed and dilapidated" apartment in Scarborough's Junction Triangle, a densely populated area that has seen a recent run on home improvements. It is believed she went to bed around 9:30pm the prior evening after a night out with friends, and was found dead when she failed to show up for work Sunday morning. The victim's father said his daughter had moved to Scarborough from Hong Kong not long ago but was making friends in the city and was "always happy, friendly and friendly with everyone," the Canadian Press reports. The family has hired a lawyer in a last effort to find out what happened before her body was found. Police say Qian did not tell them much. The family told police their daughter was living with a man named Peter, who was her "main roommate", but police did not know his whereabouts. While police were in touch with him Wednesday, he "denied involvement in his daughter's death", police said. Her parents were also not told about Peter until later, police said, citing privacy concerns, and "at the point they were informed, they became extremely distressed and emotionally distraught". Neighbours told CBC News that Qian and Peter shared a room in June, and that both appeared well-liked. When asked if she had any particular reason why she would want to kill herself or why she would go to a new neighbourhood, she didn't respond, neighbors told CBC News. Qian had been living in Scarborough for almost two years, though she had travelled to London, Ontario, more than four times in the past two years. (Qian's mother was not at home to answer questions about the case, and her phone was not reachable.) The area is home to many of Toronto's homeless, many of whom have been the victims of crime as well as the subjects of police raids. Neighbors said her apartment had seen numerous repairs during previous months. "I think it is	0
The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin. "Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight, something to that effect," Robert Zimmerman told Orlando news station WOFL. "He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did." In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting that has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Obama to call it a tragedy and prompted a federal investigation. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. "He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken," Robert Zimmerman said. "He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete." Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation. The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts. A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video did not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face. "The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all," said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. "He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in anyway shape or form, someone's whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone who's nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal." Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly.	1
A perilous face-off intensified Saturday when Russia state news complained that Ukraine had mobilized 15,000 troops in the suburbs of Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine "in order to wipe out the city and its residents." Quoting a Russian Defense  Ministry order, the Russian media said Ukraine had sent a force of about 2,200 fighters to the area.After the Russian order was leaked by another Russian TV station, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying: "Ukraine has nothing to do with the formation of this group in Slavyansk and there is no need to mobilise troops there. Ukraine has not started an operation against Russian-occupied territory."However, Ukraine's Defense Ministry told reporters that its troops were mobilized "in order to prevent the enemy from using Slavyansk as a launch-pad for further attacks." It said they were gathering in the region to "defend the people of southeastern Ukraine, especially citizens trying to protect their city."Ukraine's Defense Ministry said it is planning to use Russian border defenses to protect the government's forces in Slavyansk.In Moscow, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's spokesman, Valerii Kondik, said that according to his information, the Russian troops were only "provincial troops." He said that Russian border guards "are located in Russia.""In fact, they have always been stationed in Crimea, not near the borders of the territory of the Ukrainian republic of Crimea and Sevastopol," Kondik said. He also said the troops were at the center of Ukraine's efforts to protect Slavyansk.Ukraine is in the middle of a showdown with Russia after its military captured Slovyansk, the main city in the Donetsk People's Republic in April. But Russian forces have been present in various locations around the republic since it was declared by Moscow in July 2014. The Russian government says the republic's government is a "federation of bandits" using the language of "banditry and bandit tactics" while Ukraine denies that.Saturday's developments came as Russian President Vladimir Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Sochi, where he again condemned Ukraine's seizure of Slovyansk. Merkel said Russia's actions were in violation of international law."We are all concerned with Ukraine. Russia has made massive attempts to destabilize Ukraine," she said, adding that she and Putin had discussed Ukraine, Syria and a range of other security issues.In	0
A father and mother showed heroism when a gunman opened fired inside their California home before dawn Saturday, but two members of the family couldn't overcome their wounds, Inglewood police said. The mother ran from the house carrying her youngest child, though she was shot in both legs, in an "extraordinary rescue attempt," police said. The 4-year-old boy, however, was shot in the head and later died in surgery. The mother was in critical but stable condition Saturday afternoon. Inside the house, the father used his body as a shield in trying to protect the other three children. Despite the father's efforts, the gunfire wounded two of his children: a 6-year-old boy in the pelvis and a 7-year-old girl in the chest. Both were in critical but stable condition, police said. The father later died in surgery of multiple gunshot wounds. The oldest of four children, an 8-year-old boy, was the sole family member who wasn't injured, police said. "What would motivate an individual to do this is inexplicable," Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said. Inglewood is adjacent to Los Angeles and its international airport. Police were conducting a manhunt for the suspect, who lived in a house in the rear of the property. That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said. Police did not release names of the father, 30; mother, 28; or their children as of Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Saturday when police received a report of 10 gunshots at the property. The fire department also received a call at the same time. Firefighters were hampered by fears that the gunman might have been armed in the rear residence, police said. Fallen power lines also hindered firefighting efforts. The suspect was described as a 55-year-old black man with a dark baseball cap and is 5-foot-6 and 160 pounds, police said. They later identified him as Desmond John Moses. The suspect wore a painter's mask when he gunned down the family, the police chief said. Police didn't provide a motive. The suspect should be considered armed and dangerous, the police chief said.

President Obama declared Monday that his stimulus plan is "starting to work" and that 2,000 transportation projects -- costing much less than expected -- are under way. President Obama on Monday says the transportation projects will help unleash the nation's economic growth.But that could spell certain doom for the controversial public-private partnership known as the high-speed rail boondoggle. Now Republicans -- including the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman, John Mica (R-Fla.) -- have pledged to use the Federal Railroad Administration to cancel the high-speed rail program as soon as possible."The Obama administration is ignoring the American people's clamor for better public transportation," Mica said. "The Obama administration is asking state and local officials to build these projects in the face of stiff and continued opposition. This will have disastrous and detrimental effects on the economy."The FRA is expected to propose new rules this month that will require federal approval for all high-speed rail project applications.This is a major development, as the FRA is normally a neutral and independent agency. FRA has been an active supporter of the high speed rail program, and the agency's president, Christopher H. Madsen, was in support of the President's Recovery Act.But in this case, the president has promised action by August 16. "This administration and Congress are committed to getting our economy back on track," he said last month. "But we cannot do it alone. The country has got to get back to work. This is going to be hard. It will be expensive. But we can't have a country where Washington is dictating how we run our lives."This promise of action -- made on August 16, 2009 -- was made for a reason. Congress had passed the stimulus package on June 27, 2009. This stimulus package will cost taxpayers $8.975 trillion over the next 10 years, and it had been estimated that it would cost $1.4 trillion in new expenses over the five years after its passage to offset the costs. President Obama also had estimated the cost of the stimulus in April 2009, but he never actually gave a cost estimate.This fact, combined with President Obama's promise of action, has raised concerns that the President isn't really serious about the high speed rail boondoggle.The real question is whether President Obama will stick his neck out and take on the Republicans and actually	0
The former judge who last year lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a dry cleaners over a missing pair of pants wants his job back. Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $54 million over a missing pair of pants. Roy Pearson was not reappointed after his term expired as an administrative law judge in the District of Columbia. He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an "unlawful demotion and subsequent termination." Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007, during his unsuccessful $54 million lawsuit against a dry cleaning business, which he accused of failing to meet its promise of "satisfaction guaranteed." As an administrative law judge, Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes. A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review. A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct "on and off the bench." The source, who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson's review, said "a judge is a judge 24/7; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider." The civil case, in which Pearson represented himself, sought punitive and compensatory damages against a small family-owned dry cleaners that once posted signs promising "satisfaction guaranteed." A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer. The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson, who denied under oath that they were his. The judge found in favor of the dry cleaners and disagreed with Pearson that the satisfaction promise was unconditional. Pearson petitioned the trial judge for a reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed an appeal with the D.C. Court of Appeals, which will hear his appeal later this year. In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington, Pearson, again acting as his own attorney, relies on what he considers Washington's "Whistleblower Protection" law to try to establish illegal retaliation. The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates, who accused Pearson of abusing the system. The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction.	1
The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship. The loss didn't go over well with icky Bruins fans after they lost in a seven-game Stanley Cup Final to the Detroit Red Wings in 1997. However, the current Bruins are doing just fine, and they'll get a second chance to win back-to-back Stanley Cups.The current Bruins are on a roll, going 4-0-1 in their last five games. The five wins came after Boston dropped a 4-0 decision to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night, a game that was very interesting due to the fact that the Penguins lost their top center, Sidney Crosby, for the season with a knee injury and now are reeling after losing two key defensemen, Marc Savard and Kris Letang, to season-ending injuries.The Bruins are on the road now, facing the first of three first-place teams they'll face in the upcoming month. With the first place team being the Boston Globe's choice for the NHL's most improved team, the Tampa Bay Lightning, who are 4-2-1, Boston has a great chance to win it all and become the first non-#1 seed to win the Stanley Cup since 1970.Boston will play their first two games of the playoffs at Tampa Bay on Thursday night, and in a four-game series ending on Saturday, the Bruins will host the St. Louis Blues.For the Bruins, it's about the playoffs, so they'll be playing a lot of hockey in October and November. They'll have to find ways to get their offense involved and score before they can focus on the playoffs. For now, it's about playing in front of home fans and getting a championship in the first year under Bruce Cassidy.There's no better way to start a season than knocking off the defending Stanley Cup winners from Boston. The Bruins will continue playing the way that they played in the Finals against the Wings. The Bruins will be ready to play in October and November after an offseason in which they lost the NHL's top players.The Bruins will have to play at their top-three offense, top-three defensive pairings to beat the Lightning. I believe the Bruins are the top team in the Eastern Conference, and if they get off to a good start, then they can	0
The Japanese government has criticized former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's acknowledgment of a "territorial dispute" with China over islands in the East China Sea, with the defense minister going so far as to use the word "traitor." On his four-day private visit to China, Hatoyama told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday, "The Japanese government says there are no territorial disputes (between the two countries). But if you look at history, there is a dispute." The remarks contradict his own government's position of indisputable territorial sovereignty over the islands that it calls Senkaku and that China calls Diaoyu. "If his (Hatoyama's) remarks have been politically used by China, I'm unhappy," Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said on television Thursday. "At that moment, the word of 'traitor' arose in my mind." Dangerous waters: Behind the islands dispute The day after his controversial remarks, Hatoyama, 66, and his wife visited the Nanjing Memorial, which is for the estimated 300,000 people killed in a 1937 massacre by Japanese forces. He is the third former Japanese prime minister to visit the memorial, following predecessors Toshiki Kaifu and Tomiichi Murayama. The tribute for Chinese victims stands in contrast to visits by Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and predecessor Junichiro Koizumi, to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead, including war criminals. "In the eyes of the Chinese public, (Hatoyama's) visit is very valuable and undermines those in China who argue that all Japanese suffer from amnesia about wartime misdeeds," said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. "I think this mission is an effort by him to introduce a different tenor into bilateral relations, to show it's not all about saber-rattling," he added. Chinese media extensively covered Hatoyama's "apology for Japan's wartime crimes," with pictures of the Hatoyamas bowing and paying silent tribute at the site. On social media, the visit triggered wide discussions. According to an online poll by Phoenix Online (iFeng), 80% of the more than 222,000 people who voted said Hatoyama's visit did not have much political significance, as compared with German Chancellor Willy Brandt's kneeling before the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial in 1970.	1
The National Hockey League and a sports-oriented anti-homophobia advocacy group announced Thursday they are joining forces to provide players with tolerance training and other programs. The league said the agreement with You Can Play cements pro hockey's reputation as the world's most inclusive sports league. The New York-based league will partner with You Can Play to provide formal anti-homophobia training for all incoming players. The team and the players' union will also work to build You Can Play's programs into the league's behavioral health program to give players a confidential outlet to discuss issues of sexual orientation, according to a statement issued by the You Can Play and the league It also calls for a "significant commitment" to training for teams, players and the public through formal training programs and outreach efforts -- including public service announcements featuring NHL players. "As NHL players, we all strive to contribute towards helping our teams achieve success on the ice. Any player who can help in those efforts should be welcomed as a teammate," the statement quoted Ron Hainsey, a Winnipeg Jets defenseman and member of the NHL Players Association board, as saying. Opinion: An openly gay player is not a distraction "This partnership solidifies the message that the hockey community believes in fairness and equality for everyone," he said. The move doesn't affect the NHL's policy on discrimination based on sexual orientation, which has been part of its contract with players since 2005. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the agreement makes the NHL's policy of inclusiveness "clear and unequivocal." "While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community, we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture with the NHL Players' Association that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands," Bettman said in the joint statement with You Can Play. Other leagues also have promoted tolerance. The NBA's contract with players says the league can't discriminate against gay players, and new players receive tolerance training. The league has partnered with the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and the Ad Council on an ad campaign addressing homophobic language and has worked with the gay rights advocacy group GLAAD on initiatives to address anti-gay bullying and other issues.	1
A bizarre three-and-a-half minute North Korean propaganda video -- depicting a city resembling New York but with its skyscrapers on fire -- was pulled from YouTube this week after videogame maker Activision said those scenes were lifted from its top-selling game "Call of Duty." Clicking on the now-defunct YouTube link brings up the message: "This video has been removed by the user. Sorry about that." But the video can still be found elsewhere on the internet. The anti-U.S. video also employs an instrumental version of "We Are the World," written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, while a sleeping North Korean man apparently dreams himself aboard a North Korean space shuttle launched into orbit around the Earth. Just after the video's two-minute mark, a city covered by a large American flag is seen apparently being bombarded by a missile attack. The Korean-language caption that scrolls across the screen says, "Black smoke was billowing somewhere in America. Maybe the group of Satan, who has been habitually conducting an invasion war, are burning in the fire they set themselves." The release of this video, the latest in a series of regular propaganda videos, comes as experts and officials widely believe North Korea is on the verge of its third nuclear test, following trials in 2006 and 2009. The country's use of copyrighted material is not new. In 2012, Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and a cast of Disney characters appeared at a Pyongyang theater for newly-ascended North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Walt Disney Company denounced the use of its characters and said in a statement, "This was not licensed or authorized by The Walt Disney Company," according to the Associated Press.	1
Hot, dry weather returns to Texas this week, whisking away the limited relief scattered thunderstorms brought to firefighters in parts of the Lone Star state over the weekend. In a trifecta of potentially bad news for Ã¢ÂÂdrought-strickenÃ¢ÂÂ central Texas, the National Weather Service reports that a nor'easter packing gusty winds is heading this way on Sunday.And itÃ¢ÂÂs not just the weather. Officials in El Paso on Friday reported two homes had been damaged by the raging winds, the weather service reported.The wind is expected to drop to 30 to 40 miles per hour during the day on Sunday, but the rain and storms could stay on the ground through the day. And the forecast isnÃ¢ÂÂt getting any better out of the forecast office.On Thursday, a severe weather warning was issued for the storm, and the National Weather Service is calling for heavy rain with high winds through Saturday morning. Rainfall accumulations are expected anywhere from 2 to 4 inches. Rain is predicted to begin sometime around 9 a.m. for areas where the rain is heaviest. Temperatures will drop to the lower 80s in central and south Texas, but could be in the low 90s across rural areas of the north. This storm is going to bring high winds and an extremely dangerous coastal storm surge.In the morning hours of Sunday, severe thunderstorms will move into the areas from Texas to the Gulf of Mexico. The areas north of Corpus Christi will experience the worst of the impacts, where hail, lightning and damaging winds will be the main threats.The NWS has issued a flash flood watch for the region this weekend, especially for areas from Corpus Christi to the border with Mexico.The storm also has the potential to bring "life threatening" amounts of precipitation to the western half of the state.The storm started up Friday, with scattered showers, but nothing out of the ordinary. Then things really got crazy this past weekend, with flooding, wind, extreme thunderstorms and a nor'easter taking out a truck trailer loaded with oranges.In Corpus Christi, heavy rain fell on Friday, with some locations receiving more than 2 inches of rain.The next day, the high winds shifted to the southeast, bringing rain with it	0
Standard Chartered has agreed to pay a $340 million fine to New York banking regulators to settle charges it laundered money for Iranian clients -- but the UK bank is far from the only one to be implicated in illegal transactions with sanctioned nations. Since 2009, several major international financial institutions have been charged with conspiring to violate U.S. economic sanctions against doing business with Iran and other countries. These banks purportedly facilitated the movement of billions of dollars through the U.S. financial system by falsifying tens of thousands of outgoing U.S. dollar (USD) payment messages for Iran and other countries subject to economic sanctions such as Sudan, Libya, and Cuba. The violations involved the practice of "stripping" identifier information from wire transfer documentation to conceal that the transactions were on behalf of Iranian clients or those from other rogue countries. More: StanChart pays $340 million to settle charges The violations of sanctions against Iran and other countries were not an accident. Instead, senior bank officials knowingly and willfully sought to circumvent U.S. anti-money laundering controls. Further, bank officials engaged in repeated violations of U.S. sanctions, stripping the identifier information from tens of thousands of Iranian transactions valued in the billions. The criminal schemes were allegedly perpetrated over an extended period of time, in some cases spanning 10 years or more. In each case bank employees permitted Iranian USD payments to be cleared through U.S. banks without regard to the ultimate destination of the funds and whether they were intended to finance Iran's nuclear missile program or support Hezbollah or other terrorist groups. Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) has agreed to pay the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) $340 million to settle charges that the British bank concealed over $250 billion in transactions with Iranian clients and deliberately lied to New York banking regulators. But SCB is not an isolated case. In 2009, Lloyds Bank and Credit Suisse were fined $350 million and $536 million, respectively, for allegedly removing or altering information to conceal prohibited transactions with Iranian clients and customers from other sanctioned countries. In 2010, ABN Amro and Barclays were docked $500 million and $298 million, respectively, for allegedly committing similar crimes.

A most awkward and revealing situation has emerged in the heart of Europe, forcing European governments to choose between their principles and their fears, and drawing an uncomfortable gap between Europe's words and its actions. Last July, a bus carrying tourists  — including children — collided with a car, killing two people. In a country, the Netherlands, where the deaths have been widely studied, there are a growing number of citizens who think the accident was caused by driver error. In a nation like the Netherlands, this should not be a surprise. In the country's public transportation system, drivers are supposed to be trained to detect hazards such as roadworks or speed bumps; they are told that their actions are monitored by cameras and they are tested every six months on how well they know the rules of the road. Yet, in the days after the accident, the Dutch government was forced to take up the cause of blaming the driver of the car.The cause of the accident was a defect in the bus. Two of the eight passengers on board the bus had taken a sip from a bottle of water earlier in the day that was sitting, not on the floor of the bus, on a shelf above the seat.The official report described how the accident happened. The bus driver, a man with a long history of accidents, ran out of signals. He looked down at his radar screen and did not see the bus coming and thought that it was driving too fast. He then looked up at his GPS screen, which showed that the bus was driving in an area with no speed limit. Because it was a clear day, there was no traffic lights showing green at the intersection where the accident had occurred. He thought that the bus must have been driving in the wrong lane. He did not check his mirrors or realize that the bus was stopping at the traffic lights. He did not realize that the bus was stopping because it was on a loop.At the time of the accident, the bus driver was still an employee of the municipality of The Hague. He had never been in this situation before. The man who drove the bus, a man with a long and distinguished career as a journalist, a professor, a writer and a politician, was himself driving a car with an outstanding record of public service and a well-known character. He was known to the public. So this is what he did next: He left the bus, came to the crash scene and stood in front of his car,	0
North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and more ballistic missile tests if the U.N. Security Council doesn't withdraw its condemnation of Pyongyang's rocket launch earlier this month, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. A photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency showing the recent rocket launch. The U.N. Security Council "should promptly make an apology for having infringed the sovereignty of [North Korea] and withdraw all its unreasonable and discriminative 'resolutions' and decisions adopted against [North Korea]," a spokesman for the North's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "The measures will include nuclear tests and test-firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles," the unidentified spokesman said. The statement also said Pyongyang will start building a light-water nuclear power plant and begin production of nuclear fuel. The Security Council condemned the April 5 rocket launch as a violation of a 2006 resolution that bans North Korea's ballistic missile activity. North Korea, angered by the Security Council's unanimous vote, has threatened to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons. It has said it will restore its disabled nuclear reactor. The six-party talks -- involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- have been aimed at persuading North Korea to scrap its nuclear program. North Korea has begun reprocessing fuel rods, its Foreign Ministry said Saturday, according to state-run media. "The reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the Foreign Ministry statement dated April 14," a ministry spokesman said. "This will contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defense in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces."	1
The alleged surviving attacker from last month's Mumbai terror attacks is seeking help from Pakistani officials, India said Monday. Guests arrive at the urn containing the ashes of late Pakistani terrorist Quarrab Quills, during his funeral prayers. Quarrab, who was killed during last month's attacks, was a trained militant and had joined Lashkar-e-Taiba.The man who allegedly carried out the massacre at the Batla House residential complex in Pune on Saturday, which left nine people dead and 48 others wounded, is seeking help from the Pakistani High Commission."Pranav Bhosale, a trained terrorist in Pakistan, is in need of help. He is seeking help from the Pakistan High Commission. He should have some documents to give to the Pakistani authorities," a spokesman for the Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Raj Kumar Pathak, said on Monday.Last month's attacks followed the murder of seven Indian soldiers, one Indian police officer and an exchange of bomb blasts in Mumbai, the nation's financial hub.In India, the man, who is believed to be in his late 20s, arrived in India on Saturday night, Indian government sources told The Telegraph.The Mumbai attack came two days after the Pakistan High Commission said two Lashkar operatives were killed in a clash along the India-Pakistan border.The two Pakistanis involved in the incident were killed in a gun battle with the anti-India Baluch guerrillas some 40 miles from the border.Pakistan's Foreign office said on Monday that these killings will not hinder efforts to resolve differences between the two nations through diplomatic channels."The killings in Pakistan do not affect the efforts or the progress made by Indian officials in this country," Foreign office spokesman Abdul Basit said in a statement.While announcing the death of Lashkar's second in-charge Javed Afridi, the Pakistan High Commissioner said the organisation's topmost commander, Hafiz Saeed, would take charge of Lashkar's operations in Pakistan.According to Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority's (NCTA) head, M Qureshi, Saeed could soon be brought under custody, "as soon as the legal process gets completed. "But, obviously, the government does have evidence to suggest he was involved in the Mumbai attacks and there may be a need to extradite him," he said.Mumbai attacks: 9 dead	0
Are technology companies ailing? Hewlett-Packard certainly is. The venerable behemoth announced it will implement a restructuring that includes eliminating 27,000 jobs. HP tried to bring itself around by replacing its CEO last year. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about doing the right thing,Ã¢â€ Scott Borgeson, HPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-executive chairman of the board, said in an interview. Ã¢â‚¬Â€ÂœThe hard part is actually executing.Ã¢â€HP is not alone in this situation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The industry has been slow to adapt to change,Ã¢â€ said Ron Cairns, executive chairman of the Information Technology Industry Council. Most of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big companies Ã¢â‚¬â€œfrom Microsoft to IBM to IntelÃ¢â‚¬â€ť have similar numbers of layoffs.For many companies, the layoffs are a sign of the health of their business lines. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think the most important thing is a healthy company and strong relationships with customers,Ã¢â€ said Scott Kriens, a former Ford executive who is now chief financial officer at Cisco Systems, Ã¢â‚¬â€œand a healthy company is one with a strong internal corporate culture and strong relationships with those customers.Ã¢â€HP is not necessarily a bad company. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In general, people are very loyal to their companies," Borgeson said.But there are other reasons for the layoffs. The market for personal computers and technology has been changing rapidly and rapidly. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think in the past it was very, very solid,Ã¢â€ said Andy King, president of Microsoft. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more dependent on the services we provide. The market has had to change very dramatically, and	0
New details emerged of what the White House knew about the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups, with spokesman Jay Carney disclosing Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was among the top officials made aware of the matter late last month. In a new timeline provided by Carney to reporters on Monday, General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned on April 24 of a pending Treasury inspector general's report on how IRS staff used criteria targeting conservative groups in assessing eligibility for tax-exempt status. According to Carney, Ruemmler told McDonough as well as other Treasury officials about the pending report. It was the first time the White House acknowledged that McDonough was aware of the report before it became public in early May. IRS: By the numbers In addition, Carney made clear that the information Ruemmler received on April 24 included details of improper acts by IRS officials. At the same time, Carney emphasized that the information was preliminary and could have changed before the inspector general released his final report on May 14. Carney insisted no one -- including Ruemmler and McDonough -- told President Barack Obama anything about the inspector general's pending report before media reports about it began appearing on May 10. "We knew the subject of the investigation and we knew the nature of some of the potential findings, but we did not have a copy of the draft report," Carney said. "We did not know the details, the scope, or the motivation surrounding the misconduct and we did not know who was responsible. Most importantly, the report was not final and still very much subject to change." Opinion: What happened to Obama's promise? However, the new information on Monday continued a perception of a White House on the defensive over the issue, one of at least three controversies dogging Obama as his second term reaches the four-month mark. The Senate Finance Committee will hold the second congressional hearing on the matter Tuesday, after the House Ways and Means Committee grilled the outgoing acting commissioner of the IRS last Friday. On Monday, the Senate panel's Democratic chairman and ranking Republican sent a letter to the IRS official, Steven Miller, seeking an exhaustive list of information about the case. Another hearing is set for Wednesday by a third panel -- the House Oversight Committee. Some Republicans are calling for a special investigation into the IRS matter, in which tax officers assessing applications for tax-exempt status used key words such as "tea party" in determining levels of scrutiny.	1
A woman who said she had a mother-daughter relationship with slain model Jasmine Fiore told CNN's Larry King on Thursday night that Fiore never informed her that she had been married. An arrest warrant has been issued for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, wanted in the death of ex-wife Jasmine Fiore. Gwendolyn Beauregard said Fiore was a close friend of her two sons, and she met the future model when Fiore was just 11. Despite the close ties -- "she called me mommy and she was my daughter" -- Beauregard was in the dark about Fiore's marriage to Ryan Jenkins. The marriage reportedly was annulled a few weeks after their Las Vegas, Nevada, wedding. An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. Authorities believe he's fled to Canada. Fiore's body was found Saturday, stuffed into a suitcase and left in a Dumpster in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim in Orange County, California. Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore. "She didn't tell me that she married him. She told me [about] the day that they met, which was St. Patrick's Day," Beauregard said. "She called me the day after and she said: 'Mommy, I met the most perfect guy in the world and -- and his name is Ryan.' And she just went on and on and on about Ryan and how perfect he was. And that was all I knew." Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins. Mike Fleeman, the West Coast editor of People.com, described more details of Fiore's whirlwind courtship with Jenkins to King. "They met in Las Vegas. Two days later [in March], they got married at the Little White Wedding Chapel. That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married," Fleeman told King. "It was a quickie wedding. We today talked to somebody who was at the wedding. One of the witnesses was an employee of the chapel. A lot of people were shocked that both of them were married. They kept it under wraps. And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning," Fleeman said.	1
who drove drunk and caused a crash, killing four people and injuring two -- go to a lock-down residential treatment facility. State District Judge Jean Boyd had already decided the Texas teenager would serve no jail time. He was sentenced last year to 10 years' probation. His story made national headlines after a witness claimed Couch was a victim of "affluenza" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the boy. That particular defense, however, played no part in the judge's decision, Couch's lawyer told reporters on Wednesday. Court proceedings were closed to the public. "She (Boyd) said it (affluenza), and specifically mentioned that that was not a basis for her decision," said attorney Reagan Wynn. "She heard all the evidence and she made what she thought was the appropriate disposition." 'Affluenza' defense psychologist: 'I wish I hadn't used that term' The judge ordered that Couch's parents pay for the treatment facility, which was not identified. It was also unclear how long Couch might stay  there. As part of his probation, the teen must refrain from using drugs or alcohol. He will also not be allowed to drive. If Couch violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years behind bars. "I think he can be rehabilitated given intensive therapy and I hope that he gets it," Wynn said about the teen. "The juvenile system is about rehabilitation and if it's going to be about rehabilitation, she (Boyd) absolutely made the right decision." Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter in the crash, disagrees. He told reporters he has no doubt that money played a role in the case. Steering teen drivers out of harm's way "Had he (Couch) not had money to have the defense there, to also have the experts testify, and also offer to pay for the treatment, I think the results would have been different," he said Wednesday after the proceedings. Last June, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction.	1
Federal authorities have charged a trendy Santa Monica sushi restaurant with serving whale meat -- an investigation that was spurred by the team behind the Oscar-winning documentary, "The Cove." Prosecutors charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of The Hump, and one of its chefs -- Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose. While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States. The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. Lawyers for Typhoon could not be reached for comment. But the restaurant told the Los Angeles Times it accepts responsibility and will pay a fine. The investigation began in October when two members of the team that made "The Cove" visited The Hump, officials said. "The Cove," which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary on Sunday. The restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for "a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced." Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as "whale" and "horse" with the cost -- $85 -- written next to them. The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said. The sei is found throughout the world's oceans. Whalers began to hunt them after the population of blue and in whales declined due to overfishing. It is now considered an endangered species. In February and March, the activists returned and again asked for -- and were served -- whale meat, the criminal complaint said. A DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale, Mrozek said.	1
Two lawsuits say the national chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity allowed a culture of "violent misogyny" after an internal email from the Georgia Tech chapter leaked last year instructing fraternity members on how to lure "rapebait." The lawsuits were filed Thursday in an Atlanta court on behalf of two anonymous women -- listed as Jane Doe and June Doe -- alleging they were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in 2012 and 2014 at the Georgia Tech chapter fraternity house based on a fraternity playbook for targeting women. The Phi Kappa Tau  national chapter, the now suspended local chapter and the chapter adviser are named as defendants in both lawsuits. These aren't lawsuits "against the perpetrator. The student was pursued by the school and expelled. (Phi Kappa Tau) failed to take action and allowed a dangerous environment to fester, allowing the rape of two women," Cari Simon, the attorney representing the two women, told CNN on Friday. Simon's firm said the same fraternity member was involved in both incidents. No criminal charges have been filed, the fraternity said. "The complaints highlight an offensive email and disturbing statements made in 2013 by chapter members and attempt to somehow link the alleged sexual assaults in 2012 and 2014 to that conduct," the fraternity said in a statement. "The Fraternity is disappointed that the plaintiffs' attorney chose to exploit the hypersensitivity of today's college environment towards sexual assault by drafting the complaints in a manner that sensationalizes completely inappropriate statements, while at the same time alleging that a Georgia Tech student committed criminal rapes of two different women." Simon, the plaintiffs' attorney, said, "I totally agree that the language is salacious, but it's the words of their own members." She said the suits were seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Opinion: 'Rapebait' email reveals dark side of frat culture The leaked email contained references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion and attracted the attention of online communities and social media sites. The fraternity member who wrote the email apologized in Georgia Tech's student newspaper last year. Identified only as "Matthew," he said that he was his chapter's social chair and that the email was a joke and should never have been written in the first place. Matthew wrote the email but is not the person accused of sexual assault.	1
The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour. Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Âme Laval have stepped forward to take over for the departing Wintour, but neither has expressed interest in the job, leaving us to consider what the industry is saying about their abilities to succeed them.Who would you call to replace them? And for that matter what did you think of the interviews with both Wintour and Laval?A: For years, I've felt that Anna Wintour seemed to embody exactly what they both are, with her sense of confidence and her ability to find the right balance between what is truly important and what is trendy. Laval seems to have taken a more aggressive-looking approach in the recent interview, and I worry that she can be so aggressive that she will end up alienating readers (especially given how many fashion weeks she attends in the next year).J: Both have strong fashion credentials and are very well-respected. Laval was actually one of the first fashion editors to join the Vogue team when Wintour and the other editors began working there. She's a very influential editor, having edited many of the most important fashion magazines, including The New Yorker and Vanity Fair.A: I think it's important to remember that Anna Wintour isn't the only person to step into that role. Both Laval and I are well known for being passionate about fashion. In addition to the other editors, there are many people and organizations that are doing wonderful work creating fashion and women's magazines, and it seems to make sense that they would take over for their boss.J: Laval is someone who has a very strong fashion background. She has edited several Vogue editorially and is a frequent contributor to the magazine. And I'm really excited to see what she does with Vogue and the brand as we move forward.A: I am happy to hear that you think Laval has the strong background to succeed Anna. I hope that she will be successful.J: And I also hope that you feel the same way.A: I feel that Anna was the right person to take on the role, but she's going to have to be able to balance being the boss and having people working for her.

Champions League holders Barcelona survived a scare in Germany on Tuesday evening as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's second-half equalizer earned them a 1-1 last 16 first leg draw against urns FC Lokomotiv Moscow. Ibrahimovic had put Lokomotiv ahead early on with a brace, but their equalizer was a game-changer as FC Barcelona moved on to face Eibar in the quarter-finals.The night started with the same story the first half had: a good start to a game that was ultimately undone by the second effort, this time from Ibrahimovic. The striker, who netted a hat-trick in the first leg, turned in a clinical performance to beat Bayern Munich on a one-two at the end of the first half. After that, the scoring didn’t stop.After a slow start to the second half, Ibrahimovic doubled Barcelona’s lead in the 58th minute with an unstoppable free kick. The Swede followed this with a goal of his own, this time from a corner. Ibrahimovic added his third after the break with an equalizer from a penalty kick.The second-leg clash at the Westfalenstadion saw the best of Barcelona vs Bayern Munich.It was an extraordinary night for Ibrahimovic.

We must be on you but cannot see you." That was one of the very last voice signals transmitted by Amelia Earhart in the summer of 1937, somewhere over the vast Pacific Ocean during her ill-fated flight around the globe. An ichthyologist who had worked with John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, says: "It is the most romantic thing in the world, to think that you get to communicate with your spouse."It's not that it was particularly romantic, in fact, and it's not that it was particularly romantic for Earhart's husband, Ted. During the few weeks of their marriage, there is one occasion on which, we recall from their first recorded telephone conversation, they discuss their respective spouses, their wives, their children, and the future."Is your wife a good tennis player?" Earhart asks."She's a ball-buster," Ted says."Do you play tennis?""No, not tennis," Ted says. "No, I'll play tennis one day. I'll have to do something to stay in shape, I'll tell you that much."By the end of their marriage, however, Ted had given up tennis and was a golf enthusiast, though he wasn't a great golfer: it wasn't until his second marriage, to Ann, a good bridge player, that he began to play golf seriously. For a man who was once a mediocre amateur golfer, these were astonishing accomplishments. He now plays on a regular basis and has won three major golf tournaments: the U.S. Amateur, a very prestigious golf event, and the British Open, an annual event held at Royal St. George's, near Bath.The couple's decision to divorce was not an easy one. In his first book, _On the Trail of Amelia Earhart_ , author and explorer Donald L. Miller describes how, as a child, Earhart told him that she was the "only woman in America that I hated," and he quotes her as complaining that Ted was a "nasty-tempered man" who "was too sensitive and too romantic to be a good husband."Though she didn't seem bitter about her husband's lack of physical passion, it seemed to her that he didn't want to experience the emotional side of marriage. "I could never quite understand why he had to hold his head so high—when all he	0
I met Whitney Houston after the debut of her first self-titled album on Arista Records. She was poised, graceful and strong. She was also sweet and laughed easily. This seems unremarkable today other than the fact that strong women were not vernacular at the time, even if they were very real. A strong career began and Whitney experienced two more albums, but her journey ended in tragedy. Whitney’s first-ever visit to Graceland was on Saturday, November 11, 2002 and her memorial service was on the following Sunday.That’s the kind of career Whitney had. Whitney had more success than most singers, which is why she was known as “the first female superstar.” She also had a long string of record deals, and so were her other hits. Whitney’s first album, Whitney, was released in 1980. It was a big seller, selling five million copies in the USA by the time it hit shelves. This is a number that’s not unusual in music, but she made a huge dent in the market with the second studio album, The Bodyguard. The title track became her biggest hit. Whitney has the distinction of being the only female to date to achieve a No. 1 hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album was certified diamond in the USA and also gold in Canada, Australia and the UK. The album was released on Atlantic Records, and it went platinum there. Whitney was so popular that her follow-up album, the double-disc Sweet Thing, went gold in the USA, making it her most profitable release so far. The album became a single-release in the U.K. Whitney was named the “Queen of Soul” and ranked third behind Patti LaBelle and Bette Midler in the MTV audience ratings. The album was certified diamond in Canada and platinum in the U.K. Two further albums followed, but all three were certified platinum. Whitney’s fourth album, The Remix, sold more copies than the best sellers of the previous era, which makes it a classic in the discography. It was certified diamond in Canada and the UK, and was awarded platinum status in Australia and the U.S. Whitney had now become one of the best selling female artists in the world and also the most commercially successful. This was not a new phenomenon. The success of Madonna, Cee Lo Green, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears	0
A newly released ISIS video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an Israeli spy. The video identifies the man as 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. In the video, ISIS shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS. "Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him," according to Said Musallam, his father. "They sent him money through the Western Union. They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing." It wasn't long before Musallam's family members didn't recognize him when they talked to him on Skype. The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle. His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross. But his son never made it back to Israel. About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border. A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit. An adult ISIS fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him. The adult, speaking French, gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing. The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead. The man immediately falls forward to the ground. The child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body. Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death. "I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work," he said, crying. "Mohamed is not a brother. He is a son." But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead.	1
A strong earthquake shook central Japan on Saturday night, injuring dozens of people and destroying homes in a well-known ski resort, authorities said. Reports differed on the intensity of the quake, centered in a remote mountainous area of Nagano prefecture. The Japan Meteorological Agency reported it was magnitude 6.8; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said it was magnitude 6.2. One of the hardest hit areas was the skiing village of Hakuba, where at least seven housing and storage structures collapsed. Seven of the 39 people hurt in the quake suffered serious injuries, Nagano prefectural police said. Japanese television stations carried images of landslides that had cut off roads and railroads, as well as flattened houses and warped highways. More than 300 rescue workers were deployed to search for people trapped in collapsed homes. Authorities said the rescue operation was completed. No electric facilities, including nuclear power plants, were damaged, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said via Twitter Saturday. Aftershocks followed the main quake Saturday night, including one measured at magnitude 4.1, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.	1
Alabama rode the tide of a commanding halftime lead to beat Notre Dame 42 to 14 to win the BCS National Championship game at Miami Gardens, Florida. The No. 2 Crimson Tide scored on drives of 82, 61 and 80 yards against the top-ranked and undefeated Irish in its first three drives of the game. They added a 71-yard scoring drive with 31 seconds left in the half to take a dominating 28-0 lead. By that time, despite the fact that the half of the game was yet to be played, many commenters on Twitter were jokingly wondering if Notre Dame would come out of the locker room for the second half. The Irish did, but it did not get much better for them. In fact, one of the biggest hits of the game on Alabama's quarterback A.J. McCarron came from his own teammate Barrett Jones. The two teammates disagreed on a play call and had to call a timeout to get it cleared up. McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game. Notre Dame also couldn't stop Alabama's running game. Crimson Tide runners Eddie Lacy and T.J. Yeldon both ran for more than 100 yards. Alabama has now won three national titles in the last four years, which had some calling them a dynasty. "You can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort," McCarron said after the game. Alabama coach Nick Saban did not shy away from the D- word. Saban said it was the team's work ethic that has brought so many victories. "Because we have a great team we have been able to have a significant amount of success," Saban said. The last team to win three national championships in four years was Nebraska in 1994, 1995, and 1997. The '97 championship was split with Michigan. Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team will learn from the loss. "We are not there yet," Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. "Alabama showed us that in the way they played the game. We got a lot of work left to do to get back here." Bleacher Report coverage of the national title game	1
One poker player gave new meaning to the saying "throwing money down the drain." Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, flushed $2.7 million worth of counterfeit poker chips down the toilet in a room at Harrah's Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey state police said. He was arrested over the weekend, police said. Lusardi disposed of the fake chips he was using during the Winter Poker Open's "Big Stack, No Limit Hold 'Em" event at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, police said. Tournament personnel found 160 of the counterfeit poker chips -- each with a value of $5,000, for a total of $800,000 -- among the genuine casino chips, police said. The discovery in clogged sewer pipes prompted Harrah's to notify Borgata officials. The counterfeit chips forced officials to suspend the event for 24 hours. Soon after, the tournament was canceled. "This was a very unusual occurrence. It's the first time in Borgata's 10 years that anything like this has happened," Joe Lupo, senior vice president of operations at Borgata, told CNN. Authorities found Lusardi Friday at a motel in Atlantic City. Legendary gambler accused of marking cards in California casino "We are very pleased that the New Jersey State Police Casino Gaming Bureau has apprehended a suspect," Lupo said. "While this is a very positive development, the investigation by the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the State Police is ongoing." Police say Lusardi introduced the counterfeit chips into the tournament on multiple occasions. Lusardi obtained $6,814 in winnings during the tournament. Lusardi was charged with rigging a publicly exhibited contest, criminal attempt, and theft by deception. He was being held on $300,000 bail, with no option to pay 10%, at the Atlantic City Jail, police said. The poker tournament began in mid-January with more than 4,800 people enrolled. When it was canceled Friday, 27 people remained in the tournament. Gambler gives $10K reward to Vegas cabbie who found his $300K	1
A very wise district attorney once gave a piece of pragmatic advice to a young assistant prosecutor investigating a prominent political figure. The case involved evidence that could possibly support a criminal indictment yet was unlikely to  be admissible at trial.""This is the kind of case where you don't turn on the lights and pull up the blinds," said the young prosecutor, "and the light and the blinds are all you have to go on."It takes a determined investigative approach to build a strong case against a dangerous murderer. The prosecution must establish the existence of a legally viable claim against the accused and identify a high probability that the crime  committed is indeed the crime of which the accused is charged. But the evidence that must ultimately persuade a jury to determine guilt or innocence can frequently appear to be so thin as to be in question.The legal system of the United States is based on a legal principle known as the presumption of innocence. This principle says that the law does not presume guilt of any person accused until and unless evidence is produced that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.But the legal presumption of innocence is undermined by the prosecution's failure to present admissible evidence as to the case against the accused. Such failure results in the prosecution effectively  eliminating the presumption of innocence on a case-by-case basis, which is what the prosecution has done in this case.This is the real story behind the killing of Robert Marker by Robert Schmerler. The facts of the case are very unusual, and the law is even more unusual. Yet from the facts are distilled lessons that should guide the justice system.## The Facts Are UnexpectedThe story of the killing of Robert Marker is unique. It is also unusual because the defendant, Robert Schmerler, is a highly respected police officer and a retired police chief. Because of the unusual nature of the case, Schmerler's credibility appears to be as close to rock-solid as that of any law enforcement official.Robert Marker's murder is also unusual because the victim was not convicted in any criminal court, and no other person was ever charged with or convicted of the crime for any reason.Robert Marker was murdered by an individual who has not yet been identified. The prosecutor who prosecuted the Marker case has gone to great lengths to conceal the victim's identity during the prosecution and investigation of the case. At present, the only person who	0
A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 struck off the coast of Japan on Sunday, the U.S. ʻs Japan Meteorological Agency said.A 7.1 magnitude earthquake with a depth of 35.4 km struck off the coast of the northeastern prefecture of Miyagi at 12:47 p.m. on January 4, the agency said. No injuries or deaths have been reported. The region was also hit by a magnitude 6.2 aftershock on January 6.The earthquake hit more than 1,000 kilometres northeast of Tokyo, with its epicentre more than 1,400 kilometres southwest of the capital, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported."This was a strong, deep earthquake," said Seiji Yoshimi, a spokesman at the agency. "It hit the seabed very hard."Japan, hit hard by a series of devastating earthquakes and strong-motion quakes in 2011 and 2012, has become a regional focal point of the region's destructive quake zone.Yoshimi said the quake was felt across Japan, according to a report from broadcaster NHK. "Even a large and shallow earthquake can cause serious damage. We did not expect such an aftershock," NHK quoted Yoshimi as saying.The region has been hit by seven magnitude-6 earthquakes in the last 30 years.In June last year, a magnitude-6 earthquake hit western Japan, resulting in damage and a dozen deaths. It killed two people and damaged some 3,500 homes.An earthquake of magnitude 5.9 struck the western prefecture of Saitama in May. It was felt from the capital Tokyo to nearby Saitama City.AftershocksThere were no aftershocks after Sunday's quake.The Japan Meteorological Agency said the epicentre was more than 1,400 kilometres southwest of Tokyo, near what is known as the "Ring of Fire."The northern Pacific Ocean is "wide open" during winter months due to ice, the agency said. The ring of geologically active islands arcs out from the central part of the Pacific Ocean, with Japan close to the centre."This kind of earthquake can severely damage buildings and cause some tsunami," Yoshimi said. The agency will issue a red warning for any aftershocks, Yoshimi said.Tokyo Electric Power Company was able to	0
North Korea is facing possibly its worst drought in 50 years, state media reported this week. May is on track to be the driest since 1962, with rainfall of less than a quarter of an inch (2-5 mm) recorded in major cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency said. The dry conditions are expected to continue into early June, North Korea's Rodong newspaper reported, citing a state weather official. Rain during the last 30 days has been lower than normal in the North, according to Jang Hyun-sik with the South Korean Meteorological Administration. "On average, it is supposed to rain in the range of 70-90 mm (2.75 to 3.5 inches) during this period," Jang said, noting that South Korean forecasters do not directly communicate with their counterparts in the North. Rodong reported that the drought has delayed the planting of corn and has already damaged crops like wheat, barley and potatoes, but said irrigation "can fight off the damage." North Korea's food shortages are well documented.  The World Food Program says more than 6 million people in the reclusive nation don't have enough to eat. South Korean Unification Ministry's spokesman Kim Hyung-suk Seoul is open to allowing private organizations to provide humanitarian aid to the North. No food aid is likely to come from the United States.  Washington canceled its plan for food shipments after Pyongyang launched a rocket on April 13. North Korea said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology. The move torpedoed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments.	1
Last week began with a missing persons report filed for Katherine Jackson but ended with Michael Jackson's mother attending a "Unity" concert by four of her sons. In the days between, a complex family feud played out in headlines and on  television, pitting the eldest Jackson sibling against each of her sons and their "special" friends."The Jackson 5 will always be my baby, and she will always be my brother," Michael Jackson told USA Today on June 8. "We have so much in common."But the split between Michael and his younger siblings in the family has been long and acrimonious. Last month, the 25-year-old actor posted a photo on his Instagram account, in which he thanked his former stepbrothers, who he called family, for being the best people in the world. "Truly blessed to have had the best family in the world," he wrote.The rift started when Michael, then 16, discovered that his father, Michael Sr., had been unfaithful to his wife, Debbie Rowe, with the 17-year-old Michael, who has a younger brother named Randy, and began acting out. The oldest Jackson sibling left home and started dating a woman named Jackie Daniels, but Jackson's father stopped paying child support in 1995 and the two families separated.Michael's relationship with the Jackson 5, which had been harmonious until the siblings, who appeared on ABC's "20/20" in 2006, began to argue and fight over money, became increasingly problematic. The youngest Jackson child, named Jeromy, is an accomplished basketball player who is a two-time All-Star in the NBA. Jeromy, 22, left the basketball team to play for a professional football team in 2007 and was arrested for shoplifting in 2011 and again in 2012. He was finally arrested for gun possession in 2012, which led to a court battle in which he claimed that he was the victim of a hit. In 2013, Jeromy's mother, Lisa Marie Presley, filed a complaint against her estranged husband claiming that he had assaulted Jeromy.In June, Michael Jackson filed a complaint against his siblings with the United States Marshal's Office in Los Angeles, claiming that they were behind the disappearance of a friend named Christopher "Chopper" Chattaway. Jackson asked the agency to search for his friend and said he wanted to be reunited with him soon."My mom told me '	0
The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded a deadly accident involving a bus driver who fell asleep while driving on a Virginia interstate last year was caused in part by "acute sleep loss" as well as inadequate oversight by the bus company and the government. Four people died on May 31, 2011, when a motorcoach operated by Sky Express Inc., with 59 people on board bound for New York, drifted off Interstate 95 near Richmond, Virginia, around 5 a.m. The bus struck a cable barrier, rotated clockwise, then overturned. The roof was crushed. In addition to the four deaths, 49 other passengers were injured. The driver, Kin Yiu Cheung, was slightly injured and refused medical treatment, safety officials said. At a board meeting Tuesday, the safety board said that a 13-month investigation found the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle "because of fatigue resulting from acute sleep loss, poor sleep quality, and ... the failure of Sky Express Inc. management to follow adequate safety practices and to exercise safety oversight of the driver." "This crash never should have happened," said the board's chairman, Deborah A.P. Hersman. "It was entirely preventable. Those travelers were failed at three levels: by the driver, the operator and the regulator." The safety board ruled out alcohol, drugs, cell phone use, weather, mechanical defects, speed and highway design as playing any role in the accident. The report said the bus company's failure to "exercise even minimal oversight of its drivers' rest and sleep activities enabled the drivers to drive while dangerously fatigued." An examination of the driver's work schedule, sleep times and cell phone use revealed that his opportunity for sleep in the 72 hours prior to the crash was limited, the safety board said in a release. The board said another factor contributing to the accident was the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's lack of adequate oversight of North Carolina-based Sky Express, "which allowed the company to continue operations despite known safety issues." "Protecting the traveling public by strengthening bus and truck safety is FMCSA's number one priority," the federal organization whose primary mission is to prevent commercial motor-vehicle-related fatalities, said in a statement sent to CNN. "FMCSA closed the loophole that allowed 10-day extensions for passenger bus companies undergoing safety compliance reviews. It is also why our agency shut down 54 unsafe bus companies in 2011."	1
Every year the holidays bring cold weather, family gatherings, gift-giving, and of course, the perennial debate over the Constitution and Christmas. Recently, a Long Island school district drew criticism following a performance that removed the holier lyrics from the traditional Christmas song "Silent Night." Some parents objected when the fifth-grade choir at the school in Kings Park, New York, left out phrases such as "Christ the Savior". The school superintendent said the principal and choir director removed the references to avoid "offense to people of other faith," according to Newsday. But regardless of the reason, would it be legal for a school choir to perform "Silent Night" in its traditional form? To enter the fray we have to understand some of the basics about the often-uncertain relationship between the First Amendment and public schools. First, let's dispel the myths: The First Amendment does not ban all mention of any religion in public schools. As the Supreme Court has noted, "total separation (between church and state) is not possible in an absolute sense." After all, when our kids study world history, they are often studying religion. Wars, civilizations, exploration, and human culture have always been motivated in part by some form of dogma. To filter religion out of history leaves something that cannot, in good faith, still be called history. And while some Christmas music consists of light-hearted fare, other pieces are authored by Handel or Bach, and have undeniable value in a musical curriculum. Religion has always been a part of our civilization; the Constitution and our courts recognize this. Instead, the Establishment Clause only prohibits the "advancement" or the "inhibition" of religion by the state. Of course, that's a distinction that's much easier to describe than it is to identify in real life. When does a school cross the line into advancing or inhibiting religion? In 1971 the United States Supreme Court decided Lemon v. Kurtzman and formulated the "Lemon Test," which is a three-pronged evaluation of the constitutionality of legislation concerning religion. A court will consider the following: 1. The government's action must have a secular (non-religious) purpose.	1

Ukraine and Dynamo Kiev striker Andriy Shevchenko is hanging up his football boots to begin a career in politics. Ahead of the October parliamentary election, the 35-year-old Shevchenko, who scored 48 goals in 111 caps for his country, is to join "Ukraine -- Forward!", a pro-business party, which was formed by politicians who were expelled by the main opposition coalition that used to be led by former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. "It is certain, Dynamo Kiev is now my former club. This club, which I love with all my heart and I will always support," the former AC Milan and Chelsea forward told the Dynamo website. "I want to fulfill myself in politics and share the experience I gained in Europe, to do something for my country," said Shevchenko, while visiting a children's summer school with Ukraine -- Forward! leader Nataliya Korolevska. "I decided to join the team of Nataliya Korolevska because Ukraine -- Forward! is a party of the future, it is a party of young leaders. "In politics, I plan to support the social sector and sport. After all, my main slogan is a healthy mind in a healthy body." Shevchenko, who began and started his career with Dynamo Kiev, made his final appearance for the national team at Euro 2012, which Ukraine co-hosted with neighbours Poland. He is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to enter national politics. Heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko has his own political party -- the "Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform" -- and is expected to be a serious contender in October's elections.	1
The cause of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370's disappearance remains a mystery, but it has put the spotlight on the wildly varying approach governments with a stake in the search have handled the sensitivities and the facts. The Malaysian government has been roundly criticized for weeks of muddled misinformation and its seemingly off-hand dealings with the distraught families of the passengers and crew of the missing airliner. China, which has more than 150 of its citizens aboard the Boeing 777-200, has been unrelenting in its criticism of Malaysia's handling of the search and the lack of transparency in information, while Thailand was accused of withholding what might have been critical information about the MH370's possible flight path because it said no one had asked whether it had any intelligence. Out of the fray emerged Australia and its conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a man known more for his pugilistic, take-no-prisoner style of politics, than his statesmanship and compassion. On neither count has the Australian Premier, until now, impressed. Spy claims Abbott refused to apologize to the Indonesian President when the leaked Edward Snowden files revealed Australia had been spying on Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, including his wife. He has also run a tough, some say brutal, campaign against asylum seekers and the people smugglers who bring them to Australia across treacherous waters from Indonesia. Abbott, who accuses asylum seekers of illegally attempting to enter Australia, is comfortable with the policy masterminded by his predecessor, of sending those who seek refuge in Australia to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru -- neither considered by the UNHCR to be adequate to house them. Recently, the government announced it would stop funding legal assistance for asylum seekers who arrived by boat and are sitting in detention centers awaiting the chance to argue their case. But when he rose to his feet on March 20 to tell the Australian Parliament that new satellite images showed what might be aircraft debris in the Indian Ocean, some 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) off the coast of Western Australia and that an Australian-led search party would be investigating, Abbott made international headlines. Statesmanship peaked out from behind the curtains. When days later no debris had been found, Abbott deflected criticism that he had jumped the gun saying the search area was "about the most inaccessible spot that you would imagine on the face of the earth.	1
Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and memories. The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton's shooting spree Tuesday, which ended when he took his own life. "We're a pretty tight neighborhood," said Mary Bey of South Windsor, at the funeral of Craig Pepin, 60, who she described as a "wonderful neighbor and friend and coach and referee." "He touched so many people's lives in South Windsor ... he was a very unique, kind and wonderful man," she told CNN Connecticut affiliate WTNH. Bey also knows a Hartford Distributors employee who was injured in the rampage. "We're very happy he made it through," she said of Steven Hollander, a neighbor who was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Besides Pepin, Bryan Cirigliano, 51, Douglas Scruton, 56, and Victor James, who was killed on his 61st birthday, were also buried Saturday. "We've just had an outpouring of support," James' daughter told WTNH. "And it just felt good to hear the stories and just to see the amount of people that came to see my dad." Funeral services for two other shooting victims are scheduled for Sunday and Monday, and a candlelight vigil for those killed is scheduled for Sunday evening in Manchester's Center Park. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims, asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m. On Friday, police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton. Hartford Distributors said it had asked Thornton to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union.	1
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party won Sunday's parliamentary elections, but appeared to fall just short of obtaining a super majority, according to preliminary results released early Monday. Merkel's bloc -- Ã¢ÂÂAlternative for GermanyÃ¢ÂÂ -- secured 37.13 percent of the vote, just 0.4 percentage points shy of Merkel's overall tally. Still, she would still have needed a simple majority, or the support of a single coalition party, to secure the absolute majority that German voters have sought since 1949.Merkel's conservative and environmentalist bloc, which came to power with coalition partners in 1994, has governed as a grand coalition since 2000 -- an arrangement that has ensured the stability of the party-led government, but raised fears that the government could slide into conflict with other forces or break apart at any time. Sunday's vote was the second of this year's parliamentary election, after a run-off that took place on Saturday.Germany's Social Democrats, who came to power in 1989, are the largest opposition party, with 18.6 percent of the vote. The Greens, a much smaller, environmentally-focused party, came on top with 13.5 percent. Neither Social Democrat nor Green leader Sigmar Gabriel immediately challenged Merkel's leadership following the election results.The Christian Democratic Union, which has governed since 1949, was the only other party to vote as a bloc with Merkel's conservatives and the Greens. The CDU, which holds a super majority in German parliament, won 24.9 percent of the vote, according to preliminary election results.It will take Merkel the full five years to achieve a parliamentary majority, and there was speculation that she and the CDU could fail to get a deal on a governing coalition with the Social Democrats. The talks dragged on throughout Sunday night and into Monday morning, with both sides accusing the other of being disloyal and saying the talks would only take place if there was a majority for a coalition.But Merkel appeared to have secured a majority for her bloc, as early as Thursday night when she was joined by the CDU and Greens leader in a meeting with Bavarian premier Horst Seehofer. They agreed on a draft party program that included support for pension reform. But they also acknowledged that a deal was still needed between two parties in Bavaria, the CSU and the FDP. On Friday, they agreed on a deal that	0
It really depends what you want. Boy? Girl? Young? Old?" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and  forth between two boys that were still kids, we discovered that it was the young boys who were the most appealing, and we ended up chatting on the phone until they agreed to be our first clients—to have us.I will never forget the night the two boys were waiting on the porch outside my house with two glasses of wine. I poured them a glass each, and then handed the bottle back to the younger of the two children. "Please take good care of this," I said, then added, "You can open it when you're older." They were both very young, and both were pretty, and they seemed to be very excited about what we were going to do. I don't know what I expected that evening, but nothing could have prepared me for what came next. The first boy took the glass and poured himself a second glass. He looked at the younger boy, who was staring at him. "This is what I'm doing," he said, and he walked back into the house, leaving his glass on the porch. The older child stared after him for a moment, and then, in a quiet, almost submissive voice, asked, "Would you like to be my first client?" The younger boy looked at me questioningly, and I could tell that this was exactly what he'd been waiting to hear. This was no dream. This was reality.After I'd closed the door on the two children, I felt a little scared, but not a whole lot. In that quiet moment when I didn't know what to do, I realized that every time I ever felt scared, I would make a decision about how to deal with it. Instead of being scared, I decided to use that moment to make sure I was making a decision at all.It was a little less than a week after that conversation with the children that I opened my first legal office. I had a client before I even knew what a legal office was. My client had been the woman who'd asked me, "How much is a legal?"She'd given me forty dollars to give her. She'd been given a bill. I didn't have the bill, but I had that woman's money. And I wanted to give it	0
More than 2,100 registered North Carolina sex offenders were found on the social networking site MySpace, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday. North Carolina bans sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members. In response to a subpoena from state Attorney General Roy Cooper, "MySpace turned over the names, IP and e-mail addresses of 2,116 convicted North Carolina sex offenders found on its social networking Web site," Cooper's office said in a written statement. Cooper has requested similar information from Facebook, another popular social networking site, the statement said. MySpace has told North Carolina authorities that the sex offenders it identified have been removed from the site. North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation is sharing the sex offenders' information with all 100 sheriffs in the state, Cooper's office said. "It's no secret that child predators are on these Web sites," Cooper said in the statement. "Turning over information about these predators to law enforcement helps, but MySpace, Facebook and other social networks need to do much more to protect kids online." North Carolina passed a law last year banning sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members, making it a felony offense. Sex offenders on social networking sites is not a new issue. Last month, Newsweek magazine reported that Facebook said it had removed 5,585 convicted sex offenders from its site between May 2008 and January 2009. MySpace also announced it had removed 90,000 sex offenders in a two-year period, the magazine said. Last June, the Texas attorney general's office said it had arrested seven convicted sex offenders who violated their parole conditions by creating MySpace profiles, according to an article on the TechNewsWorld Web site. Cooper and Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, for more than three years have led a group of attorneys general in working to make social networking safer, Cooper's office said. The group is pushing social networks to use technology such as age and identity verification to better protect users who may be children. After discussions with the group, MySpace became the first social networking site to develop technology aimed at finding and removing sex offenders, the North Carolina statement said. Cooper is pushing Facebook to take similar steps.	1
When Billy Beane, the subject of the 2004 book 'Moneyball', took over as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in the late 1990s, he revolutionized the way baseball teams were run. At a time when other managers and scouts relied on their experience to identify promising new players, Beane successfully used 'sabermetrics' -- the statistical analysis of baseball -- to see value in players other teams had passed over, turning the Athletics into a team capable of competing with the biggest names in the sport. Now industry watchers say a similar statistics revolution is going on in the business world. Technological advances are giving rise to huge amounts of data -- about consumers, supply chains and world events -- that businesses can use to make better decisions and gain a competitive edge. It's called 'big data analytics', and those who ignore it are being warned they risk being left behind. Watch: Funding 80 start-ups at once The rise of big data "Big data is the new oil," says Andy Cutler, director of strategy at SAS, a consulting firm specializing in big data analytics. "The folks who are going to get good value are those who are going to be able to refine it and turn it into useful products." Firms like Amazon and Netflix are at the forefront of this revolution, gathering the huge amounts of data generated by their customers and analyzing it to predict what customers will want to buy or watch in the future. This goes beyond personalized purchase suggestions; Amazon is currently working on technology that will deliver products to you before you've even ordered them, or at least keep them in warehouses nearby in anticipation, says Phil Simon, author of "Too Big to Ignore: The Business Case for Big Data." Netflix has effectively built its entire business model on analyzing customer data, he says. "Netflix track every view, every click, all in an attempt to understand what their customers want." The development of smartphone technologies and near-field communication means analyzing customer data is no longer limited to the online world. Tailored buying experience Arne Strauss, analytics professor at the Warwick Business School, says retailers are developing ways of monitoring customers as they enter physical stores, allowing them to optimize store layout and even change on-shelf promotions depending on which customer is walking by. But predicting customer behavior is just one application. Major banks including HSBC use big data to monitor and predict fraud -- both by cardholders and staff -- by setting up data-mining systems that collect patterns and look for anomalies.	1
Ain Shams University Biologist Hebat Abdel Hadi is taking "waste not, want not" to a whole other level. Alphonso Van Marsh discovered first hand how damaging the Nile crayfish can be. She says crayfish carcasses the part of the ichthyological world most misunderstood."We're seeing a lot of crayfish being released in the rivers and ponds, and it's a nuisance as it creates dead zones along the river bank and reduces the biodiversity and fertility of the water, and it's not good for human habitation," said Al Khuwarian. The Nile crayfish is a small, black species of fish commonly known as crayfish, known for its long-body cylindrical shape and its ability to filter out harmful bacteria and parasites from the water, making the Nile crayfish a major cause of water pollution and nutrient depletion. Al Khuwarian added that the Nile crayfish is classified as a "near-threatened species" as it is declining in abundance. Al Khuwarian and her team conducted surveys to find out how the Nile crayfish is impacting the livelihood of fishermen in Egypt."I think there's a misconception among some people that because we live under their feet in Egypt, we know what we're doing, and this is one of the major problems we've had. We used to release them by the boat or just drop them down a deep well in the riverbed. But now the crayfish are being dropped over the river bank, and they're creating a nuisance for other aquatic species." - Ali Al Khuwarian"A lot of the crayfish I've seen have a very dark hue to them, and you can tell they're dead on the outside and a fresh corpse inside. They have to be dead before they become edible."Crayfish can be eaten and sold in some parts of Egypt, but Alkhurwarian said it is not legal to sell crayfish in Egypt. She said that once they are dead, they must be killed within two hours of arrival to kill all harmful bacteria from their digestive tract."To me, it's the first time we've seen any type of dead crayfish. They're always found on the shores of the Nile River, and they're always very fresh. Crayfish are one of the major aquatic species in the Nile	0
A bedbug outbreak at two trendy New York retail shops has sounded the alarm among city residents and businesses, prompting calls for the city to examine how it deals with the prickly pests. Hollister, a popular clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch in the fashionable Soho neighborhood, remained closed Friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week, according to company spokeswoman Iska Hain. And an Abercrombie & Fitch store in South Street Seaport also has been closed by an infestation. Abercrombie and Fitch said Friday afternoon the problem in the SoHo Hollister store had been taken care of and the shop will reopen Saturday morning. "The company has requested guidance from the mayor's office on how businesses in Manhattan should deal with this issue," the company said in a news release. "In the meantime, the company's first priority continues to be its customers and associates." The incidents mirror a sharp overall spike in bedbugs in recent years, yet efforts to combat the problem have mostly focused on residential buildings, leaving the issue of contamination in commercial spaces largely ignored. "We've had them in banks, grocery stores, movie theaters, judge's chambers, schools, dentists' offices -- everywhere," said Jeff Eisenberg of PestAway, an exterminating company in Manhattan. The problem, according to Eisenberg, is that bedbugs carry a stigma, which causes many cases to go unreported. "It's like a don't ask, don't tell policy," he said. "People don't tell their employers that they have bedbugs in their house" -- bedbugs that can hitch a ride to the workplace. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. For the first half of 2010, 1,976 bedbug violation notices have already been written. However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market. Owners of bedbug-infested residences are less likely to call 311, the city's non-emergency hotline, which then notifies the Housing Preservation Department. Further, landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation.	1
Three British guards jumped overboard and were rescued from the water after battling in vain to prevent pirates hijacking a chemical tanker off the coast of Somalia. Three British security guards board a helicopter to be transferred to a Royal Navy vessel. The Liberian-flagged Biscaglia came under "sustained and heavy attack" early Friday morning, Nick Davis, Director of Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), said in a statement. The three APMSS-employed security guards -- all former British servicemen -- mounted "sustained non-lethal resistance" but were unable to stop the attackers seizing control of the ship, Davis said. The trio were airlifted to safety by a German naval helicopter and flown to a French frigate after the vessel summoned assistance from coalition warships. They were later transferred to a British Royal Navy ship. All three were unhurt, Davis said. "I have spoken with my team leader on the phone and he informs me that the level of violence was significant and forced them reluctantly to leave the vessel after every effort was made to ensure the safety of the ships crew," Davis said. Pirates continued to shoot at the three in the water, Davis said. "The hijacked vessel with pirates in control then attempted to run them down." The Biscaglia is managed by Singapore-based Ishima and owned by Winged Foot Shipping in the Marshall Islands and was crewed by 25 Indians and two Bangladeshis who are believed to be still onboard. The vessel is believed to be on its way to an anchorage in Puntland, northeastern Somalia, Davis said. iReport.com: Share your view from 'Inside Africa' Also Friday, pirates released the Greek ship MV Centauri, which was hijacked in September off the coast of Somalia, according to Andrew Mwangura, the head of the Kenya Seafarers Association. There was no immediate information about the 25 crew members on board the ship when it was taken. A multinational naval force including vessels from the U.S., NATO member states, Russia and India has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters seas near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, following a sharp increase in pirate attacks in the region. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year.	1
Feasting on turkey aside, brace yourself for that other Thanksgiving ritual: joining a nationwide mad dash to make it to a family gathering and back in a journey that can exasperate even the most seasoned traveler. If you're flying for the holiday, expect lots of company and few airfare deals. "The airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and (they're) using smaller planes," said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com. "So there are going to be fewer seats." It's also a bit trickier to book flights for Thanksgiving than Christmas because so many travelers want to fly in such a small window of time: four days versus two weeks for many people who save vacation time for the big holiday in December. The sputtering economy isn't keeping Americans from making the annual trek for Thanksgiving, said Melissa Klurman, contributing editor for Travelocity. Those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $376 on average for a domestic ticket, or about 4% more than at the same time last year, according to Travelocity. Here are five tips to make your journey a smoother one. 1. Book your tickets now Last-minute sales aren't likely for one of the most popular times of the year to fly and seat maps are filling up quickly. "Don't delay: Prices are not going to go down between now and Thanksgiving," Klurman said. "Not only do you have a better chance of getting lower airfare, but also (better) seats. You can book your seat when you book your airfare. So if you don't want to be in the middle of the last row -- the early bird gets the window seat in that case." If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said. 2. Look into alternate airports Sometimes, it pays to look into flying in and out of airports that may be less convenient than your closest option. So you may find a cheaper flight out of Allentown, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia, for example, Hobica said. Be especially flexible if you're in a major city like New York, where there are several airports in the area, Klurman said. Travelocity allows fliers to search alternate airports when they're pricing itineraries. 3. Consider flying on Thanksgiving Day	1
The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike. Lawmakers approved the measure by a count of 17 to 16, with six Republicans voting in opposition. The bill, Ã¢ÂÂSenate Bill 17,Ã¢ÂÂ by Republican state legislators is the first piece of legislation that would strip public workers of collective bargaining rights. The measure was passed by an overwhelmingly Republican legislature, after it was stripped of its last major legislative hurdle as soon as it received approval. The final passage of a bill by the Ohio Senate was held up by a few House members who voted for their opposition to the bill in a closed door meeting. Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs about time that we had action and that we were moving on this,Ã¢ÂÂ said Senate President Keith Faber (R-Cleveland). He said that with the current Republican control of the General Assembly, it is time for action. Faber said that the Republican-led Legislature is taking away the collective bargaining rights of OhioÃ¢ÂÂs public workers in order to help their stateÃ¢ÂÂs budget. Ã¢ÂÂThis is the beginning of the end of public sector collective bargainingÃ¢ÂÂ, said Faber. House Majority Leader Tim Ryan was on hand for the vote and told WBTV that there were enough Republican votes to pass the bill out of committee. Republican committee members who voted for the bill, according to WBTV, were: House Minority Leader Tom Kearney (R-Lakewood), Republican Majority Whip Bill Johnson (R-Marion), House Speaker Mike Turzai (R-North Ridgeville), Republican Majority Leader David Leland (R-Zanesville), and Republican House Caucus Chairman Mark Hill (R-Marion). Ã¢ÂÂFor this budget,Ã¢ÂÂ said Kearney, Ã¢ÂÂthey want to pay less for the education that weÃ¢ÂÂve all taken for granted as students in that state.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe money is too important and the collective bargaining process is too	0
Lego boss Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who pulled the iconic toy brand back into profit, says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality. Knudstorp believes Europeans think they are wealthier than they are, despite three years of a global financial crisis. With the crisis continuing to roil markets and destabilize the banking sector, "it's about all of us recognizing that we have lost a bit of our wealth," he says. Lego lost its way in the late 90s and went deeply into debt before rebounding to double digit growth under Knudstorp's leadership. Knudstorp suggests European finance ministers could learn from Danish manufacturer's experience. "My piece of advice would be: face the truth -- that is what I learned the hard way in our company." Knudstorp says Lego went too deeply into debt, as Europe has also done. According to Knudstorp, stemming the crisis will begin by saying: "Yes we are over-indebted, we are sorry, we screwed up." He believes Europe needs to write-off some of its debt to avoid a stagnant economy for the next decade. "I think we are moving from a 30 year period of just borrowing more and more money at the government level and also at the household level," Knudstorp says. However, he says, Europe is entering a phase where raw material costs could increase while the availability for cheap labor around the world will decline. At Lego, Knudstorp will be focused on ensuring the company adapts to the changing economic conditions, which he believes are crucial to ensure survival. Lego is also renewing its portfolio of products, and plans to launch toys specifically designed for girls. But Knudstorp also emphasis the needs to keep things simple. "You need to challenge your organization all the time, to stay coherent, not make things too complicated," he says. "A lot of productivity is lost inside the company when things get complicated." CNN's Emily Smith has contributed to this report.	1
As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women. But her latest project is possibly her most ambitious yet: creating the Middle East's first museum dedicated to the achievements of women. The museum, Bait al Banaat, or House of Women, in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, showcasing the contribution of women to the country's history. "Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story," said Ghubash. "Don't think because we are covered we are not empowered. "Women here were not in the media, but they were economically engaged and running businesses." The museum is the culmination of five years' work for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of her own money. "For me it was a full-time job but I had 20 volunteers of all nationalities working with me in their free time. It was nice to have people with different backgrounds involved," she said. In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in. "I was looking for a place to build and I came across a very old house that I remember from childhood," she said. "It used to be called Bait al Banaat because three unmarried women lived there. Something about the name came to life for me." Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized. Arianna Huffington tells women: 'Less stress, more living' The museum contains a room dedicated to the Emirati woman poet Ousha Bint Khalifa -- known as the Girl of Arabia, a gallery devoted to temporary art exhibitions, a collection of Arabian fragrances and oils, traditional jewelery and a women's study center. "It was very important for me to present the museum in the best way possible to attract a younger generation. I want them to enjoy their culture and heritage," said Ghubash.	1
Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. It could be an uphill battle. J.M. Smucker Co. wants to assure ersusethesalmonesto keep on buying their peanut butter in Georgia and elsewhere. In an interview, Smucker Co. spokesman Steve Jones said, "[T]his salmonella outbreak has been so bad it has affected almost all companies that make peanut butter in the U.S. It is not just the J.M. Smucker Company. There's almost utes.The company is looking into its sales data and looking for any patterns to see what could be done to try to reassure peanut butter makers in Georgia not to stockpile peanut butters in preparation of a possible outbreak.Salmonella was found in the J.M. Smucker Co. peanut butter plant at its plant on Dec. 1, but the company did not immediately know the source of the contamination.The company said it is working with state and local health authorities and has taken all the necessary precautions to protect the health of its peanut butter recipe and the plant.A spokesman for J. M. Smucker Co., James D. Johnson, said Monday that "we have cooperated fully with the Georgia Department of Public Health as part of an investigation into a possible contamination of our peanut butter manufacturing facility."We have taken the necessary precautions to protect the health of our peanut butter recipe and the plant from harmful bacteria that are associated with salmonella. Our plant has been thoroughly inspected by outside health care agencies and state and local health authorities have been notified."Our company follows all legal requirements and standards for the safety of our peanut butter recipe, and we are taking every precaution to ensure that both the quality of our product and the safety of our peanut butter recipe remain unaffected by this unfortunate situation."In the event that a salmonella outbreak should occur, we will take all the steps necessary to ensure that our peanut butter recipe is unaffected and our customers remain safe throughout the outbreak by immediately re-stocking our product with the highest levels of natural peanut butter, as we did in the event of a salmonella food poisoning outbreak."The Department of Public Health, which is leading the investigation, said they were informed about the contaminated product as early as Dec. 24.	0
one in three uses some sort of sleep medication a few times a week. Many sleeping pills stop working after a few hours, and most should not be combined with other medications. Why do women have such trouble  on this medication?The sleep medication that is supposed to enhance sleep also affects the hormonal balance. That hormone, progesterone, causes the endometrial lining of the uterus to contract before bleeding. When the endometrial lining contracts, the uterine cells release more progesterone, which increases the risk of endometrial cancer.The women who sleep badly have a history of endometrial cancer or a family history of the disease. They also suffer from low progesterone levels, which may be caused by a disease or due to diet. They may also have a low estrogen or thyroid levels, which are known to interfere with progesterone production.If a woman is having trouble sleeping, she should make sure she eats a balanced diet and avoid caffeine. For added stress relief, a special pillow can be used. A pillow with a soft, contoured shape is better for stimulating the brain to fall into a state of relaxation.A pillow that has a curve at the bottom and a flat end provides the optimum amount of support, which means that there is less pressure underneath. Ideally, it should be filled with cotton, a fabric that is soft, but not fluffy. Even better, it should have a little weight in it. The weight helps distribute the pressure of your head falling into the pillow.If you feel sleepy, wake yourself up several times a night by gently tapping your head. If you want to experience deep sleep, you may need a massage rather than a pillow. A pillow that helps you to fall asleep or relax after a long day is a very effective stress reliever.If you feel that the pillow does not give you enough support, try a foam mattress. If you are experiencing a lot of stress from your work or busy life, a large pillow may be necessary.Carpet pillows come in four different styles: flat, rounded, rounded with a center, and a flat design with a rolled center. You can combine your preference with these pillow designs in a pillow sham.There are many different varieties of pillow sham available today, but remember: The most important thing is to have the right pillow. If you get a pillow that is not the right pillow, it could	0
Great Britain's rhythmic gymnastics team has won an appeal against a decision by its own federation to exclude them from the London  2012 Olympics.The appeal against the decision by the British Olympic Association, which was made earlier this month, had been scheduled for Wednesday morning when the gymnasts were due to be at the National Indoor Arena in Manchester.After the appeal proceedings had been suspended to allow gymnasts the chance to visit and be comforted in hospital, GB's appeal was heard at London's Court of Appeal on Thursday and the decision was handed down unanimously.The BOA had upheld a decision to strip the GB squad of its right to compete at the Games of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for failing to meet the minimum standards for all-round gymnastics.As a result, the British squad will compete in an eight-taught, multi-day event rather than as a single team, but will still qualify as a Great Britain team.In a statement read to the court, GB's president, Peter Walker, said: "This is one of the hardest decisions and hardest days we have ever had to make for the GB gymnasts."What we want to say to the BOC and the British Olympic Committee at this difficult time is: We are going to keep on striving."He added: "It's not over yet, but it will be a big sigh of relief to GB and everybody else involved in gymnastics as a sport when this decision is finally given the final, correct judgement and they know GB will be going forward."Fellow GB Olympians, Ellie Downie and Jessica Ennis-Hill, will now compete as Great Britain's first-ever medley gymnasts, which means they will no longer qualify as Great Britain's representative team.Downie had been given the opportunity to compete as the team's senior first-choice gymnast, while Ennis-Hill, who has struggled with back pain for most of this season, was given the chance to compete as an individual gymnast but would now be competing under GB's Olympic banner.Downie, a silver medallist and Olympic champion, was a member of the British team to win the Olympic and world titles in Los Angeles in 1996.She has won three medals at the World Championships in Budapest in 2011, 2012 and 2013, as well as five medals on the international circuit.	0
Remaking a landmark film ought to be a perfectly respectable proposition. After all, we see new versions of Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams all the time (whether on stage or screen). What's wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved Hollywood movie? In theory, nothing, yet in practice, it seldom works out well. There's something about how movies, with their singularity of mood and density of detail, imprint themselves on our imaginations that places the prospect of a remake somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Think about it: If you follow the original too closely, duplicating signature shots or lines of dialogue or acting flourishes, then you're stuck in a mode of mindless imitation — and what's the point of that? People might as well just watch the great version they already know (or, for new generations, have yet to discover). But if you seriously update the movie in question, making a lot of eyebrow-raising changes, then you risk violating the essence of the original — or leaving out too much of what everyone loved about it in the first place. When you get down to it, a ''new'' version of a classic is a contradiction in terms. Carrie, the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen King's first novel, is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without, perhaps, ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece. Yet I personally think it's a great film. There's nothing that compares to its glittery fusion of dreaminess and dread — of Cinderella-at-the-prom fantasy and blood-bucket horror, all mixed up with elements of '70s teensploitation comedy and primally entangled mother-daughter tragedy. And what acting! Sissy Spacek, as the squashed-nerd telekinetic high school wallflower Carrie, and Piper Laurie, as her ragingly repressed Evangelical mom, achieved a tremulous power together. And De Palma, a prankish virtuoso, perched the whole thing on the knife's edge between sincerity and satire. Carrie is a timeless movie because it's both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made.	1
The top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to Google on Wednesday, expressing "strong concerns" with the privacy policy the Web giant intends to roll out soon. "On a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by ersatz tracking that can be used to infer consumers' online behavior, and to infer their online activity, from non-personal information that consumers voluntarily provide to Google," the letter states.The letter, signed by 20 lawyers, asks Google for a "full explanation" of how the company defines what information the search giant can gather about consumers, including what information the company intends to collect and what information it wants to keep secret.The letter, which is addressed to Google's vice president of legal, Alvaro de la Garza, notes that the search giant has gone on a shopping spree, looking to bring a number of new features to the Web. "If you will, Google is becoming a real shopping mall with millions of products that consumers, as well as other online users, may find themselves 'tempted' to use," de la Garza wrote.In essence, Google is trying to determine what kind of information it can gather about a consumer through search, and then how it can use that data to make money or otherwise build up a profile about a person. In a world that can now monitor a person in real time, a consumer's "online behavior," for example, could be seen as a kind of "digital footprint," with the data used to build up a profile of where a person goes online, what kind of products they browse, where they travel, what their friends buy, and so on.A Consumer Alert issued last week by the Consumer Federation of America echoes the concerns of the letter, warning that Google is "expanding its data collection by expanding its data sharing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission."The letter from Google comes as more of us are sharing our online activity with online services like Google, Facebook, Yahoo and others. If a company like Google is able to gain valuable information about your shopping habits or political opinions (which a lot of us consider our most personal information), it could make it easier for marketers to target you online, or better position you to receive targeted marketing.The letter, however, is not the first to warn Google of these concerns. A petition, initiated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation last July, has garnered over 600 signatures, and	0
(The Hollywood Reporter)It's official: AMC's "The Walking Dead" companion series has a title. Executive producer Robert Kirkman announced Friday that the companion series, which starts as a prequel to the original, will be Â¡Star TrekÂ!!!, the long-running sci-fi franchise, and AMC, which also produces "The Simpsons," has signed a five-year exclusive deal with series' producer, Kirkman and his Bad Robot Productions. Kirkman said the deal with Bad Robot Productions includes a commitment from AMC to produce eight new episodes of the series. The announcement came as a surprise after Kirkman told THR that he had no plans for the series until he'd announced its new title. "I didn't want to announce anything," he said. "I don't want to be the guy who says, 'Here's the show,' before it has a title." Bad Robot Productions' president, Dana Goldberg and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Drew Goddard, will create the series. Kirkman, who is also executive producer on "Doctor Who," said he saw an opportunity with "Star Trek" as an ideal partner for his new project. "Because it's a shared universe, and because it's a long-running show, I thought, 'Let's do this,'" he said. According to AMC's press release, the series will follow Kirkman's characters as they learn about the "origin of the Enterprise," learn about the past lives of the actors who played them, see how they're preparing themselves for the show's return, and find out how long they have left to live on. For his part, Kirkman is thrilled with the announcement and hopes the series will help revive interest in Star Trek, which he said is in decline. "I just wanted to do something with a brand that people cared about, and I thought of 'Star Trek' a while ago as the perfect opportunity at the perfect time," he said. "I think it's really exciting." Kirkman's involvement in "Star Trek" was first announced in November 2013, when he announced he was bringing back his original "Star Trek" franchise for a new animated series for Sony Pictures Animation. The project was first announced in June 2014, when it was revealed that the series would be part of a new animated franchise under the umbrella of CBS/Sony Entertainment Television. The studio had said at the time that the first season of the series would consist of 11 episodes and be released	0
A major nor'easter is expected to bring blizzard conditions to interior New England and heavy rain and near-hurricane-force wind gusts to Northeastern coastal areas Wednesday through Friday. Little, if any, snow will fall in Boston, Massachusetts, while Washington, New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could see as much as 5 inches of snow with locally higher amounts, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Record snowfall totals of 30 inches or more will be possible across upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, Morris said. Very strong winds will combine with the heavy snow to produce dangerous white-out conditions and widespread power outages. Share your winter weather videos and pics Hurricane-force wind gusts combined with heavy rain are likely to cause significant flight delays and cancellations at all major airports along the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Friday, Morris said. Another storm was bringing heavy, wet snow Wednesday morning from Connecticut to Massachusetts. The National Weather Service predicted the weight of the snow would bring down tree limbs and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Scattered outages already were being reported in parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where snowfall totals in the Berkshire Mountains could reach 24 inches by Wednesday night, the weather service said. Meanwhile, central Texas was digging out from up to 4 inches of snow after setting records with more than a foot less than two weeks ago. Sunshine was predicted for Wednesday, but CNN iReport contributor Robert Huntington of Austin, Texas, said the snow was falling hard in his neighborhood Tuesday. "[They're] really big flakes, I mean, unusually large flakes," he said. "It's Texas. Everything's bigger in Texas." CNN's Jim Kavanagh, Sean Morris and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.	1
It's described as the 'Everest of sailing' -- a testing 39000 nautical mile challenge that takes crews through some of the most perilous waters in the world. The Volvo Ocean Race is in its first weeks of competition, an adventure that will last nine months. At the beginning of this month, six crews set off on the first leg of the grueling race in Alicante, Spain. Their journey will take them across the globe via the ports of Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, ItajaÃ­, Miami, Lisbon, and Lorient -- eventually finishing in Galway, Ireland in July next year. It's predicted millions of people will flock to the shorelines when the boats enter the ports. The event's growing popularity is parallel to the increasing professionalism that surrounds the race, and shows just how much it has changed since it began 38 years ago. "Our main concern was survival in the first race," says Alec Honey, who competed in 1973-74, when the event begun. It was known as The Whitbred Round the World Race and featured 17 yachts competing on what was then a 27,000 mile contest. Although the course was shorter, the journey was much slower and meant that sailors spent a lot more time at sea. Then the crew's comfort was considered. There was space for sailors to play cards during the down times and guitars were brought on board for night time sing-a-longs. Erik Pascoli, who skippered 'Tauranga' in 1973-74, remembers how on some yachts crates of beer were even included in the supplies so the sailors could enjoy a drink. "I remember the way the boats were loaded with pallets of beers when in other circumstances even an extra roll of toilet paper would have been a scandal." In modern racing, speed is the driving force behind every design decision. The record for the fastest day was set in 2008, when the Ericsson 4 traveled 687 miles in 24 hours. In the early days of the race's history, 200 miles was considered a very good day. But while it may have been slower, in 1973 the crews relied on their wits for survival. There was no satellite information -- the first they knew of a storm was when they were in it.	1
The retrial of Egypt's former president, Hosni Mubarak, on charges of killing protesters during the country's 2011 revolution and profiteering resumed Saturday before being adjourned until next June.Tanks and barricades surround the court building as thousands of supporters of Islamist groups protested outside, chanting, "the truth has come out," and "the people will not be afraid," although they have made little progress on the case.Mubarak, 81, was acquitted on July 22 by the first trial, but he faces a second one set to begin on Nov. 8 in which he could again be convicted.The revolution that ousted Mubarak started peacefully, but quickly escalated into a wave of demonstrations that turned deadly.Protesters were crushed by police, military tanks and even helicopters, and many were killed.Many of those killed in June and July 2011 were young men, and some were reportedly shot at close range.The former president and his ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (scaf) are accused under a law that makes it a felony to cause death or injury to civilians.Protesters who had been demanding his trial on those charges for over two years now have little hope because a military-backed panel that sentenced Mubarak to life imprisonment with a $1 billion fine earlier this month said his trial on a new charge of corruption will not begin in June despite the law requiring it.The panel met to decide the case, and had ordered the retrial after one of its members, army Colonel Mohamed Tantawi, quit last month over the panel's decision, according to the state-run Nile News, which has not published the report.In a phone call before Saturday's verdicts began, a government spokesman said the panel "decided to ask the defense minister to announce a new date for the trial," though he did not elaborate.The panel meeting was attended by Tantawi as well as military chief of staff Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and a number of army chief of staff Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and some other officers.The panel said it had held a meeting with the defense minister, Gen. Tarek al-Shara, "who expressed his readiness to announce a new date for the trial, which he is ready to do within six days of the new date."However, in the first trial, Tant	0
For the Dawsons of Tauranga, New Zealand, the canoe slalom event at the London Olympics will be a family affair. Mike Dawson, who is competing in the men's kayak class, will not just be trying to impress his father, who coaches him, or his brother and sister, who will be watching from the crowd. He will also need to ensure he doesn't incur the disapproval of his mother, Kay, who is one of the judges at the event. The idea of a mother officiating in a competition in which her son is participating may strike some as a little unfair, but the Dawsons and the New Zealand Canoe Federation are eager to stress there's no scope for special treatment in this case. "The only real advantage mum can give me is her presence at what will be my biggest race ever," said Mike Dawson, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time after finishing 16th in the canoe slalom world championships in Slovakia last year. The event involves the kayakers flinging themselves down a steep course of white-water rapids, weaving through a series of gates like slalom skiers in a race against the clock. If the competitors touch or miss a gate, they suffer a time penalty. Each gate has a judge watching out for errors, and a chief official oversees the entire course. As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side. Competitors' runs are reviewed on video, and the chief official has the final say. "I can't envisage any way a single gate judge could influence the outcome for any athlete," said Maree Burnett, the secretary general of the New Zealand Canoe Federation. "Kay is a very experienced international judge." The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees. In the past few years, Kay Dawson has officiated at canoe slalom world championships and world cups in which her 25-year-old son has raced. The ICF has "a strong officiating process in place to ensure accuracy and fairness at all its competitions, whether it is at world cups, world championships or at the Olympic Games," said Lerina Bright, a spokeswoman for the federation. She noted that some judges at the event have the same nationality as some competitors.	1
Rafael Nadal suffered only his third defeat in 11 years at the Monte Carlo Masters Friday losing in straight sets to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer. The 32-year-old Ferrer produced a typically energetic urn performance in the contest, which marked his second straight tournament victory in Monte Carlo.Ferrer also came through an emotional, two-hour ceremony in front of the tournament and the courtside crowd after a late injury loss to the much maligned Spaniard in the clay-court tournament a week ago. Ferrer said he had to go through some emotional and mental adjustments because of the match loss and had to “cope,” but ultimately found that he needed to “be tough.”“I need to be tough,” Ferrer said. “I couldn’t play bad in the match yesterday, I couldn’t sleep. It was just mental.”Nadal did not play especially well on clay this season with a string of poor results, going 10-11 in his last 17 clay-court matches.But if Nadal had not been able to produce a string of consistent results on clay, none of the other four ranked men would have been at the tournament. Nadal was a very long shot to win the event without at least one of the other top players.Also in the early going, Swiss legend Roger Federer had a relatively mediocre run at winning the Monte Carlo event. But the 32-year-old Federer, winner of the last five titles, played a very good match and a very good tournament. The Swiss legend produced his first clay-court tournament victory since he upset then world number one Rafael Nadal in the 2009 French Open. Federer came through an emotional three-hour ceremony, saying he was so happy he could be “in heaven.”“I think it was just some nerves and stuff,” Federer said. “I was getting up very early and I was probably being a little bit anxious. But it can happen to any of us.”Federer faced a tough choice as to how he wanted to play in the final. He could either play a good match or a bad match. Either way, Federer said it would be a good tournament for him.“I would be extremely excited to have the opportunity to do that,�	0
Despite a miracle shot to join a four-man playoff, Rory McIlroy ultimately was left to rue his failure to negotiate the notorious Bear Trap at PGA National as Russell Henley claimed the Honda Classic title Sunday. Looking to lead from start to finish, McIlroy endured a wayward final round 74 but after brilliantly scrambling a par three on the 15th still held the lead at 10-under-par. An ugly double bogey at the 16th after he found the water and a bogey four on the par-3 17th then all but ended his chances. The former world number one appeared to need an eagle three on the par-5 to rekindle his victory hopes and from 245 yards hit an approach of laser-like accuracy over the water and to within 10 feet of the flag. Playing partner Henley fluffed his chance to make a birdie four to get to nine under and McIlroy saw his eagle putt slide agonizingly wide. It left the pair tied at eight-under 272 with earlier finishers Russel Knox of Scotland and American Ryan Palmer, who had missed a short par putt on the 18th, which would have given him outright victory. Four-man playoff Playing the 18th again as the first extra hole, McIlroy attempted to repeat his earlier approach shot but his effort went long and into the back bunker. He failed to get down in two shots and with Knox and Palmer also having to settle for par fives, it left Henley a short putt to seal his second PGA Tour victory with a birdie four. McIlroy, searching for his first win of the year after near misses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, held a two-shot lead over Henley after starting the day on 12-under. Wayward play saw shots dribble away before he hit the three-hole Bear Trap from 15th to the 17th, designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus. Henley, who had chipped in to join McIlroy at 10-under on the 14th, made a hash of the short 15th himself, finding the water with his tee shot to make a double bogey. But he kept his nerve the better in the final analysis to land the $6 million PGA Tour event. "I was fortunate that I was in the playoff," McIlroy said. "I didn't play well enough at all down the stretch to win this tournament."	1
Roger Ebert was seldom at a loss for words. His debates with Gene Siskel, his longtime co-host on a succession of movie-review television shows, sometimes seemed to start before the introduction and often  lasted throughout the discussion. "My name is Gene Siskel, and I'm going to ask you a tough question that will keep you thinking for a long time. . . . If we had the time to listen to one more round of questions, we would," he said.So there was something in him that allowed him to keep the audience of the Chicago Tribune, which asked him to give his own answer to some tough tough questions, thinking through them in detail until he was ready for the next round. It was a talent that served him well in his long career as a movie and television critic, and for decades it helped him maintain the focus he wanted to give to his daily writing on these subjects.But it was a talent that was increasingly challenged by events that took him away from the Tribune, in the early 1980s, and beyond.It started on Wednesday, December 8, 1984, the day after the second anniversary of his return to film criticism following his first and last days as film critic at the Chicago Tribune.I had known Ebert well for many years and had enjoyed his friendship. So when I first met him, he had just returned from a two-year sabbatical, from a new job as movie critic for The Washington Post, which, with him, was one of the oldest national papers in the country. He had started as a movie critic at the Chicago Sun-Times in 1941, and then, after it merged with the Chicago Tribune in 1955, he had written his first column while serving as film critic at the Tribune. He retired in 1976, but remained a contributing editor for the Tribune until his death on December 4, 2010.By the end of 1984, Ebert had been asked by the paper to return for a year to cover the film that was being made in his hometown, and which would be his last assignment. I first met him when he came to my house to give me his annual Christmas wish list.One year later in December 1986, Ebert turned down the job. When I asked him why, he said simply, "I want to be a movie critic.""You just made a big decision," I said. He said he didn	0
The U.S. Coast Guard on  Thursday found an additional two bodies of crew members missing after  a freighter crashed into the hull of a smaller vessel at the mouth of the Hormugabal Lake in southwestern Alaska.The Coast Guard said in a statement on its website the crew of the Ocean Guardian had been in the air about 90 mph for 30 minutes before the impact."The Coast Guard believes the incident is caused by mechanical failure," the statement said. "The Ocean Guardian and the barge are both reported to have sunk. We have secured the scene and the Coast Guard is awaiting search and rescue," the statement added.The Coast Guard said it is awaiting a third call to determine if any other bodies were recovered. The crew aboard the Ocean Guardian is now being taken to Ketchikan with the Coast Guard assisting in recovering the bodies.The captain of Ocean Guardian died in the accident, officials said. The Ocean Guardian is about 100 feet long and is operated by Alaska Marine Lines.The Coast Guard said the Coast Guard and Alaska Marine Lines are continuing rescue efforts at sea and working with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Hormugabal Alaska Navigation Association to continue search and rescue efforts.Earlier in the day, the Coast Guard said the Ocean Guardian and its smaller ship, the M/V Nodina, both are reported to have sunk and the area is now being secured.The Coast Guard is also in contact with numerous witnesses who have reported seeing vessels that appeared to be out of control. The Coast Guard confirmed one witness was aboard the Ocean Guardian when it was involved in an accident.The Coast Guard said more details about the accident will be released later on Thursday afternoon.The Coast Guard said one person aboard Ocean Guardian was transported to Ketchikan and two persons aboard the M/V Nodina were transported to Ketchikan.The Hormugabal Alaska Navigation Association is assisting in the search and rescue efforts.The Coast Guard said it does not believe any oil had leaked or spilled before the accident.The Alaska State Troopers are investigating the accident and the Coast Guard is assisting."The Coast Guard is committed to the safety of its crews, and we will continue to work with all agencies involved to ensure that the safety of our personnel is our top priority," Coast Guard Adm.

American journalist James Foley was murdered, beheaded by an English-speaking member of ISIS, the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State and has already conquered large swaths of two Middle Eastern countries. The ersatz-U.S. government in charge would like to hold that person responsible and claim he deserved to die because he made "provocative comments" while videotaped inside the terrorist’s compound.While there’s no evidence that Foley deserved to die, the U.S. and its allies have been pushing a narrative that his death was an “act of war.” In a statement released early in the investigation, the U.S. government sought to blame the ISIS execution of Foley on a British journalist for Al Jazeera and said the murder was “not an act of terrorism.” In other words, we’re going to claim that Foley didn’t do any wrong for reasons that can’t possibly be just.But when I first heard this theory, I thought, This is ridiculous.Foley was killed by a member of ISIS’s security force, not by an Islamist fighter with a pistol. The U.S. government’s claims are based on a debunked claim made by British journalist James Foley — a man who said he had been subjected to “brutal and sustained” interrogation for over three months. He was never held by ISIS and was never an eyewitness to any terrorist activity in Iraq.Foley was tortured after being abducted from the Philippines and held in a Turkish prison for three months. Foley was not interviewed by journalists or intelligence agencies in the weeks prior to his arrest or in 2014 when he was first reported as being held by ISIS, and only learned of his captivity after his death. He was told he had been killed by ISIS and that video would be released by ISIS. Since then, we’ve learned that Foley was not actually killed by ISIS, but rather they released a video that is a mixture of Foley’s beheading and the beheaded remains of other victims, as well as propaganda footage.“I wish to express my gratitude to James Foley for his courage and commitment to freedom,” the statement from the U.S. government said, ignoring Foley’s lack of involvement with ISIS or terrorism. “The world is now a safer place in which to live, because	0
After back-to-back stomach clutching renditions of "Not Gon' Cry" and "I'm Going Down" at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans Sunday night, Mary J. Blige pulled off an Oprah-worthy seminar on icky celebrity.After pulling off a high-drama interview with Oprah Winfrey in New Orleans, Mary J. Blige sat down with CNN anchor Gloria Borger and talked about how she's handling the news that her husband, Nicki Minaj, is about to become a star after her breakout single "Starships" hit.Mary J. Blige, who in this interview was asked about her relationship with Nicki Minaj, explained that their romance didn't seem like it was going anywhere."The fact that she had us together, and Nicki said she wasn't going anywhere," Blige said. "She said I was on her arm."She also talked about how she dealt with the fallout of Nicki’s first #1 hit “Starships,” and how that song turned the whole relationship into a "silly" thing."I was going to the studio the next day," she said. "She was, like, 'I'm not going. I'm going to be late,' and it was like, 'Wow, Nicki's going to be late. But she's going to be on her way and if you don't text her, she's going to figure it out. She's going to find out on the way.' And so I was, like, 'Dang, okay. No. I'm going to text her now.' And she was getting on the bus. And I was, like, 'Nope. I'm not texting her now.' And I was going to text her the next day, and I don't text her."She continued, "So it just came up, like, that the relationship was going to be a silly relationship, and so it was very silly, and that was really funny to me. I was like, 'No. The relationship is not a silly relationship,'" she said. "'Starships' was a silly song. It was a, it was a silly song, and we had to fight for it, and we always do."So then she was asked about the other, more famous members of the group, including Ariana Grande and Meghan	0
Pakistan's former cricket star turned politician, Imran Khan, has returned home after hospital treatment for injuries suffered in a dramatic fall two weeks ago, he said Â– but failed to elaborate on how he escaped serious head injuries.Khan, who had been in hospital since then, said he had been able to walk as of late February and would return home on Friday Â– but did not give details of exactly where he had been.He said he would return to political work Â– but not to become prime minister Â– and would make a public announcement of his return. “I will announce my return to work,” he said. “It will be a matter of time,” he told AFP before flying back to his hometown of Liaquatabad, the capital of the predominantly Pashtun tribal area of Kharan, near Multan.He added: “There are many things I have not spoken about that people do not know even today.”Khan was injured when he fell from a hotel balcony in Islamabad, which he had been spending the winter months in from Pakistan’s December election. He said he had no intention of pursuing a political career beyond his parliamentary term and wanted to spend his time with his family.He had been treated in Pakistan’s Supreme Court, where he was granted bail, but had yet to publicly announce his return.The fall from the hotel balcony in question caused a laceration to his head and left him with a broken pelvis when he landed on the concrete below.It also injured his foot, he said, and he was expected to have an operation on the ankle to treat the injury.When asked about his injuries, Khan said he had “no pain” and added that “he had been suffering from insomnia and depression” after being the only child of a wealthy landowner and a medical doctor whose family owned a private hospital and a successful pharmaceutical company.“My father left home when I was just a child and my mother followed him,” he said.After he graduated from medical school, Khan began practising medicine in Peshawar and Khairpur, Punjab. He eventually opened his own private practice there.He took a break to work for Pakistan Television in 1978, when he was 23. There, he was part of the team	0
Editor's note: Jane Velez-Mitchell hosts "Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell," a topical event-driven show with a wide range of viewpoints that airs every night at 7 p.m. ET on HLN. New York (HLN) -- It's racing season in America! The Kentucky Derby is this weekend. Then it's the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. Get out the fancy party hats and pop the champagne! But it's not a cause for celebration for America's horses. These magnificent, yet voiceless, creatures cannot tell you about the exploitation underlying America's racing industry. Where do thoroughbreds go after they lose one too many races, throw one too many riders or develop a limp? Many thousands of thoroughbreds end up being slaughtered for horse meat. The unpleasant truth is horse meat is eaten in Europe and Asia. Despite the myth that they end up knee-deep in grass on some idyllic farm, the reality is that horses are very expensive to keep. When they outlive their usefulness, they often are sent on a hellish journey that ends in a slaughterhouse. Toward the end of the line, these horses are sold priced per pound. I know. I've bought perfectly healthy horses for a couple of hundred dollars just as they were about to be loaded on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. The fortunate few end up at a sanctuary. The others are bought at auction, end up in overloaded trailers and travel thousands of miles without food or water to the slaughter plant. Some are dead on arrival. According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), tens of thousands of live horses are transported every year across the border to slaughterhouses in Mexico and Canada. Part of the problem is that the horse racing industry breeds for perfection. For every stallion or mare that looks like a winner, an untold number of foals get left in the dust. As the saying goes, they can't all be winners ... and they can't all be riding or school horses either. There is a severe horse overpopulation crisis caused by overbreeding in the racing industry. It's time for that industry to accept responsibility for its castoffs and take dramatic action to protect a species that has so loyally served humankind. They've got the money to create enough retirement homes to accommodate all the horses that pass through their gates.	1
Q: I was shocked to read in the news that children as young as 7 are hurting themselves. Why would they do that? A: I'm often surprised by what surprises people. This study, recently published in the journal Pediatrics, has garnered tremendous media attention. The study found that approximately 8% of third-grade students had at some point in their lives engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. Examples of non-suicidal self-injury include hitting oneself, burning oneself, cutting or carving the skin and inserting sharp objects into the skin. Although it is extremely distressing that children engage in these types of behavior, I don't find it surprising it all. Three other things surprise me a good deal more. First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults. Why would we expect that non-suicidal self-injury would wait for puberty to make an appearance? We already know that certain genetic mutations, for example the mutation that causes Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, can produce horrific self-mutilating behavior in even very young children. While people report engaging in non-suicidal self-injury for various reasons, almost always, they hurt themselves in response to stressful situations or negative emotions. Anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults. If a minority of adults responds to powerful emotions by harming themselves, why should children not do the same? This leads directly to the second thing that surprises me: that children below the age of puberty are considerably less likely to deliberately harm themselves than are adolescents or young adults. This finding is consistent with a lot of literature showing that children have far lower rates of mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders than adults do. This fact is often taken for granted in the mental health world, but it is really quite remarkable and not well-understood. After all, children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry. Moreover, it is now very clear that childhood experiences are the strongest environmental determinants of developing mental illness as an adult. So why the delay? If the stresses and strains of childhood light the fuse for psychiatric illness, why does it take so long for the fuse to burn? I could fill pages with various theories, but I can't give a one- or two-sentence answer that encapsulates this unquestionable truth.	1
It's the business buzzword that's helping to change the global economy: Start-up. But in Berlin, the start-up world is still shaping up. Simon Schaefer is the founder of Factory, a 16,000-square-meter co-working space in Berlin designed to cultivate entrepreneurship. Factory allows small start-ups to work on the same campus as more established tech companies, providing a "playground for entrepreneurs and innovators." CNN spoke with Schaefer to find out how Factory is facilitating start-ups and the burgeoning Berlin tech scene. CNN: How many start-ups are currently working at Factory? Simon Schaefer: Right now we have about 25 companies here on the premises. The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to. CNN: How does Berlin's start-up environment compare to the likes of Silicon Valley? SS: If you compare Berlin to other ecosystems, it's very early stage.  And it needs time the most, and collective know-how.  And getting companies from different stages and having them work with each other is much, much easier with proximity and bringing people together in one place. CNN: What advice do you have for others who are starting a business? SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.  If you're an angel or seed-stage, it's rather simple. You get feedback on your product and you get the chance to test your ideas with your peers. If you're in a later stage company, I think you quickly realize that growth changes you. And so I think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early-stage companies, but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago.  I think it's always important to have that visually in front of you, to be aware of what it really means to be a small, flexible team. CNN: Why did you choose to invest in start-ups?	1
President Barack Obama should use the breathing space provided by the fiscal-cliff compromise to address some of the issues that he shelved during his last term. One of the most urgent is child farm labor. Perhaps the least protected,  most vulnerable, workers are children. Yet despite the high costs, in part because of the difficulty of tracking them, the president has had difficulty acknowledging that child labor is a genuine crisis.Since the 1970s, we have tolerated the worst forms of child labor in agriculture, and today children are disproportionately represented in agriculture’s hazardous work environments. The fact that so many of these children, some as young as nine years old, are exploited in California’s orange groves is particularly troubling. And yet this is not the first time the agricultural industry has faced the scrutiny of the public.The question of child labor is a complicated one, because many of the issues are too easily characterized as “unfair trade.” Trade, in fact, has had many positive effects for children and families, as research shows. But the simple answer is a trade’s “fairness,” and how trade has been conducted over the last century has had, to say the least, a dark side.So-called child labor is a complex phenomenon that can occur in many contexts. There is an important distinction between the child who is doing hard labor for pay and the child who is being subjected to poverty and danger. It is important to recognize the difference between these two, and to separate the two cases, but it is also important to recognize the broader definition of “child labor.” And in our country, child labor has been used to justify both bad trade policy and laws that are inconsistent with basic humanitarian and labor laws.A child is not necessarily protected by either the federal Constitution or international law. In fact, that child could be, by extension, an exploited child. It is, in fact, quite possible that the child was not even born in a workplace and that she was exploited from a very young age. The question of exploitation is also problematic because it is possible that a child may be exploited by a parent. For instance, there is a compelling case to be made that the father of a child who has been forced to work under harsh conditions could have also caused the child’s exploitation. The child’s father is not protected by the Constitution, but he is	0

In the early morning hours Saturday, surviving remnants of a NASA satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere over a remote stretch of the southern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. space agency said Tuesday. Nick Johnson, NASA's chief scientist for orbital debris, said on the agency's website that the re-entry point was in the general vicinity of Christmas Island, south of Indonesia. "It's unlikely that anyone actually observed the re-entry," Johnson said, adding that NASA has yet to receive any reports of a sighting from airplanes, ships or island inhabitants in the region. A NASA statement on the website, labeled the final status report on the falling satellite, said it entered the atmosphere at 0400 GMT Saturday, midnight on the U.S. East Coast, over "a broad, remote ocean area in the Southern Hemisphere." The exact coordinates cited by NASA were 14.1 degrees south latitude and 189.8 degrees east longitude (170.2 west longitude). According to the statement, debris would have landed 300 to 800 miles northeast of the re-entry point. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite was launched in 1991 on a space shuttle mission and ceased its scientific life in 2005, the NASA statement said. It broke into pieces during re-entry, NASA said, with 26 chunks weighing a total of 1,200 pounds considered likely to reach the Earth's surface. According to NASA, space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year.	1
In 1985, Meng Weina set up China's first private special needs school in the southern city of Guangzhou. As a single mother she was motivated to help those who are often overlooked by the  more well-off. Over the following years she grew the school into a large, thriving institution providing a variety of services to its growing clientele: the working class, single parents, ex-convicts, the disenchanted, and people who live in rural areas. More than a charity, the school aims to become an equal of a Western school, providing education without the strictness, rules and uniforms that come with the institutionalisation of the state-school model.In a study on the impact of special needs schools by the Harvard psychologist Robert Kegan, special schools are often characterised as a 'third way' solution to social problems in the Western world – a way of providing an alternative to institutionalisation and school reform. However, in China such schools are seen more as a vehicle for social change, albeit an incremental one: as Kegan put it, 'The more you pay for schooling, the more you make it.' In China many of these new, progressive schools have been staffed only by volunteers. They have been based on the traditional model of a single-room schoolhouse. 'The teachers are not specialists in the subject,' said one of the school's founders. 'They are ordinary people with normal jobs. They just believe as much as we do and share as much as we do.'### 'Grow rich or die'Special schools are not necessarily radical in their aims or their methods. They may provide a more inclusive, flexible education than other options. They have been criticised for being too slow to change the rigid and bureaucratic structures of the public schools. The public schools are often called 'left' or 'right' schools. A left-wing critic called for a 'third way' school system (a compromise between the public and the private) because there was no single 'correct' school system. A right-wing critic, the sociologist Edward Thompson, wrote that to 'grow rich or die', the children of the Western elite, the 'bourgeois', 'and the intellectuals' had to be educated in the state-run schools: 'In this age of education, it is increasingly necessary to make use of the state as a schoolmaster for the children of the educated.'This was the reasoning behind the establishment	0

A rare combination of angelic delicacy and extraordinary power, Art Garfunkel's voice has lent reverie and wonder to songs for nearly  more than three decades."There is nothing more soothing, more calming or more serene than a song by Art Garfunkel," says Richard Rodgers, who wrote the classic song "The Old Rugged Cross." "His voice is always sweet and he sings with a kind of feeling and power — not overcharged, but in such a beautiful way — that you want to put your life in his hands."Art's mother, Ruth, was a gospel singer and his father, Fred, founded the first gospel radio in Detroit. Raised in the gospel tradition, Art had a deep reverence for spiritual truths. "I grew up singing hymns, and the Bible, like a parrot," he says. "My music wasn't always about words. I was into rhythm — the kind of drum music people call 'the blues.'"Garfunkel was an early child prodigy who was given a $10 guitar by the Ford Foundation when he was 12. He quickly moved to New York, where he worked as a backup singer at the age of 14. There, he met David Lindley, who was a young record producer with Columbia Records. "He was the only fellow I met who knew that I had a gift. I never expected to do anything in music, much less be successful," Garfunkel says.After a three-year tour with the Beatles, Garfunkel got a part in the film, "The Miracle Worker," and the following year he moved to Los Angeles. He signed with Columbia Records' parent company, RCA Victor, and in 1965 he made his first major hit with "The Way We Were," which reached No. 2 on the R&B charts and No. 1 on the pop charts."I think it was love for Ruth that I was singing about," says Garfunkel, who was married at the time. "I thought about our life together, about the time she took me from my mother and I was three months old.""I was trying to have a happy, child-rearing marriage, and I sang about it. I was working a lot and was still singing in church, and I couldn't really do anything about it, except tell everybody that I was in love with her.""The Way	0
Thousands of children in England have been sexually exploited by gangs or groups of men or are at high risk of sexual exploitation, according to a report released Wednesday. The report, which calls for urgent action to protect young people, comes amid wide public concern prompted by revelations of child abuse by a former BBC TV presenter, Jimmy Savile.

The death toll in a Moscow metro derailment Tuesday has reached 22, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. Another 160 people are injured, of whom more than 120 were hospitalized, the Moscow health care department said. Of those, a few dozen were in critical condition. The derailment took place during morning rush hour in the Russian capital. Three metro train cars derailed in a tunnel, the state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200 people were evacuated, the Emergency Ministry said on its website. Dozens of ambulances arrived at the scene, along with three helicopters, to help shuttle the injured to hospitals, ITAR-Tass said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin declared Wednesday as a day of mourning. The cause is under investigation It was not clear what caused the derailment, but the head of Moscow's Transportation Department said it was not a terrorist attack. However, it's still subject to a criminal investigation as authorities seek to find out what's behind the crash. In the moments afterward, many of those caught up in the derailment scrambled back up to the surface at the station west of central Moscow, some bleeding and dazed as they emerged. The rescue operation had become a recovery operation by Tuesday afternoon as emergency workers sought to free the remaining bodies from within the mangled train cars. Their efforts were made more difficult by the depth of Moscow's metro lines, on which roughly 11 million people travel daily. The metro system -- the backbone of the city's public transit network -- has been the target of past terror attacks.

Years before Jerry Sandusky was charged with child sexual abuse, a psychologist told Penn State police in 1998 that the former assistant football coach acted the way a pedophile might. In her assessment, Alycia Chambers described her involvement in a case in which the mother of a young boy reported that Sandusky had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate contact with him. A redacted version of that evaluation was published Saturday by NBC News. "My consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions, based on experience and education, of a likely pedophile's pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch, within a context of a 'loving,' 'special' relationship," Chambers wrote. The assessment could be significant because it suggests the university was warned about Sandusky, in no uncertain terms, as early as 1998, but did not stop the alleged abuse. Sandusky, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial on more than 50 counts of child sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. Former school officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation. In addition to Chambers' evaluation, NBC News released a 1998 campus police report tied to the same sexual misconduct allegations against Sandusky. It described a second evaluation conducted by John Seasock, identified as another psychologist. Like Chambers, he spoke to the child in question about what transpired between him and Sandusky. He went into the interview cold, and reported he found no indication of child abuse. "Seasock said that he hadn't heard of a 52-year-old becoming a pedophile," the report read. In an e-mail to CNN, Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general, declined comment on the 1998 assessment and differing opinions. Penn State rejected a CNN public records request for a copy of the 1998 police report in December. Amy Elizabeth McCall, an assistant general counsel, asserted in a letter to CNN then that Penn State is "a state-related institution" and not a "state school" like some in other states, and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions. "Because the 1998 investigation did not result in any criminal charges, it is not criminal history information and the university's police are thus required by law to keep that information within the police department," McCall wrote.	1
A top Israeli official on Sunday criticized a new statement from Catholic bishops on the Middle East and blasted the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who spearheaded the statement as "libel." On Saturday, Catholic bishops from the Middle East concluded a two-week conference in Rome, Italy, with a call for the international community, especially the United Nations, to work "to put an end to the occupation" of Palestinian territories. On Sunday, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon criticized that concluding statement of the conference, called a synod. "We express our disappointment that this important synod has become a forum for political attacks on Israel in the best history of Arab propaganda," Ayalon said in a statement. "The synod was hijacked by an anti-Israel majority." Ayalon singled out the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who said at the conference that Israel is not the Jews' promised land. "We Christians cannot speak of the 'promised land' as an exclusive right for a privileged Jewish people," Archbishop Cyril Salim Bustros, who leads the Greek Melkite Church in the U.S., said at the conference's final press conference on Saturday. "This promise was nullified by Christ." "There is no longer a chosen people -- all men and women of all countries have become the chosen people," Bustros said. On Sunday, Israel's Ayalon said that "We are especially appalled at the language used by Archbishop Bustros during his press conference." Bustros led the committee that drafted the synod's concluding statement on Israel and the Palestinians. "We call on the Vatican to distant themselves from Archbishop Boutros' comments which are a libel against the Jewish People and the State of Israel and should not be construed as the Vatican's official position," Ayalon said in his statement.  "These outrageous comments should not cast a shadow over the important relationship between the Vatican, the state of Israel and the Jewish people." The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, praised the synod and echoed Bustros' remarks. "Israel cannot use the biblical concept of a promised land or chosen people to justify new settlements in Jerusalem or Israeli territorial claims," Saeb Erakat, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a chief palestinian negotiator, said in a statement Sunday. Erakat said the synod sent "a clear a message to the government of Israel that it may not claim that Jerusalem is an exclusively Israeli city."	1
John Hinckley Jr.'s relationships with women and his difficulties becoming part of a community away from a government mental hospital were spotlighted Thursday during a hearing to discuss whether the man who tried to kill President Ronald Reagan will eventually be allowed to live as an outpatient. An official at St. Elizabeths Hospital, where Hinckley, 56, has lived for decades after being found not guilty by reason of insanity, said Hinckley had been engaged to a former patient he met at the hospital. She was identified only as "Miss CB," but the engagement recently ended. Dr. Tyler Jones, the facility's director of psychiatry, said Hinckley had given the woman "multiple rings." Jones said Hinckley had told him he'd explained to CB he planned to spend more time visiting his mother's home in Virginia and would be spending less time with her. As a result of that conversation, "she's withdrawn the physical affection that they shared," Jones said. Federal prosecutor Colleen Kennedy also questioned Jones about Hinckley's past relationship with a patient identified as "Miss X." Kennedy said Hinckley had difficulty communicating with the woman because she was so psychotic, but he pursued the relationship because she was physically affectionate. Jones described Hinckley's actions as "poor judgment" motivated by his "desire for affection." According to Jones, another doctor told Hinckley the relationship was ill-advised and eventually Hinckley ended it. Hinckley has been spending 10 days a month visiting his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he works part time as a volunteer in the library at Eastern State Hospital, a mental health facility. Doctors have been encouraging him to make friends in Williamsburg and build a new life. Jones said Hinckley has had some difficulties. In one instance, he followed a suggestion to go to a singles group, but that did not turn out well. "He was asked to leave," said Jones, because one participant was very uncomfortable with his presence. Since Hinckley likes music and plays the guitar, one of his doctors suggested he go play for hospice patients. But Jones said Hinckley never went because the hospice was worried there might be negative publicity if the presidential assailant played there.	1

GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich got a good laugh from his audience of conservatives Friday when he ribbed the U.S. government for not using mail services, such as FedEx, to track down the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in America.“Let me ask you a question that you probably didn’t hear and maybe that you didn’t anticipate,” Gingrich said at a forum in the South Carolina town of Greenville.“Why doesn’t the Internal Revenue Service use FedEx to track down the 11 million Americans who are undocumented in America?” Gingrich joked, to a round of applause.The audience laughed. “I thought we were going to use FedEx,” a woman in the audience said afterwards.Gingrich said he was talking about the fact that the IRS does not have a system to track down undocumented immigrants with addresses that are unreadable in public records, such as addresses in the garbage or the trash bin.“That’s what we’re talking about,” Gingrich said. “I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”“You’re not tracking down 12 million people,” one woman in the audience scoffed.“Yes, well, of course, the IRS doesn’t track down 11 million people,” he responded. “The IRS tracks down one, and they are very good at it.“Look, the IRS only collects about 10 percent of what’s due from everyone who files a tax return,” said Gingrich. “It is not just the 12 million who are illegal but, in fact, all the rest of America.”But Gingrich was not quite satisfied with his answer. “I’m not talking about one person,” he said to a smattering of applause. “The same principle applies to the IRS. The IRS doesn’t do anything.”The audience laughed.“No, no, no, no,” he said. “Now, you probably don’t know this, but the IRS does actually make a great deal of money by filing people’s tax returns, by having taxpayers make their returns. But they have to.”	0
Reclusive author J.D. Salinger has emerged, at least in the pages of court documents, to try to stop a novel that presents Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen hero of his classic "The Catcher in the   Rye," as a darkly moralizing figure who can’t seem to make peace with his own life.The novelist wants to avoid being sued in California for defaming Caulfield, who has accused him of taking the story of a dead father and his disaffected son "out of context."The author's lawyers filed a motion on Monday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to stop an unpublished novel based on "Catcher in the   Rye" from being published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. The novel, scheduled to be released in October, is the work of Salinger's former editor, John Gunther. Salinger is said to have taken issue with the novel after reading it, as well as a later edition, in late 2004.Under the terms of the court filing, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt was asked to remove the material from its website by Jan. 21.In its motion, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is seeking to have the copyright removed from the book, as well as court papers that detail Salinger's complaint and "the nature of Mr. Caulfield’s claim which this filing anticipates."As part of the settlement, which must be approved by Salinger's attorney, Mark R. Levin, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has asked Salinger for an outline of the character depicted in the book.According to the motion, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will have until Feb. 21 to respond to the request.The lawsuit said the book is based on Caulfield’s description to writer Leonard (Lenny) Warshaw of his father's death, and the author’s personal experiences with his own father, who was a war veteran who left him a disinherited son.The suit said, "The book is entitled 'Catcher in the Rye,'" while the author is said to have complained about the depiction of his character."When I read it, I could not help but feel that I'm being read as a caricature," Salinger told a reporter in a	0
As you and your family look forward to countless holiday meals yet to come, the recently celebrated Antibiotic Awareness Week might have passed by unnoticed. Perhaps you've never heard of this global effort to bring attention to the increasing ills of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, an issue that has plagued our community for decades.Regardless of how you've spent the past few weeks, it's always important to educate yourself on the ever-increasing threat of antibiotic resistance, or simply "antibiotics," in our community.What Is Antibiotic Resistance?This term can be misleading, as antibiotic agents are both needed and used to treat infections. They include, but are not limited to, penicillin and methicillin, as well as other anti-bacterial agents that treat many different types of illnesses.Antibiotics are not a cure-all, but rather an important component of the treatment of infections. Antimicrobial therapy can cure some types of infection, such as Strep throat and acne. They can also help reduce the effects of a particular antibiotic, such as the use of penicillin to treat an ear infection.The problem is that the antibiotics used to treat so many different types of illnesses and conditions are becoming increasingly ineffective in treating a number of diseases. With the advent of resistant illnesses, the number of infections we need to treat is growing exponentially.How We Got HereAntibiotic resistance is an outcome of the very over-use of antibiotics. In order to help combat these growing problem, in 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) began the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine Initiative. HPV vaccines are the only type of preventive HPV vaccines that have been shown to prevent infection and lead to the eventual cessation of HPV-related cancers.This initiative was meant to help stop the spread and eventual death of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, it has played a key role in the increasing resistance of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. HPV is a virus that causes cervical cancer in women. Over the years, these infections have evolved to become more resistant to treatment with antibiotics.A major cause of this problem is the overuse of antibiotics, or use that comes with the overuse of antibiotics, that was caused by a lack of awareness. As early as 1982, the use of antibiotics in livestock was banned, as the use of anti-bacterial agents	0
A late Sergio Ramos goal earned Real Madrid a 2-1 win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Saturday as the La Liga leaders slumped to a second consecutive El Clasico defeat. Five days after being dumped out of the Copa del Mundo Cup in the last 16 by Real Sociedad, Madrid now face a tough time at Camp Nou. They are 3rd in Serie A and seven points behind city rivals Atlético de Madrid. After scoring in the 2-1 win over Valencia away, the game in Madrid was the 10th meeting between the sides in La Liga and the first of the season.MatchDetailsFirst HalfReal Madrid controlled the majority of the match. They pressed high up the pitch and took their chances while Barcelona struggled to get much in behind the home defense. Despite being down to 10 men after an off-the-ball foul from Sergio Ramos, Barcelona were the more dangerous side and had two chances. After Cristiano Ronaldo was taken off and Carlos Vela had to come on, Barça's pressure allowed them to take advantage of Real's mistake. With the keeper caught out by the first opportunity, Dani Carvajal played a beautiful through ball to Lionel Messi, who finished from close range for the first of the four goals.That gave Barcelona a 2-0 lead, but the game remained goalless before the break. At the end of the match, Barcelona were still on top of the table, just behind Real Madrid by one point and just 1 point ahead of Atlético Madrid.Second HalfAfter the break, Barcelona made an attempt to get a goal back from their penalty. Cesc Fàbregas was played in unmarked down the left wing, but made a poor decision to shoot and made only some contact with Gerard Piqué's crossbar. Barça continued to push hard but Real Madrid were able to equalize in the 68th minute.With the help of some excellent individual displays by Sergio Ramos and Sergio Busquets, the Spanish giants pulled level. Barça pushed up the pitch and Real Madrid were caught on a counter-attack. Sergio Ramos' corner found the head of Marcelo, who sent a curling effort into the bottom corner to give the home side a 3-2 lead.However, Barcelona pulled themselves together, winning their first in the La Liga for 14 years. It was a great	0
Mikhail Furtado was extremely worried about his 12th-grade exams. A few days before he was due to get his results, his father walked in and found him dead. "I opened the cottage door, put the light on and I found him hanging.  I was beside myself with tears and I just said: 'Dad, I can't fail. I'll take the exam tomorrow, and if one of my friends scores in the 90's, I'll cry for him, but if I even get a 90, it won't be enough. That's not enough. I'll pass, but I'll be ashamed,'" Furtado says."My parents were always very supportive. I wouldn't have had the courage to do it if they hadn't been, and I don't think I would have taken it, either. As far as I know, he wasn't depressed, but it's almost the same story: You're going to have a test tomorrow, you're going to try to do it, and if you fail, you're going to be ashamed and you're going to cry, but if you even get a 90, it's not going to be enough."In the weeks run-up to the exam the Furtado family got very little sleep and was in a constant state of alert."It was just a nightmare, it was horrible," he says. "At times I couldn't eat and I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming, because of my nerves."When we all went to the test, I had to go first and my parents were nervous but they supported me. It was a very hard situation. I'm still very angry with him. I still blame him. From the day he died, I've been very angry at him for not leaving me alone, to tell me to do my schoolwork."Furtado, now a senior at Queen Margaret University, says he still feels angry that his father didn't tell him his results until a couple of weeks after the due date. "I'm glad he was so worried, because I didn't let myself think about it," he says."But the worst part was, when I went to the school the day before the exam, there was a long queue and on the way to the exams I was so stressed, I didn't think about anything but my exam and my parents didn't tell	0
Six months after a passenger ferry sank off the coast of South Korea, a victim's body was discovered inside the wreckage on Tuesday. The body was found on the fourth floor in the women's bathroom, located at the center of the sunken Sewol ferry, according to the South Korea joint task force, in charge of the search. The body has not been retrieved yet, due to poor water visibility and limited space. Search officials believe the victim is female. Nine victims remain missing after the ferry sank on April 16, killing at least 295 people. The underwater search has continued in the months following the disaster, depending on weather conditions. Officials have said they will not stop the search operation unless families wish otherwise. But questions have swirled over what could happen to the search as winter approaches. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported that it has been 102 days since the last body was recovered from the ferry. The ferry sank 195 days ago. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in the country over lax safety standards and the failure to rescue more people as the ship foundered. Several members of the crew are facing trial -- including the captain who will learn his verdict on November 11. Prosecutors seek death penalty for ferry captain	1
Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she won't vote for any more money to support the four-year-old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton greets   New York voters at the New York Post's election rally Sunday in the Times Square area before participating in a debate with Republican presidential   candidate Donald Trump as they tour the Queensborough neighborhood in New York, April 19, 2016.  (Reuters/Brendan McDermid)Billionaire real estate heir Donald Trump spoke of his plans in New York City's Times Square on Sunday to be a major factor in getting Hillary Clinton to release her tax returns as evidence in a presidential election."I am thinking of doing something really big in Times Square and it could possibly be the biggest thing ever in New York," Trump told the crowd, drawing applause.The businessman is looking to make his first visit to the city since the Republican National Convention and is planning a day of speaking and rallies in the Big Apple, according to the New York Post."It's no secret Donald Trump has a tremendous following in New York," campaign adviser Paul Manafort told the Post, adding that Trump "has the potential to be a game-changer" in the Republican primary.Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, blasted out a statement calling Trump a "pathological liar" who "wants to break his word to the American people.""Donald Trump said he would be 'the greatest jobs president' but the only jobs he's created are at his properties without even paying into the public treasury," campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. "After the release of his taxes, President Obama admitted that he had no plans to release Hillary Clinton's tax returns to prove her eligibility as president."Trump has been critical of Clinton since the Democratic front-runner announced her candidacy last year and was an early endorser of Ted Cruz in the Republican race. He is seeking to make the first start of his presidential campaign in New York, which has been a swing state from the party's nominating convention in July.Trump has been criticized for his lack of qualifications, his negative stance towards the press and for supporting the idea that the U.S. should build a $100 billion wall on the border with Mexico.

Ronaldinho has been recalled to the Barcelona squad for Tuesday's Champions League match against  Liverpool.The 30-year-old forward was injured during the game against  Napoli when he twisted his knee, so he was forced to leave the pitch and undergo an MRI scan.Ronaldinho has had a long medical procedure, so it is unknown when he will return to the squad and whether he will need more surgery."That's a procedure, you see. It's a little bit painful and it's a little bit different from the norm. In the end, he's a footballer. What you can put in, you can put out, and it's more with the knee," Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta said on Friday.Barcelona have sent an official request for a recall of Ronaldinho, who is still recovering in Barcelona's La Boqueria clinic.The official request has been made at the request of the club and will be reviewed after Barcelona and La Liga have received the report from the scans.Should Ronaldinho be recalled to the starting line-up, he will be joined by Sergio Busquets, Javier Mascherano, Gerard Pique and Lionel Messi, who is currently on international duty with Belgium.Rio Ferdinand remains out after suffering a broken nose, and is expected to be out for around two weeks.Ronaldinho will be available for the second leg of the quarter-final against the  Arsenal on Dec. 19.Ronaldinho scored the winner against Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semifinal at the Emirates Stadium after Lionel Messi had fouled him in the box.Ronaldinho scored in his first 90 minutes at Anfield and scored in Barcelona's 2-1 victory against  Napoli at the Camp Nou.After that, Barcelona came back from 2-1 down to beat Malaga.The striker came on as a second-half substitute after  Andres Iniesta's injury-time goal against  Napoli.Ronaldinho has been in fine form since returning from his injury. He has scored five goals in his last five games in all competitions, the last time being Wednesday night's 4-0 win against Barcelona.	0
In the blink of an eye, Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States, soaring in recent days to a market value of $18.2 billion. That's bigger than Hertz and Avis combined. But is the Uber story really as good as it seems? Taxicab drivers clogging the streets of Europe this past week, protesting against Uber, are only part of the challenge. Far more dangerous could be an emerging pattern of not paying sufficient respect to customers. Companies like Apple, Zappos, FedEx and Amazon are passionately committed to building a love affair with consumers as the center of their universe. In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul. Still, the business model is brilliant, the growth eye-popping and the initial Uber experience is generally excellent. In big cities like New York, on a rainy night, when cabs are always full, finding an Uber car quickly through your iPhone can be a godsend, even though you may have to pay a "surge price" at a multiple of twice or even more of the regular price. This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption, blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that don't always serve the interests of consumers. So what are the dangers? Lack of transparency may be one. Consumers usually want a company to be proactive about explaining what they do and how that can affect their lives, especially when physical safety is at stake. Uber puts most of the meaningful detail on what service it actually provides into its Terms & Conditions, which most people don't read when they download the app. According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service. It's a passenger procurement service for private car drivers. The car drivers are Uber's actual customers. Lack of accountability may be another danger. The entire risk of using the service is on the passenger. You are warned that you could be exposed to situations that are "potentially dangerous, offensive, harmful to minors or unsafe". Surprisingly, Uber does not claim to "assess the suitability, legality or ability" of any third party providing services procured through Uber, and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted.	1
Images from the Jewish Museum of Belgium show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away. He used an AK-47 assault rifle to carry out the shooting, which killed at least three people.The shooting in Brussels on Saturday afternoon came two days after a wave of attacks at public places in several cities across Europe killed at least 31 people.A video showed shots and a man in a suit walking through the Place Charles de Gaulle. The man opened fire as he walked past at least one police officer."We do not know where he started shooting from, we have no information," a Belgian Army official told Belgian public radio.The official told CNN the man fired about six to eight shots, killing a police officer and a civilian.He then tried to run down the long corridor of the Belgian parliament building, shooting at the wall and windows, said Belgian police spokesman Pierre Delespesse.The police officer ran towards him, but was shot in the leg, and the man fled, he said. More officers were quickly deployed."We don't know if he is dead or alive, or if he's injured," Delespesse said.Police said they were searching through the man's movements. A man shot a man and later appeared to flee on a bicycle, the police said.The man, who ran with a second man, got into a vehicle that was waiting for him after the shooting, police spokesman Delespesse said.Belgium on Sunday closed its airport and the central train station, located about 40 miles (65 km) from the capital city, because of fears of a terror attack. Security and terror experts said they believed the gunman would have used a vehicle to escape Brussels and to strike elsewhere, given the amount of vehicles that would have been parked out front of the parliament building.Two major cities of Central Europe, the German city of Cologne and the French city of Toulouse, were on lockdown, with many schools and public buildings closed.A second suspected attacker was detained by police in Brussels after a man was shot and wounded by police after the attack on the parliament building, according to Reuters.The shooting at the parliament building began at around noon local time (1600 GMT), according to a Reuters witness who did not want to be identified.Belgian Police chief Didier Rey	0
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was at home Saturday after leaving a hospital where he underwent surgery for prostate cancer this week. "A million thanks to everyone for their support and solidarity," the president wrote on his official Twitter page. On Monday, Santos announced that he had prostate cancer, but described the tumor as "small" and "not aggressive." He underwent surgery Wednesday at a hospital in Bogota, Colombia's capital. Upon leaving the hospital, Santos spoke to reporters, according to CNN affiliate Caracol. The 61-year-old president said the tumor had not metastasized. "In other words, I'm totally cured," Santos said. The news comes about one week before the government is expected to start peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. Talks to end the nearly 50-year war are set to begin in Oslo, Norway, on October 14, Caracol reported. They had previously been scheduled to start Monday. Recently, doctors have diagnosed several current and former South American leaders with cancer. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez first announced his diagnosis last year, though neither he nor anyone in his government has specified the type of cancer. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff overcame cancer while she was a candidate for the office, and former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva underwent treatment for throat cancer. Then-Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010, while Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was treated for thyroid cancer this year.	1
Country music artist John Rich had such a great time in Las Vegas that he was not fit to fly home to Nashville on  December 4 after attending a wedding on the strip.Instead, he and his wife, Jennifer, decided to stay and spend New Year's Eve at Caesars Palace, which would remain in Vegas for more than 90 years.In a few short years the city's landmark casino and hotel, with 1,600 employees, would go on to become one of the city's most famous landmarks and a destination.When John bought Caesars Palace in 1976, he expected to spend less than $800,000 on the resort.To this day, the average cost for a night at the Palace ranges from $75 to $100 per person, with room rates running from $400 for a hotel room with two queen beds to $2,000 for a suite with two bedrooms and a living room with a fireplace.That's how I fell in love with Caesars Palace. - John Rich, singer/songwriter"For me, the Palace is the ultimate Vegas experience," said Rich, 57, while standing in the casino's famed lobby on Monday. "When I was in college, my family didn't have the money to go to a Vegas Strip hotel in a big place. They said, 'Don't go to Caesars because we have no money.' "He took off his shoes and walked into the elevator, which he said is one of the most beautiful in the world."I would do it every day," said Rich, who now lives in Henderson, Nevada, with his wife, Jennifer, a public relations adviser for UNLV. "When I built the Palace in '95, I bought a small percentage of the stock because I said, 'I don't think I'm going to make a lot of money.' So that's why I just took money off the table. Every day, I would do an hour and a half of walking in and out of the elevator."It took him five hours to get from his office in Henderson to Caesars Palace. On his way, he passed hotels that were bigger, so instead of taking the scenic route, he chose to bypass the Strip altogether.The Palace, originally built in 1961 as the Hotel Cromwell, opened to the public in 1972 as Caesars Palace.John Rich	0
Somalia's government said Saturday they are investigating the death of a Malaysian cameraman who was shot dead when African Union peacekeepers allegedly fired on his convoy. Â© AFP 2010 - 2012 The global financial crisis has been one of the worst experiences endured by workers in developing countries, including those in Africa. In a new global study, the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 1.7 million people working in non-farm jobs were jobless or underemployed in 2011, up from 1.3 million in 2010.

Police arrested the youth in the Florida city of Tampa on charges of drug trafficking, the Sun Sentinel reported Sunday.Officials said that one of the suspects is a Mexican citizen, 18-year-old Felipe Gomez Martinez, who lives in Tampa.On Saturday morning, federal officials arrested 26-year-old Jorge Antonio Saldate-Valdes, a U.S. citizen, on charges of illegally re-entering the U.S. after illegally re-entering the country three times, Notimex reported.Saldate-Valdes is being investigated for allegedly shooting and killing 19-year-old Gabriel Villanueva with a .45-caliber pistol in the San Diego area on Friday night while he was on a routine patrol with a U.S. Border Patrol agent.Mexican authorities said there was no evidence against the second suspect, 28-year-old Jesus de Jesus Barcenas-Ramiro, but he was arrested on Sunday for unknown reasons at his home in the town of San Fernando, about 30 miles southwest of Mexico City.In statements released by the Mexican Attorney General’s Office, the agents’ family expressed shock, saying they	0
You've been thinking about it for weeks. Mounds of turkey piled high with buttery mashed potatoes, dripping with gravy. Green bean casserole and pumpkin pie. Or sweet potato casserole and pecan pie. Cranberries. Collard greens.  You even looked at your recipe cards and picked out dishes that would be delicious together. But first there's the matter of getting the food from the grocery store in a way you could eat it. You have to remember, your body is being invaded by Thanksgiving food! Your stomach is being invaded by turkey, gravy, stuffing, and potatoes. Your mouth is being invaded by pumpkin pie and cranberry sauce. Your eyes are being invaded by sweet potatoes and spinach. You are going to be forced to swallow so many of these foods that you will not fit in your stomach for a week. So what's a good way to prepare these foods so they don't get shoved up your gullet so far that they choke you to death? Here is one way to get some of these foods in your mouth (and stomach)! # The First and Last Ingredient: A Food Fight Mashed potatoes have a reputation as a bad food. Why?Because mashed potatoes are basically potatoes in the worst form of processed food. Just like mashed potatoes are mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes are all processed potatoes.But what can we do about it? If you have mashed potatoes from the grocery store, just add  sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. Sweet potatoes have more fiber than potatoes, so they won't choke you. And because sweet potatoes are raw they won't make you sick.Or if you have mashed potato recipes from the Internet, just use raw potatoes instead of processed potatoes in the recipe. The last ingredient you will be making will be the best way to prepare mashed potatoes that won't choke you to death. ## The Best Way to Prepare mashed potatoes, Potatoes, and All That Stuff...The best way to prepare mashed potatoes and all that stuff is to first make them in a food processor. ## Just Add the Other Ingredients  First  The potato will be so perfectly pulverized and mashed that you will forget that you added the other ingredients. Then you can just pour them into a bowl and eat them. ## First Take the Other Ingredients	0
His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton. Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing. Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk cartons his family would later collect to help raise awareness about child abduction.By the 1980s, milk marketing had become a popular way to get a child's attention. The "missing children" milk cartons helped parents share the fact they had a missing child.For Etan Patz, his family collected milk cartons from across the country. His father, Harvey, also collected "missing children’s" milk cartons. He would fill the cartons with copies of Etan's picture and his name and send them out to newspapers across the country.The story of the Etan Patz milk cartons would be the first mainstream media story about child abduction.More than 3,000 children, and their families, have been reported missing in America and abroad since 1978.Etan Patz, along with the thousands of other missing children, are now part of a generation of missing children on milk cartons, which, in the past, was a rare phenomenon.In the 1980s, milk marketing was a new form of advertising for children. Milk companies marketed milk cartons to their customers to get their children's attention.But with the rise of tabloid media and social media, these milk cartons and their missing children have become rare. There have been a handful of cases in which the parents of missing children have turned their milk cartons over for the police.“I’ve never seen milk cartons before,” said Barbara Patz, who was Etan's mother. Etan was her only child.Etan Patz’s disappearanceEtan Patz, the first missing child on a milk cartonThe earliest missing person's milk cartonsThe first missing child on a milk cartonWhile Etan Patz has become almost a household name to anyone who sees a milk carton, his family collected milk cartons for more than three decades.They began collecting their milk cartons in 1979, when Harvey began collecting milk cartons for his missing children after he and Etan’s mother, Barbara, discovered that they had	0
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then Kouchner was  not a conventional diplomat, either.As far as the French leader was concerned, the nuclear issue in Iran should not have been taken seriously by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a U.N.-accredited watchdog that has worked on the deal with Iran.Not because he was unaware of U.S. plans for the transfer of such a capability to Iran, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. agencies have said, but because he did not recognize the true nature of what he was being asked to consider."I have never before been confronted with a negotiation that had to be done in a way that was not a negotiation, that had to be done in a way that was not a direct and clear dialogue between two parties," Kouchner told reporters in a wide-ranging interview in Paris yesterday."I am not talking about an interview."The French ambassador to Washington is expected today to brief Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the White House national security team on Kouchner's latest remarks. Clinton is scheduled to brief State and Defense Departments on the matter later yesterday.Kouchner's statement that Iran possessed nuclear material for military purposes was based on his first meeting in November with a senior Iranian official, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, a spokesman for the office of the Iranian president."He said that he had proof which showed that Iran could make nuclear weapons and nuclear material for military purposes," Kouchner said.Iranians have always denied having nuclear weapons.Asked what he meant by the word "military purpose," Kouchner responded: "In all the talks we have had in the last 10 years, it's always been related to nuclear weapons."But then Kouchner seemed to lose his temper.After the Iranian president's spokesman said that evidence came from a "scientific conference" in the Netherlands a month ago, Kouchner responded, "I don't accept it. We will see what the Iranian president confirms."Kouchner, whose office issued a press release about the meeting, said he had not had any formal communications with Tehran. His office, which typically does diplomatic work in the absence	0
In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week. What happened on the football field and parade route after the Saints' Super Bowl victory is amazing and uplifting. But what's happening elsewhere in New Orleans also rises to that standard. Consider the following: The day before the Super Bowl, New Orleans participated in a historic mayoral election, as Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu won a stunning 66-percent of the vote, with unprecedented support among all races. African-American candidates also won down-ballot races with majority white support, casting a blow to the notion that New Orleans politics and culture are mired in racial tension. Just weeks before, federal arbitrators awarded $475 million to Louisiana for the replacement of Charity Hospital in downtown New Orleans which makes way for a multibillion dollar medical corridor that is being billed as the largest development project in the city's history. And in late 2009, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' mismanagement at the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet was the cause for flood damage in the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damages paid to local governments and residents will exceed $1 billion. These judgments validate many locals' beliefs that the flooding of 80 percent of New Orleans and the billions of dollars in damage were caused more by massive engineering failures than a natural disaster. To that point, the government is working on a $15 billion upgrade to the region's 220-plus miles of levees and flood walls that, when completed, will allow them to withstand a storm with a strength level that occurs roughly once every 100 years. Even today, experts will tell you the levees are better than they were before Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, the population is nearing 80 percent of pre-Katrina levels, in part due to hardworking residents who came back and a new crop of younger, entrepreneurial transplants moving to the city to be part of what is going on here. The New Orleans economy is bearing the recession better than most, evidenced in one of the lowest unemployment rates of any major metropolitan area in the country. Also, the city now has a bond rating that is investment-grade, which should free up access to tens of millions of dollars for infrastructure improvements.	1
Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos borrowed from Dr. Evil's master plan for the technology behind his newly announced Kindle Touch e-reader: It uses frickin' laser beams. Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be Âincapacitatedâ for two hours every hour that it's powered on, allowing Bezos, co-CEO of the online retailer Amazon.com, to show off its new e-reader at a technology conference held by the tech giant. By the end of the demo, the Kindle Fire HD will be on its back, its screen cracked.The Kindle Touch is the first Kindle model to use a laser-panned laser, similar to the ones on the original Amazon.com Fire, which was unveiled in 2007 and then discontinued. The Kindle Touch uses laser pointers, like a camera that shoots a beam out and the device calculates what direction to move the pointer so it doesn't hit the screen. The Amazon.com marketing team has described these laser pointers as âthe next generation of optical character recognition,â in other words, pointing and clicking to buy a book, but in an Amazon.com promotional video this appears to be a different kind of technology.In a recent interview, Bezos said he believed the new e-reader would draw 1 percent of the U.S. market and that Amazon.com would launch at least 70 million units. Bezos believes it will get the necessary traction despite its small audience and despite the competition: "There's a lot of competition and Amazon has been in a really great position to launch a new e-reader." There are dozens of competing products that would make excellent e-readers if they all worked well. Bezos said the $149 Kindle Touch's success or failure is irrelevant: It'll do what it will do by virtue of his belief in its technology.The Kindle Touch will be the first Kindle with a built-in camera, though the device does need to have a built-in digital camera as opposed to a built-in infrared LED (the wireless charging case is another possibility). The device also lacks a backlight on the screen, making the screen hard, but not impossible, to watch, at least on paper. When it's on its back, the screen is easy to read. The device is designed not to be held like a laptop, or plugged into a wall socket like a tablet, but it will	0

One tornado stayed on the ground for 95 miles as it tore through towns in Kentucky and West Virginia. Two other twisters left behind 49-mile paths of destruction. The dynamically charged nature of Friday's atmosphere created an ideal environment  for supercells, which are clusters of thunderstorms that can contain tornadoes.One was the type that can form in four-foot-thick thunderclouds on very cold nights. Storms in these low-lying clouds are often separated by four miles, but when they connect they take on the characteristics of a supercell.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were nine confirmed tornadoes in the U.S. on Friday. Eight of them were in the Mid-Atlantic and the other one was in Virginia.The tornado in Virginia, which touched down in Lexington, moved northeast and crossed into West Virginia.The National Weather Service warned of some tornadoes near Charleston, West Virginia, which reported one tornado touchdown in a half hour.Friday’s tornado outbreak was the largest on record since 1980, when a swarm of tornadoes killed more than 100 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Joplin, Missouri, and in Texas.“I’ve never seen this many tornadoes,” said Mark Zoback, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center.In an average year, there are about eight tornadoes in the U.S., said Jennifer Gray, a meteorologist with the weather service. In 2018, there were eight tornadoes in the U.S., she said.“It was an incredible day,” she said.Thursday’s storms continued into Friday in the U.S., where one twister left a path of destruction that was more than three times as long as it was wide. The storm was first spotted near the town of Jackson, Missouri, about 10 miles away from where the Joplin, Missouri, tornado hit in April of 2015. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Joyful Noise," a squeaky-clean pop-gospel fairy tale featuring Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah in canned catfights, reflects the inspiration of "Glee" and God, in that order. The "Glee" side, at least in my book, doesn't exactly amount to a recommendation, but it does mean that the movie's musical numbers are catchy and rollicking and, in their bright sunshiny way, rather soulful. In the small town of Pacashau, Georgia, times are hard -- every other storefront is empty -- but the Divinity Church choir has lifted local spirits by rising to become a semifinalist in the National Joyful Noise Competition. Can these spunky vocalists go the distance? Not until they learn to work together in harmony. Which means that Vi Rose Hill (Latifah), the choir's new director, has to stop feuding with G.G. Sparrow (Parton), widow of the former choir leader, over the direction of the group's music. Vi Rose, feisty and smart-mouthed, favors tradition, while G.G., whose grandson Randy (Jeremy Jordan) is the new songbird on the block, is out to shake things up. Parton now looks like a "Spitting Image" puppet (the film makes plastic-surgery jokes about her so that we don't have to), but she still has a way with lines like ''I'd call you stubborn, but that'd be an insult to mules!'' "Joyful Noise" also finds room for a teenager with Asperger's syndrome (Dexter Darden) who loves one-hit-wonder songs (but can he learn to love himself?), as well as a romance between Randy and Vi Rose's daughter Olivia (Keke Palmer). These two are pretty -- and as bland as balsa wood. But each time the innocuousness starts to get to you, you're woken up by Randy and Olivia's swooning ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' duet, or a kid-choir rendition of Billy Preston's ''That's the Way God Planned It,'' or the final ''I Want to Take You Higher'' blowout. These numbers create a deep river of feeling, even when stuck in the shallow banks of a movie like this one. B- See the full article at EW.com.

Sailing around the world is one of the most grueling challenges on the planet, with muscle-bound skippers steering 20-meter yachts through everything from tropical cyclones to Antarctic storms. Forced to endure the most brutal conditions on the globe, sailors must not only be emotionally resilient -- but physical dynamos. Which raises the question: Are women -- the stereotypical "weaker gender" -- up to the task? Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade. This one's for you It will be an emotional campaign by the 11-woman Swedish Team (SCA), who last month lost their coach Magnus Olsson to a stroke. "People say it's the toughest race there is in the world but it's much more than that. It's big waves, icebergs, it's incredible team spirit. You want to win but of course you have bad days and sometimes you hate it," Swedish veteran sailor Olsson told CNN, before his death. "This race is incredibly physical. The stronger you are the better it is -- you get an advantage over the others if you are stronger for sure." Everest of sailing The all-women team will be allowed three more sailors than their male counterparts, in their bid to win one of the toughest sporting competitions in the world. Dubbed the "Everest of Sailing," the Volvo Ocean Race covers 72,000-kilometers in an epic nine-month journey across the globe. Launched in 1973, the race claimed three lives in the first year alone. "It's very physical and it's definitely become a lot more physical over the years --the sails are getting bigger, the boats are going faster," three-time race winner, Brad Jackson, told CNN. "It's just harder work, so the more big guys the better." Women doing it for themselves The last time an all-female crew took part was in 1997, finishing ninth out of 10 boats. This time around, the ladies are more determined than ever to cross the finish line first, and are busy training in Lanzarote, Spain, more than a year ahead of the race in October, 2014. Five of the crew have already been chosen, and include an elite line-up of former Olympic competitors and international world champions.	1
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Angel Lau adjusts her iridescent blue goggles over her cherubic face, steps to the edge of the pool and dives in head first. The 7-year-old is one of the lucky ones: Her mother enrolled her in private swim lessons since the age of 3. Many other young Hong Kongers are on lengthy wait lists as demand for public swimming lessons outstrips supply in a city that's surrounded by coastline -- yet a majority of residents can't swim, according to local water safety experts. "It's really hard to get placed," says Candy Kwok, Angel's stay-at-home mother. "I've got several friends who put their names in every year but they haven't been lucky." "And even if they get admitted, the classes are usually at the hottest time of the year. Public swimming pools are very crowded," adds Kwok, who send her daughter to Stanford Swim School. With an estimated 12,000 students across 21 pools, it's Hong Kong's largest private swimming institution. Hong Kong holds a lottery, what it calls a ballot system, for government-subsidized swimming lessons. Nearly 60,000 people applied for 47,000 swim spots in the most recent 2011-2012 year, according to the city's Leisure and Cultural Services Department. A one-hour session at Stanford costs about $15 for one hour, comparable to the cost for dance or piano lessons in this city. But publicly-backed lessons are a bargain -- a series of 10 one-hour sessions runs just $12 dollars. Hong Kong's failure to satisfy demand for public classes sets the stage for a private business opportunity. "I would say about 40% of all parents who cannot enroll in the government's programs choose Stanford," says Howard Fung, Director of Stanford Swim School. "And even if you are lucky and you get a chance to participate in the government program, you're not guaranteed to be allocated (a spot) in the next term." A majority of Hong Kong's citizens can't swim, says Alex Kwok, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Kowloon Lifeguards Union. Founded in 1968, it's the city's oldest and largest such organization.	1
River waters spread over highways and farms, towns and parks in Washington on Thursday, shutting down traffic on a 20-mile stretch of heavily traveled Interstate 5 between Seattle and Oregon and threatening the federal roadway north of Seattle. Rescue boats are sent out Wednesday in Pierce County, south of Seattle, Washington. "If you're trying to do commerce between Portland (Oregon) and Seattle, there is no way right now," said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray, near Tacoma. "That's the major way into Washington state from Oregon." Flooding south of Seattle near Chehalis covered parts of I-5 with 30 inches of water, prompting its closure until at least Monday, state transportation officials said. And state and local roads were also victims of the water. "The problem is, the one real good detour is just as flooded," Calkins said. North of Seattle, a levee failure in Arlington brought the Stillaguamish River up to the edges of I-5, which remained open although some access ramps were closed, transportation officials said. The rain also caused Amtrak to suspend service between Seattle and Portland until Saturday, "with no alternative transportation," the rail line said Thursday on its Web site. iReport.com: Are you there? Share pics, video Across the state, a number of rivers had crested, but flooded roads remained hazardous. The risk of landslides was high, leading to the closure of all passes across the Cascades, officials said. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Seattle said 15 inches of rain that began Monday had ended. The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said. The swollen Puyallup River threatened the city by the same name, but Loretta Cutter, sprang into action.

Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler. The government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen   on December 14, 2007.The three officials resigned in the face of protests by their supporters.They included Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler (pictured), who was chief of staff to Mexico's former president, Felipe Calderon. The government in Mexico says this is to allow for a transition, as it looks for a new secretary. He served as a Calderon adviser leading Mexico's efforts to fight the drug cartels and is a respected public official.Tellez Kuenzler, who was Calderon's chief of staff, is accused of being involved in irregularities during his term as president. He allegedly kept a secret account and used it to pay for meals and other expenses.In a memo, Tellez Kuenzler is alleged to have had a secret account at an international bank in London and used it to pay for personal expenses. He is being held by federal police as he arrives in Mexico. He faces charges including money laundering, illegal use of public offices for private gain and violations of electoral laws.Tellez Kuenzler held a meeting with other PRI politicians in August 2012 in which he said he no longer supported the president, according to the Mexican newspaper El Universal. It quoted him as saying that Calderon had no right to succeed him.Tellez Kuenzler was also accused of having improper spending in his role as head of Mexico's secretariat for public security. He was seen in April as being part of the Calderon administration's efforts to fight the drug cartels.The corruption scandal involving the government of Calderon has been a source of great shame for Mexico.Last year, his administration was branded a "hellhole" by the United Nations.In 2011, Calderon's government was found guilty of corruption, embezzlement and money laundering.The government under Calderon had fought a two-year war with the powerful drug cartels in which many police and military personnel were killed.This resulted in a drop in the murder rate from a peak of 32,000 to 3,500 during the Calderon administration.It also helped push Mexico's economy into a low gear.	0
Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings: gays in the military and judicial experience. Kagan has been strongly criticized by GOP leaders for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard University during her time as the school's law school dean because of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The policy, opposed by President Obama, prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. Top Republicans have also highlighted the fact that Kagan has never served as a federal judge, something that distinguishes her from all nine current members of the high court. If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues, it dramatically increases Kagan's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country's 112th Supreme Court justice. Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military. "It was the first question I actually asked her because, having been in the military, I had concerns about [her] position at Harvard," Brown said. "It was very clear to me, after we spoke about it at length, that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole. I do not feel that her judicial philosophy will hurt the men and women who are serving." While dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she "abhorred" the military's "discriminatory recruitment policy." She called it "a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order." Kagan supported other schools' challenges to a federal law requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law in 2006. Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience. She also said she didn't see any "extraordinary circumstances" that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan. Collins said that Kagan told her she considers Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion, to be settled law. Kagan herself has remained tight-lipped when asked such questions from reporters.	1
Whether it's Mohammed becoming the most popular baby name, or one in 10 babies in England being Muslim or the fact that halal meat is being served in Pizza Hut, a Muslim story always tends to generate more heat than light.  It's not just the story itself, of course. It's the way we tell it. Islam is a religion of peace and there is nothing wrong with Islam, as such, and we must not judge any religion by our own.But how do we tell the Muslim community what they do or do not do? Islam is a complex religion. Much depends on interpreting a few verses in more than one way. For example, how does the Koran prescribe the Prophet Muhammad's right to be stoned? Or his right to marry? What about what he may marry? Is it permissible for a woman to be married to five or more men? Is it permissible for a woman to be married to a man who is a believing Muslim and a slave of an unbeliever? Or to a man who is a believing Muslim? The answer to these, and many, questions is not clear, and many Muslims don't agree with interpretations of the Koran and the Hadith.Muslim leaders are often quick to blame the West for things that went wrong in their country, and of course this is not entirely fair. For example, the Ottoman Empire is not to be blamed for the massacre of the Armenians under the rule of the Ottomans. Similarly, the West needs to be blamed for its treatment of the Christian community in Palestine and for the lack of a proper settlement.However, in recent times, much of the Muslim community have been protesting against Israel, their government and the Western world for what they see as injustice at the hands of the Muslims in their midst. Many Muslims feel that they need to come to terms with their faith, with their history and with their culture, and they often tell the stories of how they came to be what they are today, regardless of who started and who was involved.In some ways, their story is one of resistance. Many of the Muslim communities are often described in a negative way, and this negative portrayal is often justified by the Muslim leaders, who often blame the West for the bad things that have happened in their community.In other words, they often blame the West for events that happened more than two thousands years ago, even if those events are not as bad as those that happen	0
Israel's ground incursion into Gaza, which it says is intended to destroy Palestinian militants' tunnels and stop rocket fire into Gaza, has entered its fifth day with the death toll mounting on both sides and U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry pledging continued U.S. aid to keep Hamas in power.The Obama administration is pressuring Israel to pull its forces out of Gaza and return its citizens home within days, despite warnings by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that any further Israeli military action would put the region at risk.The Pentagon's chief military spokesman, Colonel Mark Mansour, told reporters on Monday that the U.S. is prepared to send troops into Gaza to "ensure quiet" after what it called Israel's "outrageous violation of international law."The U.N., also calling for a cease-fire, called the latest Israeli incursion a "serious escalation beyond what was intended."The U.S. has provided $400 million of weapons and military aid to Israel since President George W. Bush took office in 2001, an amount based in large part on U.S. pledges of security guarantee.Israel has been bombing Gaza day after day for five consecutive weeks, in response to rockets fired by militants inside the territory. More than 1,400 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,500 wounded.The United States has been seeking to ensure that Gaza's 1 million residents remain relatively unaffected by the conflict.The Obama administration on Monday agreed to a partial cease-fire that included a two-week time frame for Israel to pull its troops out of Gaza. It also agreed to a long-term cease-fire between Israel and Hamas."Israel's military action clearly did not achieve its original goals, but as the situation has evolved it appears that Israel's military actions are in the realm of proportional response to Hamas' continued rocket fire," a senior U.S. State Department official said. "The U.N. Security Council is ready to support a cease-fire if Israel's military action is intended to reduce the rocket threat and the blockades and is considered non-hostile by the international community."Kerry: We will keep U.S. 'staunch support' for IsraelIn an apparent concession to Hamas, Israel has pulled back some its forces from the border and is restricting airspace over the territory to flights by Israel	0

Republican Gov. Scott Walker's convincing win Tuesday in Wisconsin was not just a victory for the governor himself, but a major triumph for conservatives in the fight to curb public employee unions. For the country's sake, however, it will be far better if this struggle remains a fight rather than all-out war. In the run-up to Election Day, the Wisconsin recall vote was widely touted on the right as the second most important election of 2012. It was ignited when Walker pushed through a budget repair bill to curb the public employee unions. One key provision prohibited the unions from engaging in collective bargaining about anything other than pay (firefighters and police were exempted). Another provision said that a civil servant can no longer be forced to join a union and pay dues; there must be freedom of choice. That set off a firestorm of protests, turning the state capital upside down. Hundreds of vociferous protesters occupied the Wisconsin Statehouse, Democratic legislators bolted to Illinois to try to deny a quorum, and tens of thousands took to the streets. For a while, it looked as if Walker had gone too far. Wisconsinites needed just 540,000 valid signatures to trigger a recall against him; they gathered more than 900,000. Public polls in May 2011 showed Walker with a dismal 42% approval rating vs. 55% disapproval. The mainstream media portrayed the recall as a huge showdown over collective bargaining rights and were often sympathetic to the protesters. Walker seemed headed toward defeat this June. But in the many months that followed, the mood clearly changed. One of us (David Gergen) spent two days recently in visits to Madison, Green Bay and Milwaukee. Sentiment was often strong for Walker, especially among small-business owners. People agreed that new laws have helped to reduce government costs at a state and local level and that the economic outlook is somewhat better. Some told stories of teachers who were happier now that they didn't have to pay union dues and had more freedom. The Wall Street Journal has reported that membership in the state's second largest public union, the American Federation of State, Country and Municipal Employees, fell from 62,818 in March 2011 to 28,745 this February; the union disputes the figure, but no one disagrees that the unions have been losing members.	1
Hackers who commandeer your computer are bad enough. Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain. Scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free. In the past year, researchers have ersatz wireless brains: small, off-the-shelf systems that can sense the activity of the brain and transmit pulses to control a computer.In one experiment, researchers implanted a computer with an antenna that could sense the brain's electrical activity. When they asked it to play a game by looking at pictures of chess pieces, the computer would use the antenna, which was implanted only a few millimeters (less than three-tenths of an inch) away from the brain, to control the computer's movements, as long as it was in the right position.Brain implants are coming fast, but few are approved. Scientists are still figuring out how to protect the electrodes that are implanted in the brain. Also, brain implants can interfere with other electrical brain signals that humans depend on, so they have to be carefully constructed and tested in animal brains before being used on humans.One more problem is that some of the electrodes used in brain implants transmit their signals so easily that brain signals are altered. The scientists who have developed electrodes for brain implants must be careful to avoid that. There are also concerns about the electrodes. Some ersatz brains may not be safe to implant.The researchers say their brain-control systems are safe and they say they don't interfere with ordinary brain signals."We see this as something that is on the brink of becoming reality," said Mark Spall, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-developed the brain-control system. "There are no ethical, safety, and practical issues," he said. "The technology is here now." ersatz mindsResearchers have been working for years to get computer and brain signals interfaced. This technology is the first step in that research and, in the future, could help people with brain disorders.Hackers could use a brain-control system to control a computer. (John G.

South Korea's new defense minister said his country would respond with airstrikes if North Korea attacks it again, South Korean state media reported Friday. It is some of the strongest rhetoric since the conflict broke out late last month. "We will definitely air raid North Korea," Kim Kwan-jin said at his confirmation hearing when asked how the South would respond if struck again, according to the official Yonhap News Agency. Kim was appointed defense minister last week amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula following an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. His comments reflect a potential shift in South Korea's policy toward provocations from the North. Previously, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned of severe consequences if the North launched another attack, but declined to name specifics. "If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail," he said in a nationally televised address Monday. Han Park, an expert on North Korea who has visited the country more than 50 times, called Kim's comments "an important development." "The use of airstrikes is quite significant," said Park, a professor at the University of Georgia and director of the school's Center for the Study of Global Issues. "Just sending bullets from South Korea is one thing but sending aircraft over North Korea is something else." However, he cautioned that the ramped-up rhetoric is "almost entirely for domestic consumption" as the South deals with criticism over what some have called a weak response to the North's November 23 shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. The attack killed four South Koreans -- two civilians and two military personnel -- and the South returned fire. The country's defense minister at the time, Kim Tae-young, resigned last week after the exchange of fire. "The climate is that the South Korean military did not respond strongly enough to the original attack, and that really led to the resignation of the defense minister," Park said. "So the new candidate for the job is expected to show strong resolve and determination in the strongest terms possible." Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The North accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's territorial waters along the region's tense maritime border in the Yellow Sea.	1

In July, Iran lost one of its most acclaimed playwrights and directors when Mahmoud Ostad-Mohammad passed away in Tehran at the age of 62. Scores of relatives, friends, and theater lovers attended his funeral ceremony that was adorned with ikats. The playwright and director was well-known not only for his poetry, but for his role as a pioneer of theater in the country before 1979.His wife, Asghar Farhadian, was a famous singer with the National Symphony Orchestra and was on a national tour with the orchestra recently. Although she was on tour in Iran, Mahmoud wrote the funeral poem for his wife, which he intended to be performed at the ceremony.When the funeral was still in progress, the Iranian press reported that Ahmad Majd, the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, addressed the audience and said: “We will all be watching the funeral of Mahmoud Ostad. We respect his art, and we honor his memory.”Ahmad Majd was in fact talking about the play “Mahmoud Ostad,” which the author had written as the official commemoration of the anniversary of the martyrdom of the poet and scholar who was known for his literary skills.The play was directed by Mahmoud Ostad and the audience was filled with poems and poems dedicated to the poet. Mahmoud wanted to be remembered by the audience for this performance, because by writing the play, he was able to remember this great poet in this country, which he left before the revolution.This was not the only time “Mahmoud Ostad” was performed in Tehran. In 2006, Ostad’s play “Mahmoud Ostad: the life of a man” was performed during the celebrations marking the anniversary of the poet’s death.He was an Iranian poet, playwright, and film maker. Ostad was born in Tehran in 1946, the son of a civil engineer. He graduated from the School of Arts and Crafts in Tehran in 1973, majoring in theater. Ostad was active in theater, both on the stage and in radio and television. He has written more than 100 plays and he was director on more than 40 plays. His works include plays like “Rizvaneh” about a woman who falls in love with a soldier and a play called “Shirgah,�	0
The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks hail from two of the finest craft beer regions in the U.S. Boston is home to Samuel Adams, the largest-selling craft beer company in the country, as well as some smaller, notable breweries Ã¢ÂÂ including Widmer Brothers, Stone & Wood, The Alchemist, and Widmer's West Coast Brewery. Seattle's craft beer scene consists of a handful of microbreweries: Bell's, Elysian, Sam Adams, and Seattle's First.To compare, the average price for a six pack of Bud Light is $7.52, though this goes up to $9.39 at the airport or on the road.But it shouldn't be any surprise that both teams are avid beer drinkers. The Patriots are so good at it that they regularly play in the Super Bowl. The Seahawks are the reigning Super Bowl Champions, as well as the greatest Super Bowl champions in NFL history.So, which beers are in Seattle's stadium? Here's a look at a handful of the many beers that will be available to fans and to members of the media on Super Bowl Sunday.The "Mighty Mondays"The Patriots are always great at beer, so it's no surprise they also have a beer garden. That's where fans can try several of Seattle's craft beers, including the Super Bowl XXXIII Champagne Sour, a $5 beer from Brewery Ommegang.The Seahawks are no stranger to the Super Bowl. Their home field is CenturyLink Field, where they're always playing in big games and where they'll always play the Falcons.In Super Bowl XXXIII, the Seahawks beat the Broncos 43-8. The beer selection for Super Bowl XLIX is a little different than usual, but it also includes:New England: Three New England IPAs: Sam Adams IPA, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and Avery IPA.Seattle: Widmer's, Stone, and Bell's beersCereal: The Super Bowl is a great time of year to be a cereal lover. Seattle will be offering a new cereal: Big Mouthfuls Snackbar, a brand-new barreled creation from Kashi, which serves up cereal bars at sports events.BeveragesThe Patriots and Seahawks are two teams that play in iconic stadiums, so beer is always on the menu.	0
Dozens of whales are dead after they got stuck on a remote beach in New Zealand, authorities said Monday. The 39 long-finned pilot whales became stranded overnight on Farewell Spit, a narrow claw of land that juts out into the sea from ‌New Zealand’s southwest coast. It was the worst mass deaths of whales in three decades. The mass deaths are the result of an unusual combination of factors, including a cold snap and a mass feeding frenzy. The Department of Conservation (DOC) said the dead whales were part of the northern right whale population. The species is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. "It’s a very severe mass mortality of these whales that we haven’t seen in the last three decades," said DOC spokeswoman Emily Latta. "They’re in a very hard-to-reach part of New Zealand. The whale populations have been decimated by fishing and by commercial whaling, but this is the first mass mortality in the northern right whales in 30 years." As the blubber, blubber, blubber of long-finned pilot whales get their nutrients from a rich diet, there's a massive energy surplus. The surplus of energy is what makes the whales vulnerable, Latta said. "And so the whales get stuck."In the last three decades, scientists have observed the northern right whales migrating and breeding in the southern hemisphere, Latta said. The first documented northern right whales were sighted in the early 1900s. When the mammals arrived on NZ’s shores, they had already experienced huge losses in numbers and populations. In the late 1940s, the population that fed off New Zealand waters was estimated to be about 1,000 animals. By the late 1970s, the northern right whales had recovered to 2,400 animals. The population steadily declined until the early 1980s. The population was then estimated at 2,000 animals. From 1985 to 1996, the number of northern right whales in the southern ocean dropped from 1,500 to around 500. There was another population of northern right whales that was still breeding off the coast of the South Island at the time, Latta said. "This population of whales was probably one of the largest right whales breeding populations in the world," she said.Latta said the most recent census of the southern right whales was conducted in 2001. The southern right whales could not be	0
The sisters of a Los Angeles woman found dead in Cancun, Mexico, in April want the U.S. government to explain why her husband has not been arrested a month after Mexican prosecutors requested his extradition. "We are tired of waiting," Jeanne Burgos said Thursday. "It's not fair." She and her sister Carla Burgos staged a rally outside the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon to demand an arrest. "We are demanding that the United States authorities just do what they have to do," Burgos said. "We are not asking for anything beyond what their duties are." Reality TV producer Bruce Beresford-Redman is still living free with his children in Los Angeles nearly two months after a Mexican judge ordered his arrest. Mexican officials said June 23 that they had sent their extradition petition to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the Justice Department in Washington would confirm what has happened with the extradition request. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, who would pursue an arrest, said Thursday that nothing has been filed in California. "They are not telling us anything," said Allison Triessl, the Burgos family's lawyer. "We have repeatedly asked. We have made phone calls almost daily, and we have received no information at all." Beresford-Redman was briefly detained after his wife's body was found April 8 in a sewer at Cancun's Moon Palace Resort. His passport was taken by investigators, and he was told not to leave Mexico until the inquiry was concluded. Quintana Roo state Attorney General Francisco Alor said in May that he has a "very concrete" case against the former "Survivor" producer. Beresford-Redman's lawyer, Richard Hirsch, has said he would fight extradition. Beresford-Redman returned home in May, without the knowledge of investigators, to take care of family business and see his two young children, his lawyer said. His parents have temporary legal custody of the children, ages 3 and 5, but they are staying with Beresford-Redman. The initial investigation suggested that Monica Beresford-Redman "died of strangulation, because of the bruising," Mexican regional police spokesman Adrian Cardena said.	1
Mexican authorities on Saturday arrested four men in connection with last week's shooting death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in San Diego County, California, Mexico's state-run news agency Notimex reported. U.S. Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas was fatally shot Thursday night in California, U.S. authorities said. Mexican federal police identified the men as human smugglers, and said they were in the act of transporting 21 immigrants when they were detained in the northwest state of Baja California, Notimex said. At a news conference, federal police identified two of the suspects as brothers Jose Eugenio Quintero Ruiz, 49, and Jose Evodio Quintero Ruiz, 43. The other two arrestees were taxi drivers Antonio Badallares Zepeda, 57 and Jose Alfredo Camacho Penuela, 34, Notimex reported. Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas was shot and killed Thursday night while responding to a potential incursion into the United States in the Campo area in San Diego County, U.S. authorities said. The Mexican federal police did not offer specific evidence of the suspects' role in the killing, but said intelligence reports indicated the group was responsible for kidnappings, rapes and murders of several people who tried to cross to the United States, Notimex said. The men were wanted by American authorities, police said. Notimex said that during his interrogation, Jose Eugenio Quintero told investigators the shooter was Ernesto Parra Valenzuela, a man arrested the day before by local police in Tecate, Mexico. Rosas, who is survived by his wife and two young children, had been a border agent for three years. Rosas was the ninth Border Patrol agent to be killed while on duty since 2006, according to the agency's Web site. Two agents died in a vehicle wreck in 2006, and four died in 2007, including two who died in vehicle wrecks, a third who drowned and a fourth who suffered a heart attack while pursuing undocumented immigrants. Two agents died on duty last year, the Border Patrol said. One died in a single-vehicle wreck; another was struck and killed by a vehicle driven by a suspected smuggler, according to the agency's Web site.	1
Israeli rescuers pulled a 22-year-old man from the ruins of a three-story building on Friday, 10 days after the massive earthquake killed tens of thousands of people. The man, who was not immediately identified, was rescued near the quake-ravaged presidential residence south of the capital, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Maj. Zohar Moshe said American and French doctors asked for the Israeli team's assistance after trying to rescue the trapped man themselves. The rescuers "were able to release him whole and healthy" and take him to an IDF field hospital in stable condition for further treatment," he said. Rescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds, including a 7-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl who were found Tuesday. Another 5-year-old boy, Monley, was pulled alive from rubble nearly eight days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had leveled much of Port-au-Prince. More than 121 people have been pulled alive from the rubble, the United Nations said this week. Fires are expected to flare up in the quake's aftermath, from broken mains and other damage. A massive blaze consumed a textile factory in Port-au-Prince Friday night as U.N. workers tried to contain the flames and spare nearby buildings. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Meanwhile, aftershocks from the 7.0-magnitude quake have become a way of life for people here as they spend their days searching for food, water and shelter. Haitians brace for each aftershock as they wait for supplies and sustenance to reach them. More than $355 million in donations in the United States alone has been raised for the relief effort, but stacks of aid -- baby formula, pain medication, antibiotics and other much-needed supplies -- are sitting on the tarmac and in warehouses at the airport in Port-au-Prince, the capital. What is reaching the hands of survivors is getting there at a snail's pace. "It's a shame, because you would hope that everything could get out there within seconds," Air Force Col. Ben McMullen told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, at the airport. "But that kind of infrastructure just isn't in place." Full coverage | Twitter updates Each new aftershock -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- slows down the relief effort even further.	1
Since the December 14 mass killing in Connecticut, we've seen a lot of finger pointing. Too many guns. Not enough guns. Powerful lobbyists. Insufficient mental health services. Discussion of possible explanations is often neither civil nor constructive, and based on a closed-minded and entrenched belief that those who disagree with us have their facts wrong. The victims in Sandy Hook, Aurora and Fort Hood -- all killed or wounded by gun violence -- deserve better. There are two major ways we can zero in on facts and foster a more informed discussion. The first is to further develop and meaningfully consider high quality scientific research on violence prevention and mental health. The second is to create more opportunities for public policy discussions that incorporate this research. Politics: New Congress, new push for gun laws The scientific literature regarding violence prevention is considerable. Yet important research that focuses on gun violence has been shut down for political purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once considered gun violence a public health issue. The science agency had the freedom to ask important questions: Does having a gun in the home make a family safer? Do concealed carry laws increase or reduce gun fatalities? But in 1996, the National Rifle Association pressured its many supporters in Congress to put the squeeze on the CDC by cutting funding that went to gun research, with the stipulation: "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Gun-related research ground to a halt. In 2009, scientists funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism looked into whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of being shot in an assault. In 2011, Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg inserted a provision into a funding bill that extended the CDC restrictions to the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services, ending that similar research. Even Obamacare has been touched by the NRA: The new health care law restricts doctors' ability to collect data about patients' gun use. "Criticizing research is fair game," Drs. Arthur Kellermann and Frederick Rivara wrote in opposition in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month. "Suppressing research by targeting its sources of funding is not."	1
While forecasters predicted cooler days ahead for some of the United States, millions endured sizzling temperatures Saturday, with St. Louis marking its 10th consecutive day of 100 degrees and higher. A cold front was expected to bring much-needed relief in communities baking in a lingering heat wave. The front was to move across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes on Saturday, and into Ohio and the northeast the following day, bringing significantly cooler air, according to the National Weather Service. An excessive heat warning ended in the Chicago area. Despite the cold front, temperatures could remain high until Sunday. The heat wave has left scores dead and hundreds of thousands without power. Saturday's high of 107 in St. Louis broke a 103-degree mark set in 1936, said Butch Dye, hydrometeorologist technician for the National Weather Service. But conditions were expected to improve somewhat Sunday, with a high in the lower to mid-90s. Monday's expected 89 will match the normal high, said Dye. Temperatures topped 100 degrees Saturday in a swath stretching from south-central Iowa to the Chicago area to Louisville, Kentucky, to Virginia, the weather service said. Saturday's highs included 106 in Louisville; 105 in Lexington, Kentucky; 104 in Richmond, Virginia; 104 in Nashville, Tennessee; and 101 in Reading, Pennsylvania. A 4-month-old girl in Greenfield, Indiana, died after being left in a car for an "extended period of time," police Chief John Jester said. While it wasn't clear how hot it had been inside the car, temperatures in that community of 20,000 people reached 103 degrees. The baby's grandfather found the young girl and rushed her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her father, Joshua Stryzinski, was later arrested and charged with neglect of a dependent, resulting in death. Jester said that charge may change after detectives meet with prosecutors. About 25 miles northwest in the town of Fishers, Meg E. Trueblood was arrested for felony neglect of a dependent after her 16-month-old unattended daughter was pulled from a car at a shopping center, police said. The toddler was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, said police spokesman Tom Weger. The temperature inside the vehicle was 124 degrees, said Weger, adding the baby was inside it for about one hour. An officer broke a window to reach the little girl.	1
As someone who has had the great honor of commanding four different ships for the United States Coast Guard, I have watched the news about the Costa Concordia -- the grounding of the vessel and the resulting death of at least 11 people -- from the perspective of a seagoing captain. We must all await the findings of a proper investigation, but for anyone remotely familiar with a captain's awesome responsibilities for the lives of his passengers and crew, the reported behavior of the Concordia's skipper, Francesco Schettino, is almost unfathomable. The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world. The ocean is a dangerous place, where life and death decisions often need to be made in an instant. For this reason, a sea captain is granted complete independence, power, and control aboard his vessel. But with that absolute authority comes absolute responsibility. In the case of a cruise ship, thousands of passengers have come aboard with the expectation that they are in the hands of a competent crew headed by a competent captain. They are depending on his professionalism, skill and dedication to his one and only mission: to navigate his vessel safely and prudently from point A to point B. To meet that mission, a modern sea captain is provided with all kinds of resources. He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding. He is given extraordinary electronic gadgetry that allows him to fix his position on the globe within inches. He receives all sorts of input information -- weather reports, charts detailing virtually every hazard in his area of operation, and detailed information on pathways to take and pathways to avoid -- all of which arm him to make good judgments as to where he is going. The captain of the Costa Concordia had all these resources at his disposal, and yet audio recordings and other accounts appear to show him violating every commonly accepted notion of how a captain will behave in a crisis. First, he came in close to the island in spite of the obvious navigational challenges that meant in terms of safe passage. It is a captain's responsibility to err on the side of safety. When I commanded Coast Guard cutters undertaking hazardous military missions, I invariably chose the safer path whenever I had the opportunity to do so. The captain of a cruise ship, whose sole mission is the safe transport of your passengers, has no excuse to choose anything but the safest path.	1
Police are investigating whether or what family issues  might have prompted a California man to shoot six of his family members -- killing five -- before committing suicide. His wife was  shot and critically injured.The gunman is identified as Gary Martin, 38, of Escalon, in Sonoma County. Five children, two of them stillborn, and four of his siblings survived his attack, local television reported.Martin lived with his wife, Kimberly Martin and their two children, whom authorities said were not injured.The family was returning from a trip, authorities said, when Martin opened fire.Officials said that Kimberly was struck several times during the shooting attack between the couple's home in the 6000 block of Hwy. 1 and their vehicle a few miles away. She was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.Authorities said the gunman was an Army reservist who has been deployed to Iraq, though they offered no further details about his military service.No one else is believed to have been injured, but some family members said the children were traumatized by the ordeal."We had to talk to them about it after, because they were scared of the neighborhood," said one brother, who said the gunman seemed depressed several times during the shooting."I didn't see him go out that door. I think he was in here watching a movie," the brother said."He just shot everybody up," another brother said.Several neighbors said they saw two bodies, which police also confirmed were those of the children, in the family's driveway.Police said there is no evidence Martin or the children had any contact with anyone outside the home.The dead were:Kimberly Martin, 58, of Berkeley, killed in the attackJohn Martin, 39, of Escalon, killed in the attackEthan Martin, 4, of Berkeley, who was born alive but died without ever developingJohn Martin, Jr., 2, of Berkeley, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the headSara Martin, 17, of Berkeley, who was shot and killed in the attackGary Martin, 38, of Escalon, who died in the attack while hiding in a crawl spaceKareem Martin, 10, of Escalon, who was shot in the headJermaine Martin, 9, of Berkeley	0
It was a Cinderella story taken straight from the script of a Disney classic. On Friday, Charlie Beljan thought he was dying at the Magnolia Golf Course in Florida, with his professional golf career also about to take a potentially fatal blow . But two days later the American rookie was celebrating his first victory on the U.S.-based circuit, retaining his Tour card for 2013 after a win at the appropriately named Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Beljan was taken to hospital after Friday's second round suffering from an elevated heart rate and numbness in his left arm after finishing the day's round as leader of the tournament. Ignoring advice from doctors to rest, Beljan played on over the weekend and carded a three-under-par round of 69 on Sunday, which secured him a two-shot victory over compatriot Matt Every. As Beljan celebrated with his seven-week old son on the 18th green a band played "Zippity-Do-Dah" -- from the 1946 Disney "Song of the South" -- and a wonderful day for the Arizona native was complete. "Every day I drove underneath that Disney sign coming in here that said, 'Where dreams come true,' and that's just what happened this week," the 28-year-old told the PGA Tour's official website. "And I'm so grateful and so honored." The win means Beljan will not have to navigate the PGA Tour's offseason qualifying school. "It was incredible," Beljan said after picking up the eighth win of his pro career. "I was happy that I was a PGA Tour champion. I was happy that my wife and my baby were here. It still isn't real." The good news kept coming for Beljan, who also pocketed a winner's check for $846,000. "You never know what's going to happen in this game or in the game of life," he added. "You keep plugging away." "I believe that everything happens for a reason, and sometimes days like Friday weren't very enjoyable, but the score was wonderful, and I think it taught me that it doesn't matter about your golf swing or your putting stroke." "I was literally fighting for my life and I just think that you can't ever give up."	1
A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a "serial rapist" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews. Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how "flawed" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, "Carry That Weight," as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a "serial rapist" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz "transform her personal vendetta" into a "Columbia-sponsored calumny" by supporting "Carry That Weight" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through "this outrageous display of harassment and defamation." Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. "This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful." The defendants "had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims.	1
The goals President Barack Obama set out Tuesday in his Climate Action Plan -- including cutting pollution from coal plants and aggressively pursuing clean energy alternatives -- won't solve all the challenges of climate change, but they are a big first step in protecting the planet from its worst effects. Getting serious about solutions is critically important, especially now and especially for the United States. Why the rush? Climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat-trapping gases, especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide, which have been pumping out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. How much? Through 2012, that total is about 1,700 billion tons of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and cutting down forests. In 2012, carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. were 19.4 tons per person or about 750 pounds per person per week. Per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. may be lower now than they were in 1990, but the average American still emits three times the global average. Global annual carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow rapidly, with emissions in 2012 more than 50% above 1990 levels. Recently, and for the first time in more than 2 million years, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbed above 400 parts per million, 37% higher than in 1800. The resulting global warming, about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, will persist for at least 1,000 years. With every passing year, the pool of total carbon dioxide emissions grows bigger, causing more warming -- and more warming leads to greater damages from climate, weather extremes like heat waves, heavy rainfall, and coastal storm surge, as well as altered crop yields, threats to human health, and increased risks of wildfire. The first step? Address the root of the issue, and this is why the action Obama outlined is smart. The plan recognizes the breadth of the problem and focuses on a wide range of emissions sources. It also recognizes that not all the damages can be avoided and that building resilience needs to be a part of the package.	1
The Army and Marine Corps are allowing convicted felons to serve in increasing numbers, newly released Department of Defense statistics show. A U.S Marine keeps a watchful eye in downtown Baghdad. Recruits were allowed to enlist after having  their criminal record expunged.NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The federal government is preparing to expand the number of people who can enlist in the U.S. military.At least 16 new active-duty Marine barracks, Army installations and Air Force bases are slated to open, according to the Army.At least 13 of the new bases are located in Texas, nine in Delaware and another in New Jersey, according to the Army.The recruits are all people who have been convicted of a felony offense and whose expungement of their record took place after Oct. 1, 2001, the last day the Department of Military Justice's (DMJ) court system accepted any felony offenses for pardons or expungements, according to the Army.The other recruits are convicted felons who have not been able to get their convictions expunged because the DMJ does not accept their cases.Military recruiting at some of these new facilities was temporarily halted in 2007, according to the Army. However, the Army is expected to resume recruiting at these facilities starting on Jan. 1, 2009, the Army said."We are going to continue to aggressively recruit throughout the year and look forward to even more new barracks being built this year at the new installations," Lt. Gen. Robert B. Schmidle, commanding general of the Army recruiting command, said in a statement.The new recruiting effort comes in the wake of an unsuccessful push by the Pentagon to increase the number of recruits from 18,000 to 22,500. The Pentagon's original plan suggested that 22,300 new recruits would be added each year in a phased approach, beginning in fiscal 2008.Currently, the Army has 18,500 active-duty soldiers.However, the U.S. Marine Corps has already started increasing its ranks, and a number of Army and Air Force bases in the United States are expected to open in the years ahead.About 20,000 active-duty Marines and sailors are currently on active duty, according to the Army, and it recently put out a request for proposals for a new recruit training facility at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas.	0
Were nine attractive young Turkish women duped and imprisoned in a villa by Internet soft-core porn peddlers? Or did they simply call in the police to help them break their contract with an Internet contest similar to the reality ute-based show "My Kitchen Rules"? A new documentary asks the right questions regarding the women's case and what really happened in order to get to the bottom of this mystery.The FilmBased on the book "Silk Road: The Secret History of the Internet", author David K. Liu's investigation explores the relationship and evolution of Internet pornography alongside the growth of a global underground culture of erotica in Turkey that was thriving until the day of the scandal, which took place in 2008.Featuring a stellar cast of international film actors — including Julia Stiles (Pulp Fiction) as Seda's sister Sibel; Sibel's father, Efe (The Grand Budapest Hotel), the owner of the house where the eight women lived; and Sibel's husband, Ahmet (The King's Speech), the chief of the police who investigated the case — the documentary takes viewers through the seedy underworld of Internet pornography, the history of the relationship between the Internet and pornography, and reveals the origins of the scandal, as well as an investigation into the police investigation that led to the arrest and conviction of the eight women.The DVDThe DVD of this special presentation of "Silk Road" includes a 60-minute documentary, The Silk Road: The History of the Internet, a 75-minute documentary, The Silk Road: Porn Culture in Turkey, and a bonus audio commentary track with David K.

Greek leftist leader Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday laid out the radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister, including the cancellation of severe budget-cutting measures forced on the country by international ills such as the sovereign debt crisis, as well as the return to Greece of foreign creditors who have abandoned it.Tsipras, a socialist, told a gathering of left-wing intellectuals in the northern town of Thessaloniki that the “unfolding drama” of the Greek society was best seen in the context of the austerity measures imposed under the Troika -- the IMF, European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission.He said that, for the first time in the history of Greece, a left-wing government would have to take “the hard decisions” that would “in the end” restore confidence in Greece’s economy.“Our policies are going to have to have their limits,” Tsipras said, adding: “Our way of life is not sustainable.”His speech in the framework of a meeting of intellectuals called “Bread and the Future” is also a strong endorsement of Greece’s foreign creditors and a call to end the austerity drive imposed by the troika and to return the Greek people to democracy.Tsipras is set to be sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece on Wednesday, after the European Union agreed to his deal with the troika.The country was plunged into crisis two years ago after the collapse of its last three governments.Tens of thousands of Greeks took to the streets and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras; then a new government was formed to form a new coalition in order to tackle the deficit.Tsipras was voted first in the European elections in May, but still needs to secure support from other parties to form a government.Since the crisis began the Greek economy has lost 30 percent of its GDP and unemployment has reached 27 percent.‘We wanted more concessions’In his address, Tsipras laid out a radical economic program that would scrap the country’s harsh austerity measures.“I will not accept the idea that the people of Greece have to pay for the mistakes of those who took power by imposing austerity measures,” said Tsipras, who is on second	0
I wonder if black people would be still in the fields picking cotton today if the 13th Amendment -- the one abolishing slavery -- was placed on the ballot back in 1865. I wonder if Hillary Clinton would be at home baking cookies instead of serving as secretary of state if women's suffrage was put to a vote back in 1919. In other words, I wonder just how far along we would be as a society if the oppressive majority held all of the legislative and judicial power over the oppressed minority, essentially yanking the teeth out of Congress and the Supreme Court. I'm sure you've heard a lot about the gay agenda, but may not know what's in it. Here's what you do: Download a copy of the United States Constitution, read it. Everything the LGBT community wants is in there. Sounds like an oversimplification? It's not. TED.com: What you don't know about marriage There's not a single issue regarding the LGBT community that has been covered in the media or deliberated in courts that is counter to the articles of the Constitution. On the other hand, the fact that in 29 states it is legal to fire someone just because they're gay flies in the face of the 14th amendment, particularly the passage that says "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." That may not be consistent with one's religion, and that's fine. But the Bible and the Constitution are not the same thing. I can't think of a single major civil rights victory that came by way of a general election and so I am not surprised that all 32 states that have voted on marriage equality, voted against marriage equality. It is human nature to resist change, especially change that may bring significant inconvenience to the vast majority of the people, those who are enjoying the spoils of the status quo. "If it's not broke, don't fix it," was never said by the community that was demanding their rights. TED.com: Will our kids be a different species? It was always the mantra of those who liked their slaves; who liked their women barefoot and pregnant; who felt uncomfortable working next to someone with cerebral palsy; who get squeamish at the thought of two men falling in love.	1
Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the WGC-CA Championship but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the Blue Monster course at Doral  which gave him his first birdie of the week. He started a run on the first hole with a drive from 10 feet down the middle of the fairway and almost hit the green. He then took a penalty drop and hit the fairway into the rough and finished with an inside-in layup.

Based on Mick Jagger's serious expression and Keith Richards' focused stare, it was clear the pressure was on. It was the summer of 1972, and the Rolling Stones were on their American concert tour for their acclaimed "Exile on Main Street" album. But when they were not onstage and rocking out with their fans, they were hard at work remixing tracks at the Sunset Sound studio in Hollywood. It was a heady time filled with parties and recording sessions and only one person was there to capture it all intimately -- famed music photographer Jim Marshall, who was covering the tour for Life magazine. Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15. There will also be a show at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from July 5 to September 8, and an exhibit at EMP Museum in Seattle, opening on July 14. Some of these frames are being displayed exclusively on the CNN Photos blog. The release couldn't have had better timing as the Rolling Stones recently announced plans to mark their 50th anniversary this year. Amelia Davis, a photographer who worked as Marshall's assistant, is the sole owner of Jim Marshall Photography. (Marshall died in 2010.) Working with Marshall to archive his work allowed her to listen to Marshall's many stories and delve into his memories. Davis told CNN that what made Marshall's shots unique was that he always demanded total access to the rock stars. "He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage," Davis said. "He always had his camera with him. People ignored the camera in a sense. It was an extension of him. He had the ability to be a fly on the wall." Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said. "It really set the precedent for the rock star concert tour," she said. "They had their own plane, lots of drugs, lots of alcohol. It was just crazy. There was a lot going on." Davis said that Marshall's strong personality, fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as Richards.	1
At last. The 77-year itch has been scratched, history has been rewritten and the yearning is no longer. Perhaps now -- after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon for what seemed an eternity, Andy Murray will finally feel loved. A straight sets victory over Novak Djokovic in the final was accomplished with the grit and vigor for which this champion is renowned -- but it is his softer side which has endeared him to the wider world. Just 12 months ago, Murray stood on Centre Court and cried. He cried tears of pain and anguish -- showing a part of himself of which very few ever knew existed following his final defeat. "It feels slightly different to last year," Murray told fans on Centre Court. "Last year was one of the toughest moments of my career, so to manage to win the tournament today. "It was an unbelievably tough match, so many long games. "My head was everywhere in that last game, he was hitting some unbelievable shots and I think that is why at the end of the match I almost didn't know what had happened. "The last 30 minutes have been a bit a bit of a blur. I just don't know what to say." Turning point That defeat in the final to Roger Federer was a turning point -- not just in Murray's career, but in his relationship with British tennis fans. He was human. He did feel. He was no longer the angry, skinny, and grumpy teenager which had always threatened but never quite delivered. No, this time the British public knew they had someone special. As those tears streamed down his face, the nation finally realized that this was a man who just desperately wanted to give the country what it wanted -- a Wimbledon champion. Fast-forward 12 months and with the U.S. Open title already in the bag and the experience of winning Olympic gold on the very same court, Murray produced his finest hour. A straight sets victory over World No.1 Djokovic is an astonishing achievement -- more so given the level of pressure heaped on Murray around this time of year. Murray is all too aware of the history. Not since Fred Perry won the last of his three titles in 1936 had a British man won the singles tournament at Wimbledon.	1
There's no evidence the heated political environment played any role in the shooting spree that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in critical condition and killed six others, but observers say if nothing else, the tragedy will force politicians to re-evaluate their rhetoric. Militant-themed messages and speeches laced with fear have marked recent dialogue in Washington and on the campaign trail, but in the aftermath of the massacre in Arizona, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on their colleagues to tone it down. "An event like this really ought to make us rethink the way we speak to each other every day about politics and policy in the country, especially in the Congress," said Thomas Benson, professor of rhetoric at Penn State University. The night before Saturday's shooting in Tucson, Arizona, Giffords issued a new call for more civility in politics. She sent an e-mail to outgoing Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a Republican, that included a remark about the need to "tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." Giffords e-mail: Need to 'tone our rhetoric and partisanship down' The suspected shooter's motive is unclear, but Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik was quick to criticize the "vitriolic rhetoric" heard on the radio and television. "That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences," he said Saturday. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's political aide removed a controversial Web post this weekend that featured cross hairs over the congressional districts of 20 Democratic candidates, including Giffords. A Palin aide denied the Web posting from the 2010 congressional campaign was designed to incite violence. Adviser: Linking Palin to shootings 'appalling' Florida conservative radio host Joyce Kauffman took heat after remarking at a Tea Party rally, "If ballots don't work, bullets will." Biting language has also come from those on the left, with Democrats and President Obama pegging Republicans as"hostage takers." Despite all the nastiness, Richard Vatz, professor of political communication at Towson University in Maryland, said the notion that the rhetoric caused the violence is "fallacious." That connection, he said, is born out of recognition that such violent incidents can't be eradicated.	1

Ammerman****September 15, 2007**It was an October afternoon, and the sky over the Great Lakes was the color of burnt sugar. The sun was shining brightly, and there was a chill in the air. A single cold breeze blew in off Lake Michigan, chilling my skin and making my breath fog. I was alone, and had been all day. I was sitting by myself in the living room, thinking about my life and where it might lead me.I was sixty-nine years old; my life had taken a dramatic turn in the past six months. It was the fourth day since my doctor had diagnosed me with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD."I'm going to die, and it's nothing to be frightened about," I declared, thinking that maybe, just maybe, I hadn't been in my apartment too long."What about your husband?" her husband asked.I answered, "I'm not married. I don't have a husband."At that moment, I realized I was not crazy. I was living the last of my life. One afternoon, I had turned a corner on the path that would take me to the end of my life. I was looking forward to a happy retirement, and I had a plan for how I would spend the next forty-five years.What I could never have prepared myself for was the unexpected and sudden death of my husband of only four years. When the unexpected happened, my heart broke, and I cried. I cried for days, and it was hard for him to believe that I no longer existed.

An Iraqi official condemned Friday the decision by a U.S. jury not to sentence a U.S. soldier to death. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green faces life in prison after being convicted of murdering an Iraqi family. "He raped a girl and killed an entire family, and he got only life in prison. ... This is an unjust trial," said Mustafa Kamel Shabib al-Jabouri, leader of the Awakening Council in Yusufiya. "We demand a new trial." Steven Green was found guilty earlier this month of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and of murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister. He was the last of five soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division convicted in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. During Green's trial, relatives of the murder victims gave gripping testimony about how the crimes still haunt them. Some family members said their lives have been ruined and it would have been better if they'd also been killed. Thursday, Green avoided the death penalty when a Kentucky jury could not reach a unanimous decision. Green was tried in civilian court because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes came to light. The three others were tried by a military court and imprisoned. Spc. James Barker, Sgt. Paul Cortez, Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years, with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases. After the trial, defense attorneys called for the military to "take a hard look at the resources they provide our service members dealing with combat stress issues. If they do not, we [are] certain a tragedy like this will occur again in the future." Doug Green, Steven's brother, said he was grateful his brother's life was spared. "I was incredibly relieved," he said. "This is as good as it gets." He also offered an apology. "Our hearts and prayers are with you. We're sorry. We're sorry," he said. "This has been hard for everybody involved. Not just my family, but the Iraqis. Everybody is going to need some healing."	1
White House Ebola czar Ron Klain on Tuesday downplayed the chances of Ebola being used as a biological weapon after a scare in New Zealand. Klain said he was briefed Tuesday after a member of his own staff alerted him to reports that the CDC now considers Ebola the fourth highest priority for a biological attack after anthrax, smallpox and small-arms fire.In January, when a single case was reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- now numbering five -- the World Health Organization raised concerns that the infection could be an intentional biological attack. Klain said Tuesday he remained wary of a biological attack but believed an attack involving Ebola likely wouldn't be intentional.U.S. officials have said for months that the risk of an Ebola-based biological attack in the United States isn't that high."The president has asked the Department of Defense to provide support for the CDC to better understand the threat, and the United States has increased our ability to detect and respond to suspicious events," White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said in a statement."When we get a signal of a potential outbreak and a threat, we will take the appropriate action," Schultz said.The U.S. government's response to such an attack, which could involve hundreds of people, would be "severe and significant," Klain said. If an attack occurred and the public was at risk of contagion, the U.S. government likely would require people to stay indoors for a minimum of 21 days or else seek medical attention."For example, we need to be prepared to quarantine in a manner that is safe and appropriate given the level of harm and suffering and the level of risk to those exposed," Klain said."There would be a quarantine for an extended period of time for those who come in contact with those with the virus," Klain said.The CDC said it was aware of the matter but declined to comment on it Tuesday. "We are aware of reports regarding an Ebola outbreak in Guinea, but we are currently assessing this information and the potential impact it could have on the U.S. response and are sharing it with the appropriate agencies and public health officials within the United States of America,” the CDC said in a statement.A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said he didn't want to comment on the matter because the incident is under review.Klain acknowledged	0
On August 24, a jury of nine in a California federal court handed down a ruling that sent shockwaves through the global wireless phone industry. Samsung, the world's largest phone maker, was found guilty of infringing on key Apple hardware design and software  patents, allowing Apple to demand a $1 billion fine over eight charges. The case was fought out in two massive trials, one in Tokyo and one in San Francisco, over a period of three years, with the Japanese trial alone involving some 600,000 pages of documents and evidence. In the San Francisco trial, the jury convicted Samsung on seven out of the eight charges at the end.The Samsung verdict is important because it is the first of three cases to come out of Apple's protracted legal battle with Samsung in Asia, with Samsung appealing the US verdict on the first of the three cases and it being settled on July 26, 2014. In the event of a retrial that follows the recent San Francisco verdict, the verdict could prove to be a landmark one, but the verdict in Tokyo will have a much more far-reaching impact. On that trial, where the jury was told that Apple would be awarded $1 billion in damages, the jury handed down a not guilty verdict on one patent infringement charge, with the jury in the San Francisco trial finding Samsung guilty of infringement on three patents, all of which relate to Apple's design and software  patents.Despite what the Samsung verdict says about the strength of the US manufacturing sector, the outcome of the case is just one of many trends emerging. The patent infringement litigation landscape is being redefined, as Apple seeks to get a better deal in its protracted case with Samsung in Japan and its case with Huawei in China. What will happen next, with the US and China in conflict over the control of one of the most important business centers in the world, remains to be seen.How Samsung paid for the US trialThe first important question which arises from reviewing the facts about Samsung's strategy in the US is whether Samsung was planning on going to trial, as Apple claims, or whether it has already filed a lawsuit in a second case over technology that could potentially be at the core of its current infringement case.The answer to this question will be crucial in determining the likely outcome of the trial. If Samsung had already decided to file a lawsuit in the US, as it allegedly did, then it would have had to pay Apple $5 billion to acquire that	0
Part of Robert Ferrante's job had been to manage a laboratory that conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals. Until he was accused of using one of those substances -- cyanide -- to kill his wife. On Friday, a Â¼-inch-wide strip of cyanide, or sodium azide, was turned over to authorities. The strip, which was attached to a bag of a chemical that authorities said was also used in the killing, had been used in the case of the first of the couple's four victims."The cyanide was found at the scene of Mrs. Ferrante's death," said Chief Deputy Mark Funkhouser, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "It was part of the evidence collected that led to his arrest for first-degree murder."The death of Ferrante's wife, Karen, was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner's office, which identified the cause of death as "multiple blunt force injuries to the head."Her body was discovered in the living room of their home in Laguna Hills, Calif., on March 9, 2007, the Los Angeles Times reports.Ferrante had told investigators that he was having marital problems. He said that he had been drinking excessively for the two weeks before his wife died.Three more deaths are linked to this case. The first victim, a woman, was stabbed to death on September 24, 2003, the Los Angeles Times reports. The other two victims were found April 22, 2006, in the couple's home.The third victim, a man, was found dead on Wednesday, May 2, 2006. He was the husband of Karen Ferrante, the couple's adopted daughter.Three other victims Â¼-inch strips of cyanide, or sodium azide, have been sent to the medical examiner's office to determine if they are connected to the deaths.Ferrante, 55, had been held since July. He was initially convicted of the 2006 murder of his wife in a separate trial on the basis that it was in self-defense. However, the case against Ferrante stalled after the prosecution declined to accept the defense's arguments, said the Times.Ferrante told the FBI he killed his wife because she was having an affair."We can't go on, it's over," he told investigators, according to the Times	0
A Southwest Airlines jetliner sustained substantial damage when its nose gear collapsed during landing in New York and it skidded down the runway, injuring 10 people. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday that the extent of damage to the Boeing 737-700 prompted it to launch a full investigation of Monday's incident at LaGuardia airport. "When the nose wheel collapsed it didn't just neatly fold back up there but it produced collateral damage in the nose wheel well," safety board spokesman Eric Weiss told CNN. Separately, Southwest reached out to Flight 345 passengers, some of whom reported chaos and confusion in the cabin as the plane slid down 7,000-foot Runway 4 with its nose scraping the tarmac. Airline officials, in e-mails obtained by CNN, apologized for the "unexpected experience" and inconvenience and expressed concern for their well being. Southwest is refunding air fares and sending them complimentary tickets for future travel. Southwest, the largest domestic airline, did not respond to efforts by CNN to confirm the e-mails. Passengers recounted the final harrowing moments of what had been a delayed, but uneventful flight from Nashville. Kathy Boles, a passenger, said a "strong jolt" shook the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac at about 5:40 p.m. ET. "It was just a bang and a bounce, and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling," Boles told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360Â°." "I feel extremely blessed to have come off that," she said. "It just really felt like the plane could have broken in half, it was such a hard impact." Fellow passenger Anastasia Elliot said the situation was "pretty chaotic." "We hit the ground pretty hard and slid," she said. "There was a lot of smoke filling the plane, just a lot of smoke and burnt rubber." Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop. "Everything in the plane that was loose went flying forward," Bill Roland said. "There were cell phones, iPads, books (and) drinks all skidded up." Passengers escaped the plane down emergency chutes. LaGuardia flight delays related to the incident impacted the morning rush as crews removed the disabled twin-engine jet from the edge of the runway where it came to rest. It was towed to a hangar.	1
After receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem, which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries. The stuck urns have been reported in Ford Explorers, the company's midsize SUV, as well as Ford vehicles with a single engine.“I would urge the company to immediately fix the problem, and to make this the first step in addressing the issue,” said U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who along with U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster and U.S. Reps. John Shimkus and Mike Turner have written the letter to company CEO Alan Mulally calling for action.The letter urged Ford to “identify the root cause of the problem and promptly correct it.”It also urged the automaker to work with regulators to ensure “a safe and reliable recall” that could save lives.Ford blamed the problem on improper calibration of an electronic throttle control device. The automaker, however, said earlier in the investigation that it is not aware of any incidents that could be directly linked to the calibration issue.The investigation has found that a malfunctioning “calibration switch” caused the urns to stick open, Ford said.A Ford spokesperson said the automaker is working with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to investigate the defect.“NHTSA is taking the issues raised by the public seriously, and will evaluate the findings and take the appropriate actions as it determines actions to address the issues,” the spokesperson said.However, NHTSA’s probe also found that the urns could be improperly wired to the vehicles’ dashboard controls, possibly resulting in a loss of functionality.When it reported the defect to NHTSA earlier this month, Ford said the urn problem is a “manufacturing-related issue,” and said its investigation into the defect will continue.“We are doing what we can to work with NHTSA and other government entities to ensure the safety of our customers and the public,” Ford said in the statement. “We also will continue to work with the NHTSA to address issues raised throughout this month’s safety investigation.”	0
All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison. Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general. In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons "may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch." Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested "solely with the governor." "We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case, and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome," Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority. But in the cases before them, it was up to the governor to " decide whether the Constitution's publication requirement was met." In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision "a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state." Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed, each day, for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed. But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was "an unconstitutional encroachment" on the governor's power. Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter. "We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families. It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won," he said in a statement, echoing Randolph's dissent. Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as "trusties" at the governor's mansion. Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them.	1
Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m. The 26-year-old finalized his protracted move on Monday after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical, making it the biggest English transfer so far during the January window. Cahill has signed a five-and-a-half year contract with the London club, despite doubts beginning to surface about the deal due to the length of time negotiations over his financial terms took. Who are football's top January transfer targets? He told the official Chelsea website: "Chelsea are a massive club. They look to win trophies season in season out and it is a big opportunity for me to be a part of that. "Opportunities like this, you just can't turn down," added Cahill, who has won seven England caps and will be battling with Brazilian David Luiz to partner England captain John Terry at the heart of the Chelsea defense. Speaking on Saturday about Cahill's impending arrival, Chelsea manager Andre Villas Boas told reporters: "He has good technical abilities which is important in the way we want to play and to implement our philosophy. "Competition will be tight for him but we brought him in to become better as a team." Cahill joined Bolton from Aston Villa in January 2008 and developed into one of England's top defenders during his four years at the Reebok Stadium. However, he had already indicated he was not prepared to sign a new contract, meaning Wanderers were forced to sell him or lose him for free at the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Carlos Tevez transfer saga has taken a new twist after Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti confirmed the Italian club had made a $31.7 million bid for Manchester City's Argentine striker. Speaking to reporters after Inter's 1-0 victory over city rivals AC Milan, Moratti said: "Our offer is 25 million euros -- now it depends on them whether they accept it or not." Inter have emerged as favorites to sign Tevez, after Milan pulled out of the race last week when their plan to sell Alexandre Pato to Paris St Germain fell through following the Brazilian's decision to stay at the San Siro.	1
First, there was the war on drugs. Then came the war on terrorism. Followed by the war on Christmas, women and religion. We seem to love waging wars. And now a new war has broken out: the war on comedy. This war started just a week ago by those defending Rush Limbaugh's infamous attack on Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown law school student who simply offered an opinion Limbaugh didn't like. So, Limbaugh being the "entertainer" that he is, responded by calling this young woman a "slut" and "prostitute." With Limbaugh under attack for his despicable comments, his supporters launched a desperate counterattack to save him by targeting "liberal" comedians like Bill Maher and Louie C.K. for their crude and demeaning jokes about Sarah Palin. Their point was that Limbaugh may have been bad, but he's not the only one, so he should be forgiven. (I'd love to see a defendant in a murder trial try this defense.) Thus, the war on comedy was on. The hostilities escalated late last week when Fox News' Greta Van Susteren called for a boycott of the Congressional Correspondents' dinner because Louie C.K. was slated to host the event. (C.K. dropped out of hosting the dinner shortly after the controversy erupted.) I'm not really sure why Limbaugh's defenders launched this war on comedians. Limbaugh does not even consider himself a comedian; instead, he's referred to as an "entertainer," which is the same label often used to describe strippers. (No offense intended to strippers.) In any event, Maher and C.K. were under attack for having crossed the line that comedians are forbidden to transgress. So, here is the big question: What exactly is the line that comedians are prohibited from breaching? What type of joke crosses from killing the crowd to killing your career? To me, the answer depends on two factors. Are you a famous comedian? And what type of joke is it?	1
If the location is anything to go by, then the omens are promising. Denmark's capital city, Copenhagen -- host to the U.N. climate summit which starts today -- is already one of the greenest cities in Europe. With over 300 Â“green buildingsÂ” in Copenhagen, the city has a target for installing 1.5 million by 2030.But the climate summit is also a chance to turn this into a real world challenge. The conference will launch two new global initiatives, a global partnership and a commitment to 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030. Copenhagen City Council is now launching a Copenhagen Pledge, a promise to commit 100 per cent to renewable energy -- and is also leading the way towards a commitment for 100 per cent of all households to be powered by an energy source other than oil, gas and coal by 2030, which is a world-first.The city council, which has also pledged to implement an ambitious green development strategy and to close its carbon emissions, hopes to inspire Copenhageners to make similar promises around the world as we move towards a cleaner, brighter future.The Danish capital is leading the charge and will be in the front row of this race to decarbonize and to embrace sustainable development in all its forms.On May 26th, Copenhagen will host the global climate negotiations which start today, and will continue until Saturday. The United Nations will be holding the meeting -- and Copenhagen City Council is not only leading in the fight for climate action at home, but also at the U.N. conference.In Copenhagen City Council, we are calling on city leaders around the world to join in this urgent global climate effort. The city council is urging all its city counterparts to get in step and commit to a 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030 target, and to turn their carbon emissions into investments instead.We are launching Copenhagen Pledge, the only global initiative aiming to promote a 100 per cent clean and secure energy by 2030.In addition, we are calling on the city of Copenhagen to lead, first and foremost, by setting ambitious targets for the city, like a 100 per cent target for renewable electricity by 2030, and to also be a global leader in the fight for an ambitious and sustainable development.We are pleased to see Copenhagen and its leaders stepping up to the challenge by committing to a 100 per cent target for renewable electricity.

North Korea's agreement to halt portions of its nuclear and missile programs and accept the return of nuclear inspectors is a "modest step in the right direction," U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. Clinton said, however, that  the North must take concrete actions to halt proliferation and move on with its development of nuclear technology. Read the original story here: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/20/heraldsun/main2/13448345.shtmlBy KATHARINA FRYDOW JONES NEWS, SEPTEMBER 30, 2007WASHINGTON -- The United States and North Korea reached a deal Friday that would end the North's nuclear weapons program and allow an International Atomic Energy Agency assessment of its facilities at a meeting that ended three hours and 30 minutes later than scheduled.The agreement represents a small step in the right direction, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said after her meeting with North Korea's Foreign Minister, Youn Youn at the State Department."It is a modest step in the right direction because it's the right first step," Clinton said Friday afternoon.The agreement between the United States and North Korea is "still far too timid and insufficient to deal with the threat that North Korea poses to the region and to the world," Bush said.Clinton said that while she welcomed Pyongyang's participation in global nuclear talks, she said that North Korea's return of the United States' recently withdrawn nuclear inspectors was an "important step in our efforts to make North Korea more open to the outside community."Clinton said she and Bush also discussed bilateral issues such as the North's decision to allow humanitarian aid groups to fly over the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas."This was a good meeting," she said of the North Korean talks.Clinton acknowledged that her talks on North Korea were with a "small government" in Pyongyang, which has been criticized for heavy-handed repression of its citizens. The United States, on the other hand, has used North Korea as a front in the war on terror.In her comments following the negotiations, Clinton said she was optimistic that U.S.-North Korea relations would further improve during the Bush administration."Today's agreement will give North Korea the time it needs to make critical decisions about its future," Clinton said.

French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris. In a statement on their website, French national police ask for information on the whereabouts of Âmeh Ouchet, 28, a French national who has already been interviewed by French authorities and is known to French intelligence. Police also say they are seeking information on two additional accomplices who allegedly were with Ouchet during the attack.(A photo accompanying this post was used with the permission of the photographer and the photographer’s agent.)SOUNDBITE, French police spokesman, "The two suspects in this incident are still on the run. I would like to emphasize this point, as we are talking about a suspect who has already been interviewed and is known to French intelligence. We need to find them, and we need to find them quickly. These people will be brought to justice."French special forces are believed to have killed more than 40 people after a shooting attack at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday morning. The shootings took place during a morning staff meeting of Charlie Hebdo, according to an unnamed police source quoted on the website of the French newspaper Le Monde. The magazine’s offices have since been sealed off and an investigation into the attack is underway.The dead have mostly been identified by Charlie Hebdo’s current editor, Stephane Charbonnier, who was killed along with five people in a separate attack outside the magazine’s offices just hours earlier.The shootings at the magazine and the killing of Charbonnier, who once told Charlie Hebdo staffers to “take a break,” shocked the world, with French President Sarkozy expressing “shock and grief.”An editorial from an English language version of the French edition of Charlie Hebdo said, “The attack was an organized event. The massacre was a premeditated action, which will also be investigated in the interests of the freedom of expression, as well as the freedom of the press.”The magazine’s current editors, who also edited the Charlie Hebdo that was attacked, have vowed to continue the magazine’s tradition of defending freedom of expression.At least 10 people were killed, and another 39 wounded Wednesday morning in a shooting attack at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, according to police sources quoted	0
The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday. A U.S. Navy photo shows a ship held by pirates off the coast of Somalia in November. The unit -- called Combined Task Force 151 -- is a spinoff of an existing force in the region that addressed a range of security issues, such as drug smuggling and weapons trafficking, as well as piracy. The Gulf of Aden links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. About 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year near largely lawless Somalia. The United States is among at least 20 countries that are trying to combat piracy in the region, including Russia, India, Germany and Iran. In December, German sailors foiled an attempt by pirates to hijack an Egyptian cargo ship off the coast of Yemen, according to the German Defense Ministry, and the European Union launched its first naval operation to protect vessels. That came just days after China revealed its own plans to patrol the Horn of Africa's volatile coastline. Task Force 151 will be devoted solely to counterpiracy efforts, said Lt. Stephanie Murdock, a Fifth Fleet spokeswoman. The United States anticipates other nations joining the force "in the near future." "The problem of piracy is and continues to be a problem that begins ashore and is an international problem that requires an international solution," Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, said in a news release from the Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. "We believe the establishment of CTF-151 is a significant step in the right direction." The financial and human costs of piracy are extensive. Ships ranging from luxury yachts to a Saudi supertanker have been held for ransom. At least one major company pulled its ships from the Gulf of Aden region in 2008, meaning cargo bound for Europe had to round the African continent rather than use the Suez Canal. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » "The pirates are living between life and death," a pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah, told the Somali news organization Garowe Online late last year. CNN obtained the complete interview.	1
An explosion on an oil tanker off the Japanese coast set off a huge fire Thursday and left the vessel's captain missing. Ships and aircraft battled the blaze on the Shoko Maru, a 998-ton tanker anchored about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the port of Himeji in western Japan, the coast guard said. Rescuers have recovered seven members of the eight-person crew, the coast guard said, but the ship's 64-year-old captain is still missing. Four of the rescued crew remembers were seriously injured in the blast, the Himeji fire department said, and all seven of them were taken to hospitals after arriving in the port, which is about 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Osaka on the Seto Inland Sea. The tanker wasn't loaded when the blast went off Thursday morning, the coast guard said, reducing fears of a major environmental disaster. Video footage showed water cannons dousing the stricken ship as large black plumes of smoke rose from a blaze roaring inside its body. Later images showed the tanker scorched, smoldering and listing to one side. There was no immediate danger to other ships, as the tanker was located outside of the port facility, the coast guard said, adding that an exclusion zone was being set up around the damaged vessel. The coast guard said it was still investigating the cause the explosion on the ship, which belongs to Shoho Shopping Co. Ltd, a company based in Hiroshima, Japan. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.	1
Six buses, 40 teams, 48 hours and one winning business idea: The StartupBus is as close to blood sport as Silicon Valley entrepreneurship gets. Part road trip, part code jam, the annual competition plunges participants, known as "buspreneurs,"  into competitive business plans and gives them an outsized, competitive advantage over their competitors. This year, a lucky winner will earn $1 million for each company he or she secures.You'll travel with the StartupBus's four coaches and an entourage of up to 10 other business gurus, all on their laptop screens. One of the coaches will be a former entrepreneur who's turned his experience into a platform for his own companies. Others will be business coaches, experts in business and leadership. There will be a "buspreneurs' corner" with a team of bus drivers and a team of business owners. And there will be a "concern" with a group of people who are trying to make a good business through a more traditional means.And then it's over. As the coaches head home, they pass each other on the road, swapping ideas and learning from each other about how to become an entrepreneur. This is the way we do business in this country. It's how we run businesses here, and the way that we run this country. It's our model of success.I think there's even a place in the world for a StartupBus. In the United States, we've never had a competition to see who is the most entrepreneurial startup. But just as the StartupBus gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to do what they are best at, it allows America to show the rest of the world what it has to offer.In fact, the StartupBus might, just maybe, be the first stepping stone to that great startup nation that I keep hearing about."You need an entrepreneurial society, and there's not one in the world." Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, on The Secret of the Startup Nation. (Photo by Richard Branson)Maybe the best-kept secret in America today is the entrepreneurial mindset—an ability to thrive in an environment that rewards it, rather than punishes it. And if you are an entrepreneur who is looking to be successful, consider the StartupBus a gift.A gift because it provides you with a way to meet with like-minded individuals who will listen to what you have to	0
Federal authorities have filed the first criminal charges in the investigation of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, people briefed on the matter said. Several suspects charged in the armed assault last September 11 include prominent Libyan militia figure Ahmed Abu Khattala, the sources said. Other identities were not disclosed. The counts initially sought months ago in New York are still under seal, according to the sources. The investigation of the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans  continues, these people said, as investigators try to build their case against Khattala and others who authorities believe were involved. If CNN can interview Benghazi suspect, why can't FBI? Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment as did FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald in New York. But word of the development comes as the Justice Department has come in for sharp criticism from congressional lawmakers about the pace and progress of the investigation. Attorney General Eric Holder had earlier this year promised them that the Justice Department would soon make public what actions it would take. Republicans have demanded more aggressive steps from the incoming FBI Director James Comey. But people close to the case said the investigation has moved significantly in recent months. In that time, the FBI has released photos of what it called persons of interest who were present during the attacks, seeking tips from the Libyan public. It couldn't be learned when the United States plans to announce the charges or whether there is any intention to try to detain Khattala or the others. None of those briefed on the matter would discuss the precise counts. Benghazi attack timeline In a recent interview with CNN's Arwa Damon, Khattala acknowledged being at the Benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement. Benghazi has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the Obama administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The investigation is led by agents from the FBI in New York and has included some members of the Washington field office, who have traveled to Libya to interview hundreds of witnesses, those briefed on the investigation said. Khattala told CNN that he had not been questioned by either Libyan authorities or the FBI. U.S. law enforcement officials said it's not unusual for the FBI not to seek to interview defendants in a case while they collect other evidence.	1
A heat wave of historic proportions could strike some Northeastern states as forecasters warn of prolonged triple-digit temperatures that could trigger "a dangerous situation," the National Weather Service advised Monday. The Weather Service has issued an excessive heat advisory for several Northeastern cities to take effect Monday afternoon as humidity levels gradually increase, producing heat index values to persist and surpass 100 degrees. Excessive heat advisories have been issued for the Philadelphia metropolitan area until Wednesday evening, and in New York City, a heat advisory is in effect from to 2 p.m. Monday until 6 p.m. Tuesday as high humidity levels and high temperatures linger for two consecutive days, the Weather Service reported. The increase in humidity, matched by weather patterns, may force the Weather Service to issue additional heat advisories for central New Jersey, northeastern Maryland and central and southern Delaware. The Weather Service advised people affected by the heat to "drink plenty of fluids," stay out of the sun and in air-conditioned rooms, and to check up on relatives and neighbors. iReport: Share your favorite hot weather activities and cool-down tricks New York City residents are advised to call 311 to find cooling centers and obtain "beat the heat" safety instructions, the Weather Service reported. A heat wave is considered to be a stretch of more than 90-degree temperatures. Tuesday is expected to be the hottest day of the stretch, with highs ranging from 100 to 102 degrees and heat index values up to 106, the Weather Service warned. Toronto simmers at sunrise According to the Weather Service, in the 40-year period from 1936 through 1975, nearly 20,000 people were killed in the United States by the effects of heat and solar radiation. And in the heat wave of 1980, more than 1,250 people died, the Weather Service said.	1
Three teenagers from northwest London were released on bail Sunday after their alleged plans to travel to Syria led to their arrest. Two 17-year-olds boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested "on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts," the Metropolitan Police said. The investigation started on Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials on Friday, and that night, the individuals landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped, along with another person who had been regarded as suspicious by Turkish intelligence working at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three arrived back in London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. "When we have intelligence shared with us there is no problem. We stop them and directly deport them. And of course Turkish intelligence is always on the lookout as well," the Turkish official said. Turkey on Thursday arrested a person who worked for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service on suspicion of helping the girls, according to Turkey's foreign minister. On Friday, a Turkish television network aired a video purportedly showing the girls preparing to cross the Turkish border into Syria. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Arwa Damon and Karen Smith contributed to this report.	1
Xavi Hernandez has signed an extended deal with Barcelona that will keep him at the Camp Nou for the rest of his career, the Spanish club have announced. The midfielder's new contract will be The 30-year-old will have a clause in the new deal that will allow him to leave in the summer if he wants to. Barca had been chasing the forward for £200,000-a-week, but they had been forced to come back to Madrid for negotiations after a late approach from La Liga side Levante, who tried to make him a free transfer.However, reports on Thursday night suggested that Los Blancos were trying to get him to leave with the minimum of fuss and that it might be the case that they would only complete the deal if they were able to sign one or two young players during the transfer window.With this news, it looks like Barcelona have done their part by making the deal a lot shorter for Hernandez. The club have done their best by ensuring that he remains at Camp Nou to play for many more years despite his age. They are likely to take advantage of this situation to negotiate new deals for other young players.La Liga champions Real Madrid came close to signing Hernandez from Barcelona back in June on a three-year deal, only to ditch the idea because they felt that they could get the same terms elsewhere.But this could be the end of the chase for Hernandez as he looks likely to remain at Camp Nou until he is 37. The last time he joined the club his contract was up in 2017 and, since then, he has signed a new one running until 2021. He was the first-choice left wing-back when he joined the Spanish giants last summer from the Belgian club Genk and, since that point, every player he has played with has either left or been sold.With Hernandez having two more years to run on his current deal, it looks like Barcelona will be looking to find a replacement for the 25-year-old. However, he is unlikely to be their only target. With the arrival of Neymar to PSG, Barcelona will be looking for a few more midfielders and strikers.This may seem like an odd way to end the search for a signing, but Barcelona have had a number of promising signings this summer that have been bought to compete for places rather than to replace the players who have left.

A former Los Alamos National Laboratory nuclear scientist and his wife were indicted on charges of trying to provide nuclear secrets to Venezuela, Â an indictment first reported in August 2006 by the Los Alamos News.Lane said a federal grand jury in New Mexico indicted him and his wife, who was a senior researcher at the lab, on federal charges relating to the unauthorized disclosure of US nuclear secrets to the Caribbean island nation.The indictment alleges that between 2001 and 2003, the couple made unauthorized downloads of classified files from the lab's computing system that contained information about U.S. nuclear weapons testing, national defense, civilian nuclear facility design and management, defense strategy, radiation monitoring and testing, nuclear weapon design, materials and explosives detection, and national security safeguards, according to a news release from the U.S. Justice Department, which obtained the indictment in March.According to a court document, the couple downloaded the files from the lab's Department of Defense (DoD) Information Network (NIPRNet), which the indictment says was part of an information network with links to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).Lane said that in August and September 2006, he and his wife downloaded classified files from the network in order to prepare a paper to be submitted to a government think tank and to try to influence policymakers because of the nation's growing reliance on nuclear weapons."If I could have saved the country a few billion dollars, there would have been no need to develop nuclear reactors," he allegedly said in a federal court filing.Lane also said in a lawsuit filed by his wife that he was trying to get his name removed from the NIPRNet records database in Washington, D.C., so that his name couldn't be used to further incriminate him in the alleged scheme. But he said one of his former supervisors had told him to make the false statements to the U.S. Department of Justice to get rid of him.He also said in the lawsuit he feared that, if they lived, he and his wife would be jailed or deported to Venezuela.Lane said in the suit that his wife was also trying to persuade the NIPRNet personnel to remove him from the database, but one of NIPRNet personnel denied having any knowledge of the couple's activities and accused them of using excessive computing	0
After nearly 40 years of recorded increases, the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008, recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show. The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased, partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election. According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008, down from 12.6 percent in 2007. Taking into account the margin of error, it was possible that the immigrant population remained even. "Between '07 and '08 there really wasn't that much of a change," said Elizabeth Grieco, chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau. But given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970, no change is big news. The American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year, and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population, according to the bureau. The survey doesn't give a reason for the leveling off, but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift. "The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants' decisions on whether to come to the U.S.," said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Would-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now, Mittelstadt said. The largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession, including California, Florida and Arizona. Mittelstadt noted, however, that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying. A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico, the largest source of immigrants to the United States, slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures. The Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008, according to census data. The new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005, the number of noncitizens decreased, Grieco said. There were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008, down from 21.9 million in 2007. The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants.	1
My mother, Ms. Nippy Carville, was a woman of many talents. Two in particular stand out. She was a superb cook (the author of a successful cookbook), and she was an excellent bridge player. She always cautioned me that it was important that one "review the bidding" before the play. Now that it's becoming apparent that the efforts to cap the well at Deepwater Horizon are going to be successful, we should pause and pay homage to Ms. Nippy's advice by reviewing the bidding. Any fair assessment would have to conclude that in spite of some people's criticism of the early response, (and by "some people" I mean Ms. Nippy's firstborn son James), one also must give credit to a much improved and vigorous response to the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf. So, let's review the bidding: First, the decision to keep the unflappable retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen in place as national incident commander, in spite of considerable opposition from some local politicians, has proven to be wise. Second, when Attorney General Eric Holder announced a criminal investigation into the BP disaster, it was a demonstration that the Obama administration meant business in dealing with this catastrophe. Third, the establishment of the $20 billion restitution fund administered by Ken Feinberg was the ultimate statement of the seriousness with which this situation was being addressed by the administration. Fourth, people who have deep knowledge of the events in the Gulf give substantial credit to Energy Secretary Steven Chu and other experts from government labs who were brought in to assist with the successful capping of the well. We in the Gulf region, in particular those of us in Louisiana, have a long way to go. We need our government to remain vigilant in addressing this. We need a lot of research into the science of the effects of the spill. And in the words of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, we need to continue to have the heel of our boot on the neck of BP. All of us in the region need to stay vigilant and aggressive in being sure that the inevitable "It's time to move on" mentality does not set in. Trust me. The last thing we need to do is move on until our precious coastline is both restored and renewed. I don't know many people -- and no Democrats -- who were as tough on the Obama administration as I was when the oil started gushing.	1
The comic Gallagher, known for smashing watermelons, is "slowly recovering" from a heart attack suffered just before he was to perform at a Texas club, his promotional manager said Thursday. "We will not know the outcome until sometime tomorrow," Christine Scherrer said. Gallagher, 65, is in stable condition at an undisclosed Dallas-area hospital, Scherrer said. He was about to go onstage Wednesday at Hat Tricks, a Lewisville, Texas, club, when he fell ill and was taken to a hospital by paramedics, she said. "His family is with him and Hat Tricks has been unbelievable with the help and support with everything," Scherrer said. His shows in Texas, Oklahoma and Oregon scheduled through next week have been postponed, she said. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.	1
Let me tell you 'bout Wayne and his deals of Cocaine A little more every day Holding for a friend till the band do well Then the D.E.A. locked him away -- The Clash, "Jail Guitar Doors" The first thing you notice about the  young, bald, clean-shaven, dark-eyed man with the dark, dark eyes  is that he's black, the second thing you notice is that he's  a dealer, the third thing you notice is that he's also very  good-looking.I once read somewhere that the first thing people notice  about drug dealers is that they're black. Black's the first  thing people notice about drug dealers, and it's not just  because of their appearance. A drug dealer's physical  characteristics are also significant. If you've ever been  hustled on a city street, you've probably had a run-in with  a black dealer. They're tall, thin, dark-skinned African  men. They tend to be short and stocky, with big,  black, chunky foreheads and small, black, chunky, flat  cheeks. If they're white, you can usually tell just by  looking at them. But their dark skin doesn't help.Why is this? Well, when the white people of this  country first encountered black drug dealers, they thought  that they were just looking for a good time. What they  didn't know was that these were gangbangers, the  younger ones with big, round, puffy, pug-nosed faces  who'd been raised by crack babies and weren't really  gangbangers at all. For them, the ghetto was just a  place where they could buy dope and pick up men.The first thing you notice about a drug dealer is that  he's black.A drug dealer isn't about drugs. He's about _money._  A drug dealer's about getting rich quick. A drug  dealer's about getting rich in the short time it takes  to sell a couple of hundred dollars worth of  drugs.	0
Guantanamo Bay's legacy of torture will hurt the United States even if President Obama makes good on a pledge to close the prison camp, a former inmate says. Moazzam Begg says that during intense interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, he would have confessed to anything. Justice will be impossible to mete out to the alleged terrorists and war criminals held there because any confessions must be tainted by the methods used to obtain them, ex-prisoner Moazzam Begg told CNN. Begg says he would have confessed to anything during interrogations while he was held at Guantanamo for nearly three years. "What procedure can you use on people who have been systematically tortured including waterboarding, including being stripped naked and beaten? What sort of evidence can be admitted into a court of law that has been extracted under that process?" asked Begg.  Watch what Begg thinks of Guantanamo » The new administration  has said that waterboarding, which causes the feeling of drowning, is torture. Begg, who is British, was captured during the war in Afghanistan and accused of aiding the Taliban regime.  His family has always maintained he was a victim of mistaken identity. He was sent back to his home in Britain by the Bush administration in 2005 and never prosecuted. President Obama on Wednesday moved closer to making good on his campaign promise. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the detention facility's closure, officials said. Earlier in the day, a judge granted Obama's request for a 120-day suspension of prosecutions so a review of all cases of suspected terrorists could take place. During his inaugural speech, he stressed that ideals of justice did not need to be thrown out to ensure the nation's safety. "Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake," Obama said.  Watch what could be next for Guantanamo » Legal issues are already complicating the cases of some of the most important terror suspects, like Mohamed al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker, who has been accused of helping to plan and possibly participate in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.	1
From his early days as one of the first faces familiar to television audiences in the 1950s, as host of "American Bandstand," Dick Clark was a constant. He wasn't just a major force in television, but in the music industry as well, up until his death on Wednesday at the age of 82. So it's no wonder that iReports flooded in from those who worked closely with Dick Clark, as well as those who only knew him as a friend who came into their living rooms, whether it be each week or only each New Year's "Rockin'" Eve. Dick Clark was involved with so much, from various award shows, to the popular "Pyramid" Game show, to "TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes," that only focusing on one reason he was so loved by so many just isn't enough. Even three reasons doesn't cover it. So here are ten reasons -- counting down, like he did to the new year -- why iReporters loved Dick Clark: 10. He was humble Sioux Falcone worked with Dick Clark in the 1980s. She well recalls him wearing a name tag to his own holiday party. "I was watching CNN and my son asked who the man on television was and I told him 'actually he was my boss.' And my son didn't believe me. So I pulled out this photo yesterday and here he was wearing a name tag. I thought it was really endearing." She also said that her fondest memory of Dick Clark was when he gave her his first desk after he moved to the west coast for 'American Bandstand.' She inquired about the piece of furniture with the office manager and a few days later Clark was at here desk. "He said, 'I heard you want my desk,' and I said I would pay, but he said I didn't have to pay for it," she said. "He helped me load his antique desk into my car," she said. "He would show random acts of kindness like that.'" 9. "He broke color barriers" Maxine Porter, the legal steward for the late Bill Pinkney of the R&B/soul group, the Drifters, put it this way: "What artist of color didn't have some association with Dick Clark over the years?"	1

The major tunnel between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was scheduled to reopen at 5 p.m. ET Thursday following a shutdown because of a iced-over river. The two-lane road, built in 1927 for the railroad, is closed to all traffic but emergency vehicles and those with official permission to use it because of the danger of flooding.Michigan State Police are in the area to provide escort.Heavy snowfall has disrupted plans to restore power in the region, as crews work to install downed line on a dam that was flooded earlier this week, said Tim Greiser, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources."We've had several reports of power outages that we're aware of within the Windsor area, but I'm not sure if that's indicative of what is going on in the state as a whole," Greiser said in an e-mail Wednesday night. "We'll be monitoring those downpours over the next couple of days."Detroit, which had planned to send out utility crews on Friday to restore power, said Wednesday night that the power situation in the region is "complicated."Crews began shutting off water service to residents, who were without power for two days, after the snow began falling Wednesday.When the weather permitted, crews installed new water mains to supply residents, who were without water for two days. Water service was restored at the same time crews were installing the new main.The National Weather Service has predicted more heavy rain over Eastern Michigan on Thursday morning.On Wednesday, the road was temporarily closed to all traffic for a water main break, but the closure was lifted Wednesday night."The traffic is expected to be cleared out by 5 p.m. tonight," said Brian Cole, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation.The state had planned to use plows and trucks to clear a 12-mile stretch in Monroe County from Ionia to Oakwood by noon Wednesday, and then by 4 p.m. Thursday to clear the roads up to the U.S. border in Houghton Township.But the snowfall that ended that plan, and the icy roads in the region, have prompted the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to declare a state of emergency and to send out workers to help residents."We will have workers out by 6 p.m. today to the hardest hit area and we	0
The world-famous Hubble Space Telescope is owned by the U.S. government and operated cooperatively by NASA and an institute under contract to NASA. Now that the government has shut down, the institute can still use existing resources to continue Hubble operations for as long as possible. Its staff has tried to ensure that -- to the extent possible -- the shutdown will not affect telescope operations. But events can overtake plans. If Hubble encounters a problem or a glitch, as happens occasionally, science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations. Safe mode means orienting the delicate instruments away from the sun while keeping the solar panels illuminated, to make sure no instrument loses power and is ruined. But in safe mode, the instruments won't record any of the light coming to the telescope. The approximate cost of one hour of Hubble observing is somewhere between $8,000 and $25,000, depending on whether one adds the costs of operating and refurbishing the facility to its initial construction costs. That means a two-week government shutdown could waste $3 million, $5 million, even $8 million of taxpayer investment. Frankly, the loss to science is far greater. Each year thousands of astronomers from around the world compete to decide where Hubble will point -- toward particular stars or planets or galaxies or gravitational lenses. Special science panels spend weeks setting priorities for the most important proposed science investigations. For every 10 hours of observing time astronomers want to use, only 1 hour is eventually approved. U.S. shutdown threatens launch of NASA's next mission to Mars That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations. The James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, is undergoing critical tests at the Goddard Space Flight Center. This has to be done at extremely cold temperatures, mimicking conditions in space, and the amount of time to cool the system down is one of the drivers of schedule and therefore cost. As long as the government remains shut down, the testing will have to wait. If the shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, the JWST instrument module will have to be warmed up, probably pushing the launch date forward by a few months and raising the cost commensurately (about $1 million per day).	1
A majority of cocaine imported into Australia over the past two years came from Mexico, the Australian Crime Commission told CNN in a statement Thursday. "This is in part due to the strong links ethnic South Americans and Mexicans have with cocaine producers in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru," the commission said. The intelligence came from a "comprehensive national picture of the overall illicit drug market," which involved data collected by a multitude of agencies, according to the statement. Although the statement stopped short of naming the specific organized crime connection between Australia and Mexico, they said, "opportunities brought by technology, by globalization ... and new information, brings with it opportunities for crime that were previously unimaginable." "We are also seeing more dispersed criminal networks," the statement said. "In addition, it may indicate more networking by criminal groups who are effectively subcontracting distribution rather than take the entire risk." Cocaine consumption in Australia is increasing, according to authorities, with a total of 359 importations detected between 2008 and 2009. "Recent increases in cocaine arrests and reported use, as well as considerable seizures of the drug in recent years indicate potential expansion of the Australia cocaine market," the statement said.	1
An unprecedented global crime wave threatens the most important natural places on Earth and we are failing in our efforts to stop it. Look past the drug wars, the counterfeiting industry and human trafficking and  you will see a real humanitarian crisis. The loss of vital habitats threatens the survival of every human being on the planet.How did the planet lose its natural world?Our forests, grasslands and seas have been replaced with huge areas of concrete. We cut down the forests for fuel, food and timber but we have also turned our back on a large part of our living planet. We are destroying the habitats of many species. We have also lost the capacity to manage and protect these lands in the face of the relentless assault of the human race.In this book, we have highlighted the most urgent threats to the natural world, and why we urgently need to act. Here is the book’s introduction which describes the problem and explains why we must act now.We all know about our oceans, rivers and forests. Without these, life on Planet Earth is unimaginable. But some of the most important places on Earth have been lost in recent decades and are now threatened by the same global crime wave that is destroying our entire planet.We are losing more than we realise:80% of the world’s forest cover is lostOver 50% of the world’s freshwater has been lostOur seas have shrunk by up to 40% in recent decadesWe live on a planet that contains more than twice as much carbon as when we humans began. We are creating more carbon dioxide than all other human activities combined, in fact, we are causing more carbon dioxide than our entire energy production has created.We are also destroying our own home and we are destroying our future on Earth. We are destroying our natural world.This book is a call for action from people of humanity. It is a call for us to act together, to stop our destruction of our planet and protect our remaining wildlife, plants and animals. We live in a world that is threatened by crime. We must join together to ensure that we not only survive but thrive.We need to work together to preserve vital habitats for wildlife, plants, bees and fish. These are the places that are vital for us. If we don’t act now, our future is at risk!“If you are	0
The company was founded in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the original brains behind one of the major players in early  microcomputing--Motorola. They wanted to create a company that could compete with the likes of IBM's  the most important company of that era, and they envisioned a computer as a sort of a personal computer, with a personality and an aesthetic as well as an operating system and hardware.Athletic designThe company name was derived from the first part of its name: "Motorola," meaning "Motorola," the Greek goddess of the arts and crafts, and the origin of the word "motor."The company's original goal was to create an affordable personal computer, more for educational use than for use in home business, but also to have a computer that was useful to the general public. It was to be a computer that would be easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing, a "personal computer with personality."The first version of the Motorola Computer was named the "Bob Smith," and it was designed by Bob Noyce as a model for the computer that would be used by Bob Smith himself as a teaching tool.Early computersMotorola's main competitor in the development of the first microcomputer was the Tandy Corporation, with its TRS-80 model 1, released in the U.S. in 1977. It was a much more advanced computer than the Smith, with support for programming in BASIC, and multitasking, as well as a built-in cassette tape, but it cost ten times more.The Apple Lisa came out in July 1976. Lisa was the first product of the personal computer industry to use a microprocessor, rather than a custom-built CPU (central processing unit).The Lisa was a computer based on a Motorola 68000 CPU, and was sold as a system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated circuit. In contrast, the Smith was based on a Tandy TRS-80 using a Motorola 68000 CPU.HardwareThe Smith was the first true microcomputer of the era, with a single-chip "intelligent" computer on which the programs were running. It had a BASIC interpreter with BASIC extensions, a ROM BIOS, hard drive, and a cassette tape player. It had a single-chip CPU, the Motorola 68000. The Smith had	0
The CIA is collecting bulk records on international money transfers, using the same Patriot Act legal authority that has become the center of controversy in U.S. surveillance programs, a source told CNN. A person familiar with the program said the agency's  collection of bulk data, which involves using the NSA's bulk collection programs to collect information on international money transfers, is legal and necessary. A senior NSA official says the collection of bulk data is consistent with a 2011 presidential order from President Obama, an order the NSA Director, General Keith Alexander, has defended as lawful. The source told CNN the information the agency is collecting is "indefinitely" and the agency may be collecting it for "years to come.""This is not a secret," the source said. "This is actually something the agency itself admitted, that it is not a secret. The Patriot Act allows it."The source, who requested anonymity, said the CIA collects bulk data on international money transfers, including using the NSA's bulk collection programs to collect information on transfers. The source said the bulk data is used to study how money moves around the world and how it moves among the different countries involved in trade. The CIA's collection of bulk data is based on the Patriot Act, which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in the 2012 case by the ACLU and four individuals challenging the bulk collection."This is not a covert program," the source said. "Not a secret program."A source close to the program said the information the CIA collects involves an "unprecedented" amount of bulk data, especially when compared with the information gathered by the NSA's bulk collection programs.The official said the NSA collects a far higher volume of data."I have not seen a more extensive program in my 32 years in government," said NSA Director General Keith Alexander in June. He said his agency's programs allow for the "most comprehensive monitoring of the globe."The CIA's bulk data collection program is based on the use of the Patriot Act, which the Supreme Court upheld in the 2012 case by the ACLU and four individuals challenging the bulk collection, the Justice Department said in a letter to the House judiciary committee in February.The CIA's bulk collection program, which has not been disclosed publicly, is based on an assertion that the CIA has an interest in knowing how international money transfers work, such as whether terrorists travel freely	0
An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York. As Abu Anas al Libi walked into court to face the charges, his hands were shackled, his hair was short, and he sported a red, bushy beard, graying around his face and chin. He moved slowly and appeared unsteady. He told the court he was 49, but he looked 10 to 15 years older. His family told CNN he suffers from hepatitis C. Judge Lewis Kaplan signed a medical order for care. Wearing gray sweatpants, a black, long-sleeved shirt and black flip-flops with beige socks, al Libi walked from the holding area into the stately wood-paneled courtroom. In response to a question from Kaplan, al Libi said he preferred to be addressed by his proper name, Nazih Abdul Hamed al Ruqai. Abu Anas al Libi is the name he was known by within al Qaeda. Al Libi means "from Libya." Who are the world's 10 most dangerous terrorists? Al Libi answered the few questions posed to him by Kaplan through a translator. "Yes," he said, he understood the charges against him; and "No, I can't," he said, when asked if he could afford a lawyer. He will be appointed a Criminal Justice Act attorney trained in handling federal terrorism cases. He is being held without bail, since Kaplan agreed with prosecutors that he poses a flight risk and is a danger the community. That lawyer, David Patton, issued a statement Tuesday stressing that "the presumption of innocence is not a small technicality here." Patton notes his client is mentioned in the 150-page indictment "in a mere three paragraphs relating to conduct in 1993 and 1994 and nothing since." In those paragraphs, authorities allege al Libi met with al Qaeda members about bombing the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, which ended up happening five years later in 1998. "There is no allegation that he had any connection to al Qaeda after 1994," Patton said, "and he is eager to move forward with the legal process in this case." U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers seized him on October 5 from outside his house in Tripoli, Libya.	1
Military police poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday in hopes of stopping clashes between protesters and police, as the Egyptian government said a truce had been declared through a group of clerics. The truce lasted about three hours. CNN saw  people on the square, including many women, children and elderly who had travelled there with their children to show support for the sit-in protesters. At one point, the head of the army, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, arrived in parliament to talk to MPs and called on protesters to go home.The protesters took to the streets in late October, calling for the ouster of Egypt's military rulers. They were the culmination of months of frustration over a series of corruption scandals -- including a case of army officers allegedly bribing some of the country's top judges -- that has seen millions of people out of work, rising food prices and higher gas and electricity bills. There were fears earlier in the year of a violent crackdown and the return to the streets of Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted by the military in 2011. The army says it is in control of the country.The protesters had demanded that the army step down and hold a fair election before the state was handed back to civilian rule. The army and its allies in parliament, which they have dominated since the revolution, refused to rule out the use of force. Protesters were angered by the resignation of Egypt's vice president, Omar Abdul Rahman, a liberal and an advocate for women's rights. The army denies pressuring Abdul Rahman to step aside for a Islamist ally, the Muslim Brotherhood, which it has blamed for the unrest. The protests were followed by a violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which has seen more than a dozen people killed. The Brotherhood says it has been targeted.The protesters say they want an end to the corruption that has caused them to out in the street. The demonstrators also want an end to the political and economic crisis in Egypt, where the economy is stuck in a slow-moving paroxysm, and the government has been forced to take unprecedented measures to secure fuel and medicine. The protests have put an end to the four-year period of the government's tight hold on power and the army's attempt to hold on to power.The Egyptian government has promised to implement a new constitution that would allow freedom of expression and assembly. The protests had brought the country to a standstill for three and half months.	0
The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year. And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday. The increase in ills that has plagued the shipping industry throughout 2012 continues to leave analysts and companies alike to bemoan the state of the global economy. In September, the United Nations estimated that losses tied to the attack and hijacking of commercial ships in the first three years of the twenty-first century totaled $28 billion. (See more about Somali piracy.)In a report released Wednesday, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said there were 1,876 incidents involving vessels with crew members and cargo in 2012. That compared to 993 in 2011. In addition, the IMB said 394 vessels were attacked, a significant increase from the 332 incidents in 2011."I think the number of incidents reported and actually happening is far higher than it should be if we’re taking all these incidents reported,” said IMB spokesman Robert Mickens. “I think there’s a lot of ships that are either never reported or people are afraid to report what’s going on, whether it’s in their community or not.”An International Maritime Bureau spokesman, Rob Mickens, said that the agency began keeping track of Somali piracy in 2009. The agency then began releasing information on the attacks in 2011, when Somali pirates were still active.IMB said its data shows more hijackings, more attacks and more attempts in 2012 than any year the agency has tracked in the past decade."The data shows the real-life impact of the on-going conflict in the region is still being felt," said Mickens. "I think the maritime community continues to be very alarmed when they feel that there’s not enough progress being made to bring the pirates back to any kind of justice.”The numbers released Wednesday come as pirates continue to hijack commercial vessels, with no end in sight.“The reality is there will be attacks and hijackings and incidents, so they have to be dealt with in some way,” said David Madden, a professor of naval defense studies at the Naval War College. “These are pirates and they are not going to change.”Pirates captured by Somali maritime authorities have often	0
As he strained, crunched and lifted weights, the muscle panels surfaced from Jason Dinant's stomach. Faintly at first, they emerged: one, two, three and four -- not yet a six-pack. "In the first  second, it was like one of those cartoons showing a child being born," he said. "I was in labor."As he was a newborn baby boy, Jason Dinant was not an Olympic contender in the weight room. As he is a U.S. Olympic hopeful in weightlifting, Dinant had only one goal: to finish his first workout.A week after he turned one, a medical group, including one member of the U.S. Olympic Committee, intervened. "We said, 'It's not that easy to get a kid to do something he shouldn't,' " Jason Dinant recalled. "I didn't want to let go."Jason Dinant's parents, Jon and Susan Dinant, have not spoken publicly. The family's official response to the issue is that they do not know who has been responsible for their son's "unusual progression," though they are angry and concerned a team doctor was involved in their son's training.A four-time national champion in the featherweight division, Jason Dinant was the youngest and first wrestler from Colorado to earn Olympic gold medals. He has been a successful weightlifter, winning three gold medals, including in the light-heavyweight division during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and another world championship gold in 2006.As he has grown older, Jason Dinant's physique has changed dramatically. Now he's stronger than he ever was and much more muscular, but he remains as shy and reserved with strangers off the mat as he is in public.Last week, Dinant, 31, was at a public weightlifting event in Englewood, Colo., and an audience member approached him."I don't care who you are," Dinant said he was told. "I don't have to do this with people like you."The weightlifting contest was scheduled to be a final for the 2013 U.S. Olympic Weightlifting Team. The winner will be selected as the U.S. flag bearer at the opening ceremony in August for the 2012 London Olympic Games. The winner also would be invited to the team's first training camp in October.In the week	0
An 11-year-old Pennsylvania boy is missing in Egypt, according to the boy's family. The family says that the boy's Egyptian father abducted him. A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Cairo, meanwhile, says U.S. authorities are "aware of the situation" and are assisting the boy's mother in her search efforts. Stephano Khalil Mohamed Atteya, or Nikko as he is called by his family, went to Egypt with his mother and her sister to visit his father, who lives there, according to a missing person report from the Pennsylvania State Police in Harrisburg. The boy was last seen August 1 with his father, the boy's family said. The father sped off with the boy in a car after forcing the boy's mother and aunt from the car, the family said. "They heard (Nikko) screaming from the window, calling for his mom," said Nikko's aunt, Olga Panagos, who lives in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania. "That's the last time they saw him." Nikko's father, an Egyptian citizen, requested that his son come to Egypt to meet his grandmother and attend his father's sister's wedding, American relatives said. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is working with Nikko's mother, who is still in Cairo, and with local authorities to help locate the boy, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Colton. The boy's parents were married in 1999 and divorced in 2005; Nikko was their only child together and was born in the United States, according to Panagos. "The family is very stressed. We have no idea where Nikko is," Panagos said. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, also is working with the family to provide any appropriate assistance, according to Casey spokeswoman April Melody. CNN's Leigh Remizowski, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.	1
The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee. Indonesian media reported that 15 people were killed, including some journalists who were Â­Â­attempting to cover the crisisÂ­.Sixty-one survivors in one village were sent to treatment center, according to the head of medical services in the province.It's not yet clear who is to be blamed for the disaster. But experts say the volcano is a hotbed for forest destruction and could provide fuel for devastating eruptions. (Photo: AP)The mountain's eruption has caused widespread destruction and the evacuations are expected to continue in coming hours. There is no known damage to the island of Borneo, the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan or neighboring Papua-New Guinea. But the mountain is a major source of the gas hydrates, a complex mixture of minerals and trapped methane that have been trapped at the bottom of the planet's oceans for many years. If the mountain erupts again, there could be more devastation of Borneo and Papua-New Guinea.Mount Merapi, the second largest volcano in Indonesia, has been erupting for two months.(Photo: AP)The Associated Press says at least 3.4 million people live within a few hundred kilometers of the volcano.Indonesia's national disaster agency, BNPB, has warned that the crisis "is not over. There are people who still do not know what they should do."The area in question is part of Kalimantan, where a government official says about 4,000 people were living in evacuation centers, including "a few thousand" journalists, local TV and radio reporters and photographers.According to the head of Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Jokowi, the eruption is an "extremely dangerous situation."According to the US Geological Survey, Merapi is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. It is a stratovolcano with a height of 19,988 feet (6,913 meters), located on the island of Java.Although volcanoes on the island mostly erupt for two or three days, Merapi shows signs of continued activity.The volcano was first studied by Europeans in 1877. It erupted in 1968 and in 1979 and 1980.It last erupted	0
With Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign officially over, she is focusing on making sure her supporters back Sen. Barack Obama's bid. Sen. Hillary Clinton suspended her presidential campaign on Saturday. Throughout the primary season, Clinton and Obama expressed confidence the Democrats would unify once a nominee emerged. As Clinton closed her campaign Saturday, she urged the cheering crowd of thousands to support Obama in his run for the White House, saying she and supporters should "take our energy, our passion and our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama ... I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me." Her endorsement was met with a scattering of boos and thumbs downs from the crowd at the National Building Museum in Washington.  Watch Clinton urge voters to back Obama » In a CNN poll released Friday, 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for Obama, but 17 percent said they would vote for McCain and 22 percent, said they would not vote at all if Clinton were not the nominee.  Watch how Clinton's speech might impact voters » The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 7.5 percentage points. The poll was conducted after Obama clinched the Democratic nomination Tuesday. Clinton has vowed to do whatever she could "to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain." Concern about the division in the party arose because Clinton and Obama appealed to such different segments of the electorate. Clinton did well with working-class voters and the elderly. Obama rallied the support of affluent, well-educated voters, African-Americans and the younger generation. Some of Clinton's top supporters say the best way to get the New York senator's 18 million voters behind Obama is by putting Clinton on the ticket. Democrats appear to like an Obama-Clinton ticket. A CNN poll released Friday suggested that nearly half of those voting Democrats, 54 percent, would support a joint ticket, but 43 percent would oppose it. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. "I've looked at every other possible candidate. No one brings to a ticket what Hillary brings," Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Sunday on ABC's "This Week." But not everyone is behind the idea of a joint ticket. Former President Jimmy Carter said that would be "the worst mistake that could be made."	1
Rock singer Sammy Hagar, a little older since his Van Halen days but still featuring bountiful blond curls, touted single moms, family and sex Monday night on the premiere of HLN's "Dr. Drew." But for Van Halen fans, Hagar's memories of the band and how he would like to regain a friendship with Eddie Van Halen may have been the biggest draw. "The greatest part of my musical career was being in Van Halen," said Hagar, who described to Dr. Drew Pinsky the alcoholism in his father and former bandmates. One of the band members, Hagar said, went into rehab and got clean, but "Eddie keeps falling down and would be in denial." Hagar, 63, claims Eddie Van Halen, who he says is doing better these days, is perhaps jealous of his success since leaving the band, a power hard rock mainstay of the 1980s and 1990s. "They threw me out of the band, and they haven't done anything since 18 years later," said Hagar, author of a bestseller "Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock." "He's got the biggest heart in the world," Hagar said of Eddie Van Halen. In other comments, Hagar: -- Recalled dreaming as a young man about an alien encounter, with blue beings and beams of light. "You can call me crazy all you want. Anyone who says we are the only life in this whole vast universe, they are crazy." -- Admitted to many sexual consorts during his days on the road and between marriages. Now, "I chase my wife around the house." -- Talked about being raised by a single mother in an abusive marriage. "My mother made me feel love." -- He also spoke about his father who he said died in the back of a police car."Because of my father I am very sensitive to it," Hagar said of alcoholism. -- Touted old-fashioned hard work. "I was willing to work my butt off for anything I could achieve," Hagar said. "I came from nothing." Pinsky, who has been a physician for 30 years, opened the show with an answer to critics who say he can't diagnose at a distance. "I have studied thousands of cases ... It's what I do."	1
Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. In a 7-2 ruling on January 22, 1973, the justices declared laws prohibiting abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to privacy. They also said states could  prevent the procedure by making it illegal.Since then, abortion has been illegal in most of the United States. Yet abortion remains legal in 40 other countries and territories, including Canada, which passed a landmark ruling on Thursday to protect the procedure in the most restrictive country in the Americas.Abortion is often used to end pregnancies that are 15 weeks or earlier and pose a threat to the health of a mother or fetus, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Still, the procedure can take place as early as seven days before the fetus becomes viable, which varies depending on health conditions.In fact, abortion usually occurs after a fetus has reached 20 weeks — roughly the time for it to take on a human appearance — but it can occur even earlier, according to the National Right to Life Committee.Some advocates for abortion say the 40 countries that allow the procedure also offer lower-risk options for women."I think it is safe to say that abortion is safer in places where it's legal," said Lisa Sclafani, chief counsel for the National Right to Life Committee.And even there, that's disputed, she said."In the U.S., we have very different views on the ethics and morality of abortion," she said in a phone interview. She said abortion should be allowed only in a limited circumstance, such as during a rape or incest case."If a woman is raped or has a medical emergency in the situation where she can't bear another child, she should be able to make that choice and she should be able to get the care she needs," she said.Sclafani said abortion is dangerous if it's needed to save the life of the mother. When the mother is on the verge of death or if the procedure's other complications are deadly, she said the procedure is "just plain bad.""I don't know how a woman can be forced into an abortion in a situation where the pregnancy has been terminated, and she's not in immediate danger," she said.The 40 countries allowing abortions include: Albania, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Argentina,	0
Nicaragua's election officials have officially declared President Daniel Ortega's victory, but opponents are protesting the results. A report from the Organization of American States indicated "irregularities in the elections," but supported official results saying that Ortega won re-election after garnering more than 62% of votes. "A process is legitimate if the people feel that there wishes were respected, and that is what we are experiencing here," said Roberto Rivas, president of Nicaragua's election authority. But protests and clashes throughout the country after the November 6 elections have left at least four people dead and dozens injured, police said. According to a report presented by the Organization of American States' election observers, irregularities during elections included problems providing identification card to vote, problems in the accreditation of observers and imbalances in political parties present at polling stations. For opponents of Ortega, the report shows evidence of fraud. "Obviously here transparency is missing. They didn't take a series of legal steps that they should have," said Eduardo Montealegre, a representative from the opposition Independent Liberal Party. The Organization of American States says its vote count echoes the official election results. But one local pro-democracy group says the problems the organization identified would equally impact their own tallies. "It's not that the results changed on the way (to be counted), it's that the absolute power of the councils overseeing the polls did not allow any challenges," said Roberto Bendana, president of We Make Democracy. Last week U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland weighed in over reports of procedural irregularities and voter intimidation. "Frankly, if the Nicaraguan government had nothing to hide, it should have allowed a broad complement of international monitors," she told reporters in Washington. Disputes over the results have caused confrontations between protesters and authorities, said Marcos Carmona, executive secretary of Nicaragua's Permanent Human Rights Commission. "We have reports from different citizens about aggression on the part of the National Police," he said, including the deaths of a father and two sons. Last week a National Police spokesman said the three had died during clashes with supporters of Ortega's Sandinista party, adding that protesters had provoked clashes with police.	1
Residents of communities north of St. Louis fled the onrush of river waters this week, after two levees breached, but Wednesday brings relief, as rivers continue to retreat, weather forecasters say. Although some thunderstorms are approaching from the west, they should not drop enough rain to refill the receding currents of the the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers at St. Louis, according to CNN's weather unit. Downstream on the Mississippi, at Cape Girardeau, water arriving from St. Louis is expected to push the river's level to 45 feet, according to the National Weather Service. At currently just over 43 feet, it stands 11 feet above flood stage there. Levee breaches A 100- to 150-foot section of levee gave way outside West Alton, Missouri, Tuesday near the point where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi, St. Charles County's emergency management office reported. Residents of an estimated 43 homes in the area were told to evacuate. The levee failed around noon (1 p.m. ET). By evening, authorities were scrambling to bolster about a three-quarter-mile section of levee near Portage des Sioux, about nine miles upstream from West Alton. The area is home to a nearly 1,000-megawatt coal-burning power plant, and officials were hauling truckloads of stone and heavy earth-moving equipment to the site in an attempt to prevent the levee from failing. On Monday emergency teams rushed to get hundreds of people to safety, after a levee breach on the Missouri River near West Alton. Many residents didn't need to be told twice to get out. "I want to be safe rather than sorry," Heather Wendle said. "I don't want to take the chances." From trickle to torrent After weeks of heavy rain in the upper Midwest, the Mississippi is still running above flood stage at St. Louis, in spite of dropping water levels, the Corps of Engineers reported. The flood waters stand in contrast to the near river drought a few months ago. The Mississippi had been running so low that the Corps feared it would have to close the waterway to barge traffic. In December, the Corps of Engineers had hundreds of tons of rock dug out of the river at Thebes, Illinois, about 125 miles downriver from St. Louis, to make sure barges could pass.	1
A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on a fact-finding mission into the monthslong conflict there between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military. Appearing on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Menendez called this a "watershed moment" in the conflict. He said it's time to recognize what's really happening in eastern Ukraine -- not a rebel uprising, but a Russian invasion. "And we must recognize it as that," said Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "When I read the headlines back at home that suggest rebels are advancing in different parts of eastern Ukraine, it's not rebels -- it's Russian soldiers." "We should be providing the Ukrainians with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon (Russian President Vladimir) Putin for further aggression." U.S. President Barack Obama has opposed supplying Ukraine with weapons in the past, but Menendez said he believes the Obama administration should re-examine what he calls changed circumstances there. "I think the European Union, NATO, as well as the United States has to consider this is dramatically different and we have to give the Ukrainians the fighting chance to defend themselves. I'm not suggesting U.S. troops here or NATO troops here ... but I am suggesting that the Ukrainians have the wherewithal to fight for themselves. " Poroshenko warns of looming war with Russia Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned Saturday that his nation's crisis with Russia has worsened in recent days and is inching closer to a "full-scale war." "I think we are very close to the point of no return," Poroshenko said following an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium. "The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened in the territory controlled by separatists and where -- instead of separatists -- there are regular Russian troops." Poroshenko said thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory. Russia has repeatedly denied supporting the rebels or sending troops over the border. But the West has rejected Moscow's denials. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at a meeting in Brussels, said new sanctions are in the works for Russia.	1
A man who once appeared discreetly as a stunt pilot in movies became the center of national attention after a crash at a Nevada air show. Jimmy Leeward is presumed dead after the Friday crash. The Â¡F*** That!Â¡ was a Boeing 757 flying low over the Las Vegas Strip. The plane's tail was seen to have been broken by the impact, and both wings were damaged, including the right wingtip that broke off. It crashed into a crowd at McCarran International Airport, where the landing gear collapsed, causing the plane to crash. One eyewitness described the crash, which also happened at the same time in Arizona, as a "one of a kind accident." Leeward, a commercial pilot for United Airlines, had been flying for just over a year, but had been on the company's flight test program for two years. His passenger, an unidentified woman, and three children aboard the plane were not injured.Jimmy Leeward, a commercial pilot for United Airlines, had been flying for just over a year, but had been on the company's flight test program for two years. His passenger, an unidentified woman, and three children aboard the plane were not injured after a passenger jet flew into a crowd of people watching an air show in Las Vegas.Jim Leeward, an experienced flight instructor, was supposed to have been the man responsible for this crash. But he wasnât. After this tragic accident, it is time to say the name of the aircraftÂ¡F*** ThatÂ¡! â The Boeing 757 that crashed into a crowd of spectators watching an air show in Las Vegas Friday is a Boeing 757, not a Boeing 767, as some reports said. Thatâs not the first time thatâs happened. The plane was called the Boeing 757, not the Boeing 767, after the model was redesignated by Boeing on Jan. 6, 1995. It was also redesignated as a 757 instead of an A300.We spoke with Jimmy Leeward a few days after the accident. As we previously reported, Leeward had just started working for United Airlines, but had been with the company for more than two years.

One Australian gold prospector has hit pay dirt. The man, described as an amateur explorer who wants to remain anonymous, unearthed a 5.5 kilogram golden nugget 60 centimeters in the ground Ã¢â‚¬â€ nearly twice the size of an average house brick.However, the discovery is not yet certified as a new world record, because Australia’s chief mineral inspector, Dr. Kevin Lees, has yet to approve the find. He is waiting for the official weight and confirmation that the finding is a valid world record.The find makes the prospector the first person to ever discover a nugget so large. It is estimated that 30 kilograms of nuggets exist and are being discovered all over the world.Now the lucky prospector must determine whether the find qualifies as a new world record. He faces more than just a legal challenge, because the find could also place his life under threat.How big is this one, anyway?How big is this one, anyway?Nugget mining is a world-wide phenomenon, and it’s especially common in Australia. In the past, Australia has made headlines by finding the “largest gold nugget”, and it now seems that gold nugget seekers are back on the radar, this time around a tiny one.The man who found the gold nugget is Greg Naylor and he claims that the discovery was made in 2009, in the Otway Ranges National Park in southeast Australia. Naylor, an expert nugget miner, says he has found a gold nugget in two separate locations, which makes the find a very rare one.Why does he need a nugget to prove he’s a true “gold nugget expert”?Nugget mining is a very risky business. A nugget is a chunk of rock which contains about 5 grams of pure gold. It’s about the size of a golf ball. There have only been a handful of successful nugget strikes worldwide, and some experts believe that only two will ever be found.Now Naylor has a nugget to back up his claim that he is indeed a true gold nugget expert, and he’s ready to get certified as the “world’s best nugget miner	0

Rodney King, whose beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 was caught on camera and sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved, was found dead in his swimming pool Sunday, authorities and his fiancee  said.King, 47, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital after police reported finding him unresponsive in the pool at the home of his fiancee, who was due to give birth to his child.The Los Angeles County coroner's office said the cause of death was drowning. Authorities on Monday didn't indicate whether they believe King died after jumping into the pool or whether the death was accidental.King was shot eight times with a revolver by four Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies Oct. 26, 1991, in the Pacific Palisades district of the city following a heated conversation with some of his fellow officers. Deputies responded to reports of a man loitering near a swimming pool after hours, according to police reports. King told the deputies that he was the man they were looking for, investigators said.The officers then entered King's home, grabbed him by the arms and threw him to the ground, with officers firing their guns after he fell. The officers, five of whom were convicted in the shooting of King in the landmark case, were acquitted by a judge on Feb. 2, 1993, one of only four such occasions when the Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped the case. The four officers were ordered to return for a new trial under a new law in California requiring prosecutors to explain their actions in a new trial to a judge.King was one of the black political leaders who participated in the Watts Riots in 1965 that sparked the Black Movement, which took on a life of its own and led to the election of Martin Luther King Jr. as the first black president of the United States.King also was a prominent member of the Black Panther Party, which was involved in the killings of Los Angeles police officers, and in one of the most intense clashes between police and protesters, the 1967 Watts Riots, in which hundreds of people were injured.He is survived by his wife, Cynthia, and their children, and by two other children. They also had a sister, Michelle King, who is also a former leader of the Black Panther Party.Born in Oakland and raised in Watts in California's South Bay area, King began his career as a singer and songwriter, though	0
On Sept. 12, 2009, frustrated tea party citizens from across the country marched upon the Capitol in Washington, energized by a shared sense of disenfranchisement in the political system and anger at a federal government they believed was taxing too much and racking up a dangerous amount of debt. Two years later, much has changed. A powerful coalition of tea-party-backed freshmen walks the halls of Congress, where they have unsettled the establishment and pushed their own party to the right. On the campaign trail, the support of tea party groups has helped launch campaigns and is a force candidates ignore at their peril. For those who doubt the movement has moved toward the mainstream, the Tea Party Express will join CNN on Monday night to host a nationally televised forum where eight GOP presidential candidates will vie for tea party support. The loose affiliation of activists is making the transition from upstart outsiders to a force trying to affect change from within, putting different pressures and expectancies on the movement. "We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country. "We're a get-out-the-vote machine. We're organizing at the community level." Expanding on its 2010 congressional election victories, the tea party has become a major factor in the presidential race this election cycle. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney acknowledged its reach in early September, when he rearranged his schedule last-minute to speak at two tea party events. Candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul have enjoyed strong early support from tea party groups and are working to leverage that momentum into victories in states such as South Carolina. Tea Party Express Co-Chairman Amy Kremer said as the movement continues to mature, tea partiers are increasingly recognizing their activism can change outcomes in Washington. The bloc has become so powerful, she said, that a Republican could not win his or her party's nomination without tea party support. "We're not going to sit back and just let the Republican party hand us the nominee," she said. "We're going to choose the nominee." Though tea party leaders maintain the movement will not become a political party and comprises activists of all political stripes, Kremer said most tea partiers expected better from their GOP elected officials.	1
Eight people were killed and 17 were injured Wednesday when an improvised explosive device detonated followed by a suicide bomber's explosion, according to police and medical officials. The attacks targeted people leaving al-Mustafa Shiite mosque after night-time prayers in al-Furat neighborhood in western Baghdad, according to the sources More than 16 suspects have been arrested by security police, sources told CNN. Al-Furat, a predominantly Shiite neighborhood, is just two miles from Baghdad International Airport. During a televised address earlier Wednesday Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki declared an amnesty for all Sunni tribesmen who fought against the government, with the exception of those involved in the killing of Iraqi forces. Al-Maliki also said he hoped that members of Iraq's parliament would be able to choose a president and prime minister in their next session. After much anticipation over how it would address the country's turmoil, Iraq's new parliament on Tuesday postponed its first session until next week, citing a lack of a quorum. The political uncertainty comes as Iraqi forces battle Sunni extremist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. "We are going to postpone because of an urgent matter," the speaker of the parliament said Tuesday. He did not say what the urgent matter was, and it was not immediately clear what happened. The newly elected parliament convened with 255 out of 328 elected officials attending, which was enough for a legal quorum, the speaker said. But when 90 failed to return after a morning break, there were not enough members to continue. Many had expected al-Maliki to call for the formation of a new government Tuesday, Al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government have been under pressure from Western and Arab diplomats to be more inclusive of members of Iraq's Sunni minority, who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process by the government. When ISIS fighters swept into northern Iraq, seizing the city of Mosul, reports emerged of some Sunnis either joining the militants or doing nothing to fight them. Under Iraq's constitution, the parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister. Lawmakers are under pressure to move faster, but the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past. The last time parliament met to pick a prime minister, it took nearly 10 months.

We must be on you but cannot see you." That was one of the very last voice signals transmitted by Amelia Earhart in the summer of 1937, somewhere over the vast Pacific Ocean during her ill-fated flight around the globe. An intense search led by the U.S. Navy was launched to find Earhart and her plane, but after several weeks, nothing was found. "All right, good night." Those were the last words transmitted 17 days ago from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, somewhere over the South China Sea between Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City. An international search led by the Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines and joined by governments and private companies from the United States, Great Britain, China, Australia, Norway, Japan, New Zealand and others have narrowed down a possible search region to a vast chunk of the Indian Ocean southwest of Perth, Australia. "This is probably the one of the largest efforts you'll ever see in terms of maritime surveillance and joint operations," Australian Defense Minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Reports now seem to support the theory, popularized by pilot instructor Chris Goodfellow, that an incapacitating emergency led the pilots to divert the Boeing 777 toward the closest airport (hence turning south) while simultaneously trying to fight an electrical fire of some sort until they were overcome. Experts believe that the jet continued on dumb autopilot until it was, like Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, plunging into the sea. Opinion: Flight 370's resting place is best clue Earhart was lost on July 2, 1937. MH370 disappeared March 8, 2014, more than two weeks ago. In those 77 years, almost everything about the world has changed. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared just a few years before World War II erupted and a new world order emerged: what is often called the American century. And the three-week search effort for Earhart was entirely American, directed by the Navy. Flight 370 was operated by Malaysia's national airline, en route to Beijing. The flight was the opposite of pioneering, instead a routine long haul of 227 passengers, with a coach class ticket costing about $530. But in this case, the search effort is extraordinary and much more international in scope.	1
The U.S. diplomatic cables obtained and released by WikiLeaks frequently rely on unnamed sources for delicate information. But one such source -- a businessman in Mozambique -- has furiously denied making remarks about high-level corruption attributed to him by a U.S. diplomat. A cable dated January 2010 sent by then Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman at the U.S. Embassy covered allegations about officials enabling drug trafficking by accepting bribes. They were based on a source who said he had "personally seen" one senior official [who is named in the cable] "receiving pay-offs quite openly." But now that source insists such words never left his mouth. "I feel I have been used. This is all Todd Chapman's own agenda. He obviously imagined I would never read what he had written," the source told the state-run Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (AIM). Several current and former officials came under attack in the cable in question. Chapman wrote that his source had told him the country's ruling party, FRELIMO, "brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks." The source also supposedly called the country's president a "vicious scorpion who will sting you," and said FRELIMO and an alleged drug lord had their own clearing agent at a port. In an interview with AIM, Chapman's source admits meeting him in 2009 but says he only told the diplomat of problems he was having with his business. When asked about other things, the source said, "I just told him I didn't know. I only knew what I read in the papers." A similar case surfaced in a leaked cable from Peru. In March 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Lima sent a dispatch insinuating that a regional Army commander, General Paul da Silva, was involved in drug trafficking. The source's name was redacted, but he suggested the general was coordinating drug shipments with another man who was later arrested for smuggling drugs hidden in consignments of frozen fish. Da Silva, now the head of Peru's military, strongly denied the allegation and has threatened to bring legal action against the ambassador who wrote the cable. The wife of Zimbabwe's president has sued a Zimbabwean newspaper for $15 million following its publication of allegations contained in a leaked cable that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern African country.	1
There's no question about it -- I hate to lose. On Tuesday, Alex Sink, a great Democrat running in a special congressional election in Florida, lost. When a campaign doesn't go my way, I always take a step back, look at the ides I've taken, and ask whether I made the right calls. In this situation, I would make the same call all the way back to the beginning.Let me be frank. The reason things didn't go my way on Tuesday was my decision to hire a pollster -- Ken Ciandella, the founder of Public Opinion Strategies -- who had no experience whatsoever of the congressional district I would be challenging. Ciandella, a Democrat, was hired out of the blue by my campaign. A month before the Democratic National Convention, I had made the decision to hire Ken for his superior talent and experience and I had the support of all the political heavyweights in my campaign. The last thing I wanted was a pollster who never has worked in politics. By taking on this pollster and paying him $18,000 for the first month's work, I thought I was being smart. Maybe I was. But this is the kind of mistake a professional political campaign should avoid.The problem, as I saw it, was that I didn't have a very good pollster. The problem seemed to be overconfidence on my part about what pollsters would say about my opponent, Karen Handel, and then overconfidence about the polls we were doing. And the reason the polls weren't very good was that, thanks to a decision made over the course of the previous 20 months or so, I had built a national team of about half a dozen pollsters, who worked under me and were responsible for the vast majority of our polling. But they didn't know the district well enough. This was my mistake. I should have gone back to the beginning, hired someone more experienced, and made sure they did well. I should have done that for my campaign going into the convention in July, when the national polls had only one person working for me.What I did was an unprofessional move that I knew I was making when I made it. But I did it anyway. I made a mistake for which I could have paid a high price. And the reason I paid so high a price is that, if I had known the cost of my error, and how much it would cost to correct	0
This past week, at "town hall" meetings in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and New Hampshire, a group of Republican senators sounded alarms about disasters that will befall local economies should the threat of more than $500 billion in defense cuts over the next decade become a reality in January. To his credit, the group's leader, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, admitted that Congress should take some of the blame for creating this situation. But that was a rare recognition of reality at town halls that were more like a Republican version of the mythical Potemkin villages: fake towns hastily put together by Russian Minister Grigory Potemkin to impress the visiting empress. The real purpose of the GOP's Potemkin town halls? To redefine Congress' unfinished task of deficit reduction as an Obama administration leadership failure that has put both national security and swing-state jobs at risk by playing games with defense spending. The road to these town halls began in Washington a year ago with a congressional vote that was needed to raise the debt ceiling and avoid U.S. default on a debt that has skyrocketed since 2000. House Republicans, shackled by a tea party ball-and-chain, turned the vote into a heated debate on spending cuts. The ensuing legislative battle led not to meaningful deficit reduction but to the Budget Control Act of 2011. It's an 11th-hour "Hail Mary" legislation that raised the debt ceiling -- and kicked the deficit can down the road by one year. The Budget Control Act mandated $917 billion in federal spending cuts over a 10-year period, including some $487 billion in defense cuts. But that wasn't all. The centerpiece was a different kind of act: A high-wire act called "sequestration." Sequestration is a trigger. It's scheduled to be pulled in early January -- unleashing $1.2 trillion in additional cuts, half in defense, half in other domestic spending, unless Congress agrees on an alternate plan. Almost no Democrat or Republican wants to make these sequestration cuts because they will have significant and negative consequences for national security and for domestic spending, affecting millions of Americans. In fact, almost no one who voted for this legislation ever thought these cuts would actually be made.	1
Two years ago, Egyptians toppled a longtime dictator and reveled in the hope of a new future. But frustration over the new leadership and controversial court verdicts have ignited clashes regularly. Here's what's behind the most recent unrest,  and what's at stake for the future of the nation.This April 26, 2011, file photo shows the Egyptian pyramids at Giza. Egyptians hope the recent presidential elections will usher in a new era. But the verdicts delivered by a state judiciary last week have ignited fears of repression. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File) (The Associated Press)In Egypt's politics, a verdict is a verdict, and every single one of them has been so far. The new president is only the latest in a very long line.What is a verdict? According to the Egyptian government, a verdict is a set of findings and conclusions made by the judicial system. Each of these verdicts will likely have a number attached to it that is meant to indicate to Egyptians the seriousness with which the new leader is being held to account.But what is more telling is that each case has been so far and each case may actually have been a "judgement" in the sense of someone's verdict over the next ruling, meaning that the final outcome of each case is still unknown. But the one certainty is that the government's claim that each case is "legal" has not been tested by any other authorities until now, meaning that each case is being treated by the government as legal until proven otherwise.What is less certain is that a trial verdict is legally binding and can be the basis of a new government's law.The verdict delivered by the state prosecutor on Friday is the latest in a series of controversial rulings that have rocked Egypt since late April. The judges said that the army chief has used his power to seize land under the pretext of "security," that he had interfered in the judiciary's powers to appoint cabinet members, and that he had used his position to prevent judges from carrying out their duties.There have been similar judicial verdicts before which have sparked further unrest. But in this case, there have been three verdicts that seemed to give the public pause, setting off a massive backlash.The first verdict came in March when the Supreme Administrative Court said that the president is above the law and that he should step down. A month later, the Supreme Constitutional	0

Tree houses -- from the luxurious and modern to the basic and cubbyhole-like -- sum up one of the best things about a vacation: getting away from it all. As for room service ... start hoisting. 1. Treehotel, near Luleå, Harads, Sweden Each of the five "tree rooms" making up this hotel deep in Sweden's arboreal forest, just south of the Arctic Circle, is designed by a different Swedish architect, and each is suspended up to six meters from the ground. The Bird's Nest is camouflaged with sticks and accessed by a retractable ladder; the Mirrorcube has reflective surfaces that blend into the landscape. The Cabin is a capsule-like room with a viewing terrace; the Blue Cone resembles a giant red Lego block. The UFO, built over two floors, looks a bit like a spaceship. Each stylishly furnished room sleeps two to four people and -- this is Sweden, after all -- has access to the site's Treesauna. Treehotel, +46 928 104 03; from $690 a night 2. Walnut Tree Farm, Aljezur, Portugal This back-to-basics wooden tree house perched atop a 100-year-old walnut tree overlooking a mountain stream is a short drive from some of the Algarve's best beaches. It sleeps two people, with a huge bed taking up almost the entire space. Down below is a kitchen unit, lounging space, compost toilet and solar shower, plus room to pitch a tent if you want to bring friends along. Walnut Tree Farm, +351 2829 91904; from $540 a week 3.

I remember fragments of the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau's killing in 2010 -- something about a ponytail, something about her slipping and falling, something about how this almost never ever happens because in these parks, the animals are happy and the trainers are safe. But something wasn't right. I remember asking someone why an orca -- a highly intelligent animal -- would attack its trainer or essentially "bite the hand that feeds it." We sometimes hear of dogs mauling other people, but in these cases we don't seem to hear about them attacking their masters. So why would America's lovable Shamu turn against us? How could our entire collective childhood memories of this delightful water park be so morbidly wrong? I came in with these questions. I set out to understand this incident, not as an animal activist -- because I'm not one -- but as a mother who had just taken her kids to SeaWorld, and of course as a documentary filmmaker who unfortunately can't let sleeping dogs lie. SeaWorld answers questions about 'Blackfish' I brought Manny Oteyza aboard as the film's producer, and he soon became my right arm. I spoke to Tim Zimmermann who wrote a phenomenal article for Outside magazine about killer whales and asked him to come aboard as an associate producer. I wrote a treatment. We were then funded by investors who had never made a film before. Together we set out to tell this story of an incident at SeaWorld. I knew immediately that I wanted SeaWorld to have a voice in the film. We e-mailed back and forth for about six months. I gave them every chance to talk, but they eventually declined. At that point, however, I had already began peeling back the onion. And my journey of shock and discovery was well underway. I have made television documentaries for 15 years, but "Blackfish" is my second feature documentary and my first one to have found theatrical distribution. I can't say this was an easy film to make. There were nightmares, too many autopsy reports, sobbing interviewees and unhappy animals.	1
Dozens of armed men seized the regional government administration buildings in Ukraine's southern Crimean region Thursday and raised the Russian flag in a challenge to the Eastern European country's new leaders. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with an ethnic Russian  majority, became part of Russia last week following a referendum that many in Crimea denounced as illegal. Ukraine's embattled government claimed the vote was invalid.Ukraine's interim president promised to continue to defend Crimea until the "terrorists" involved in the takeover are "neutralized completely." Russian lawmakers in the Crimean region have threatened to pull their flags from the Ukrainian flag when Ukrainian troops were deployed to counter the attack, according to a spokesman for Russia's parliamentary defence committee.The seizure of the regional government in Crimea comes at the same time as a Russian military move in Crimea could send the region into new bloodshed as fighting continues in the eastern Ukraine. There, Russian-backed rebels have seized key government buildings in the Donetsk region, a Ukrainian stronghold, where the Russian-backed government of President Viktor Yanukovych is also based.Ukraine's interim government accuses Russia of having sent troops into Crimea to seize two airports, one military base and to attack key buildings in the Black Sea peninsula. Ukraine's army is already on high alert, as it stands to protect the country's eastern frontier if a military conflict erupts in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine's parliament approved the country's bill on Wednesday to send troops into eastern Ukraine this week if it is necessary to free the country's government from the grips of eastern Ukraine's unrest, but President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Moscow doesn't see the unrest spreading to Crimea."Our military doesn't see any reason to launch a military operation in Crimea," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on state television.In response to the Russian-led move on Crimea, the head of the World Bank on Thursday said he feared a "fiscal nightmare" would emerge if Ukraine was left without a functioning government until next year."Russia's action is unlikely to be an isolated event, as its activities in Ukraine make it an even more unpredictable opponent of stable and democratic governance," the bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, told reporters in Washington.The bank's latest annual survey on global trends in inequality showed that Russia in 2014 ranked 133 out of 142 countries on the basis of an index measuring inequality of income among the world's richest 1% of society. The United States was ranked at 38, while	0
The Taliban have launched their spring offensive, their annual spate of attacks targeting foreign bases, government officials and Afghan  people since the death of the Taliban's founder Mullah Omar in a U.S. drone strike in late November.The attacks have killed at least 10 security personnel and wounded at least 12 more. In the latest incident, Saturday's suicide bombing near the Afghan army's main military headquarters killed two more soldiers.The Taliban on Friday claimed responsibility for two attacks in the past week that targeted American bases. In the first incident, an Afghan soldier and interpreter at a base in Paktika province in Nangarhar province were killed by a roadside bomb. The same week, a Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at an American base in Ghazni province, which took the lives of two American soldiers.While the Taliban maintains that the attacks are in retaliation for the death of Abu Ghazwan, the leader of al Qaeda's Afghan wing, the U.S. intelligence community says the militant group was planning to conduct the operations to avenge the deaths of their leader and top bomb-maker, Umar as-Atta, both killed in 2011 by a U.S. drone strike in the Pakistani garrison city of Jalalabad.Last month as-Atta died in the drone attacks, which the U.S. insists was carried out by a member of al Qaeda's local affiliate, the Haqqani network. Two days after the strike, the network issued a statement calling on its followers to strike at targets in Afghanistan to avenge the martyrdom of their leader.The U.N. panel of experts on terrorism and counter-terrorism has estimated the number of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan at 7,500, including about 3,000 foreign fighters, while the U.N. said 10,000 to 15,000 Taliban fighters were in the country.The Afghan government has said the number was more than double that number. The government has long sought support from the U.S. in the fight against the Taliban, but U.S. officials have warned that the presence of about 8,000 U.S. troops there and the ongoing presence of around 17,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan would only "make things worse" of an already-difficult fight.The Taliban, in turn, has frequently accused the U.S. of supporting the Afghan government	0
The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a betting scandal have been summoned to meet their country's top cricket authorities in London, England, where the alleged fixing took place, team manager Yawar Saeed told CNN on Tuesday.               On Saturday, the Pakistan Cricket Board summoned the three suspected match-fixing players back to Pakistan for questioning.    According to Saeed, the players, Anwar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez and Shahid Afridi, received the letter summoning them on Saturday and they were on their way to Birmingham Airport on Monday, where the team manager was to meet with his bosses, the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Pakistan Umpires Association.    In Birmingham, the three players were to be interrogated by the Pakistan Cricket Board -- the national governing body for cricket in Pakistan -- and the Pakistan Umpires Association, Saeed said.   Saeed said they were also to be questioned by the BCCI, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which rules cricket in the country, and the Pakistan Cricket Board's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.       The three suspected match-fixing players will be sent back to Pakistan on Tuesday, Saeed said, and the team will tour England on Thursday.   Saeed said the team manager had already discussed the match-fixing allegations with senior officials in the Pakistan Cricket Board's Anti-Corruption Unit and with officials in England.   Saeed, who is also the senior coach for the Pakistan international side, was asked to come forward with information about the alleged fixer, he told CNN.       He said he refused to hand over details about the alleged fixer to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, the domestic board for Pakistan's domestic cricket competition, but Saeed said the captain of the team, and other board officials, are aware of the allegations.   The allegations are being investigated by the Pakistan Cricket Board, which has been on a global blitz against players suspected of corrupt practices, Saeed said.   "The players are the ones who have committed the crime and therefore they are the ones who are being questioned in the [cricket] world,'' Saeed told CNN.	0
We've finally emerged from the season in which Americans were asked by the pollsters and politicians: "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?" But sometimes it's important to contemplate the question of progress from a longer view: How are we doing on the scale of a generation? To answer that question, take this brief quiz. Over the past two decades, what have the U.S. trends been for the following important measures of social health: high school dropout rates, college enrollment, juvenile crime, drunken driving, traffic deaths, infant mortality, life expectancy, per capita gasoline consumption, workplace injuries, air pollution, divorce, male-female wage equality, charitable giving, voter turnout, per capita GDP and teen pregnancy? The answer for all of them is the same: The trend is positive. Almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20% over the past two decades. And that's not counting the myriad small wonders of modern medicine that have improved our quality of life as well as our longevity: the anti-depressants and insulin pumps and quadruple bypasses. Americans enjoy longer, healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago. But other than the crime trends, these facts are rarely reported or shared via word-of-mouth channels. Idea of American exceptionalism a powerful force through history Many Americans, for instance, are convinced that "half of all marriages end in divorce," though that hasn't been the case since the early 1980s, when divorce rates peaked at just over 50%. Since then, they have declined by almost a third. This is not merely a story of success in advanced industrial countries. The quality-of-life and civic health trends in the developing world are even more dramatic. Even though the world's population has doubled over the past 50 years, the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50% over that period. Infant mortality and life expectancy have improved by more than 40% in Latin America since the early 1990s. No country in history has improved its average standard of living faster than China has over the past two decades. Of course, not all the arrows point in a positive direction, particularly after the past few years. The number of Americans living in poverty has increased over the past decade, after a long period of decline. Wealth inequality has returned to levels last seen in the roaring '20s.	1
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is considered a rising GOP star and the Republican Party's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues. The chairman of the House Budget Committee was first elected to Congress at age 28, and later became the youngest person to lead the Republican caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. His tenure as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, first as speaker from 1995 to 1999,This movie is about a small town called Woodstock, Connecticutthat was built on land where a gold mine once was, and it also was meant to be a place where the young people from the city of Woodstock could come to play football. It had good things about it, as well as a bad thing. There was a small town, but there were also the problems that come from being small. The town had all of these problems. They were the problems of small towns, and there was not much people could do about it.The town did not have a football team, which was a big part of the problem. Now, most towns that have a football team have something called a high school, which is a school for kids under 14. Those kids are usually called jocks. They're bigger, and they don't think too much about the issues that are going on in the town. They don't think about going to school or even getting a job to support themselves. The town also had another problem that was not easy to solve. They didn't have any water. Every house that was built, every business that was built, in Woodstock, needed a water tank. It was very common to have a family where you had only one bathroom. This is a problem in a town where people get very, very angry about having to take time out of their day just to take a bath. The town had the problem of not having a school or enough students, which would have been a major problem. They couldn't even afford their water tanks. Woodstock was the worst small town in America, according to a Gallup Survey. The town was the worst in America if you like that sort of thing.== See also ==Hometown, a 2004 American comedy filmExternal links  New York Times article on the movie   Category:2003 filmsCategory:2000s comedy-drama filmsCategory:2000s comedy-drama films	0
More than half of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd has died since last fall, forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program. Between harsh weather, hunting and an annual cull, fully half of Yellowstone National Park's bison have died. More than 700 of the iconic animals starved or otherwise died on the mountainsides during an unusually harsh winter, and more than 1,600 were shot by hunters or sent to slaughterhouses in a disease-control effort, according to National Park Service figures. As a result, the park estimates its bison herd has dropped from 4,700 in November to about 2,300 today, prompting the government to halt the culling program early. "There has never been a slaughter like this of the bison since the 1800s in this country, and it's disgusting," said Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a group seeking to stop the slaughter program for good. Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park. Brucellosis can cause miscarriages, infertility and reduced milk production in domestic cattle.  Watch Yellowstone bison search for pasture » The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that half of Yellowstone's bison herd is infected with the bacterium. Previously, under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis. (The meat -- which experts say is safe to eat if cooked -- and hides were distributed to Native American groups.) Late this winter the slaughter was limited to animals that tested positive for the disease. Now the program has been further curtailed; no bison have been killed in the past week. "The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle. We're required to keep bison and cattle separate," National Park Service spokesman Al Nash said. The USDA acknowledges that bison-to-cattle transmission is difficult to document, but it says investigations indicate that bison were the likely source of infections in cattle herds in Wyoming and North Dakota. But critics call the culling an overreaction. There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said. "I mean, it's hype, it's a hysteria," Mease said. "And it's not a fatal disease."	1
A journalist who has criticized NBC's coverage of the London Olympics has been suspended from Twitter after using the site to publish a network executive's private e-mail address and urge followers to message him. Guy Adams, the Los  Angeles bureau chief of the New York Times, confirmed Friday that the suspension was his first such action, and that he expects it to be the last.The suspension was the second time that Twitter has imposed a punishment on one or more users for tweeting about a story the site's algorithms determine to be sensitive, according to an internal memorandum from the Twitter team that was reviewed by The New York Times.In both decisions, the company imposed the fines after determining that the tweets violated the site's rules against “inappropriate conduct.” In the first case, the account was suspended for two days. In the second, it was suspended for 30 days.Adams' suspension followed an appeal by the NBCUniversal News executive, who told the Times that the network's CEO and top executives had made clear to him that they wanted to hear from Adams about his comments.In a tweet Friday, Mr. Adams suggested that the NBC executives had made their request in "a general way," without mentioning specific employees.“All it takes is one person in power to do something inappropriate and then the rules change the same way,” he tweeted. Mr. Adams said his tweets had “nothing to do with what you are doing at NBC Universal,” but Twitter disagreed.In the internal memo, obtained by The Times, the Twitter team concluded that Mr. Adams’ account violated a series of Twitter’s rules, including those against using private e-mail addresses or personal information in a way that might expose others to embarrassment or other harm.The memo described a range of e-mails received from Mr. Adams, all of which he had posted on his Twitter account. “We identified this behavior as violating the Twitter Rules,” the memo said, and that account was suspended.For two days, Adams had been tweeting at a level and frequency that violates the Twitter rules against posting “sensitive or potentially sensitive information,” the memo said. “We have determined that his actions violated our Rules against inappropriate conduct.” The suspension occurred “less than a week after he started posting on the account,” the memo said.Mr.	0
A Salvadoran national recently added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list for allegedly committing a 2011 murder in Colorado is under arrest, the FBI announced Wednesday. Edwin Ernesto Rivera Gracias was in El Salvador and after voluntarily agreeing to return to the United States to face charges he was flown to Denver on Wednesday, according to the FBI. He surrendered to Salvadoran authorities and FBI agents on Tuesday, said FBI spokesman Dave Joly. Rivera Gracias is accused of killing Richard Limon, 69, in August 2011. Law enforcement officials alleged that Rivera Gracias choked, beat and stabbed the man and then dumped his body in the mountains outside of Denver. According to the FBI, Limon was a long-tme family acquaintance of Rivera Gracias' teenage girlfriend. Rivera Gracias was in the United States allegedly illegally at the time of the Limon murder. The FBI described the suspect as between the age of 29 and 33 and said he was a member of the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang. He is said to have a number of tattoos including one of "MS-13" across his back. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles 20 years ago among Salvadoran immigrants fleeing the country's civil war. The government says it has now grown to about 10,000 members in the United States. In October, the Obama administration named the organization a transnational criminal enterprise, with the goal of freezing millions of dollars in profits from drug and sex trafficking operations. Rivera Gracias was added to the FBI's Top 10 list on March 14 and at that time law enforcement officials said they believed he had fled to his native country. The FBI announced a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his arrest. It's unclear if anyone will be receiving that reward money for tips provided in the case. In Wednesday's announcement the FBI said "further reward information will not be made public." The FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list was launched in 1950. The program seeks to publicize terrible crimes and get tips that lead to arrests. Rivera Gracias was the 498th person to make the roster. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was on the list until he was killed in Pakistan during a May 2011 raid by U.S. forces. Alleged Boston mob figure James "Whitey" Bulger spent more than a decade on the list and ultimately was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California.	1
Archaeologists have found more than 600 relics from a huge battle between a Roman army and Barbarians in the third century, long after historians believed Rome had given up control of northern Germany. Some of the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines. "We have to write our history books new, because what we thought was that the activities of the Romans ended at nine or 10 (years) after Christ," said Lutz Stratmann, science minister for the German state of Lower Saxony. "Now we know that it must be 200 or 250 after that." For weeks, archeologist Petra Loenne and her team have been searching this area with metal detectors, pulling hundreds of ancient Roman weapons out of the ground. They paint a picture of a highly organized, technologically superior Roman army beset by Germanic tribes in a forest about 80 km (50 miles) south of the modern city of Hanover. The hillside battlefield was discovered by relic-hunters illegally searching for souvenirs of more recent wars near the town of Kalefeld-Oldenrode. One of them brought some of the items he found to Loenne, who works for the local government. The artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines.  Watch how the battlefield discovery could re-write history » "We believe the Germans ambushed the Romans here, but the legions quickly fired back with catapults and archers -- and then it came to a massive man-on-man onslaught," Loenne said. The items unearthed so far include an axe, still sharp after nearly 1,800 years; horseshoes; shovels; spearheads; and dozens of arrowheads for a Scorpio, a cross between a catapult and a crossbow -- the ancient equivalent of artillery. "With a very high speed, on a very long distance -- about 300 meters -- you can hit targets precisely," said Henning Hassman, of Hanover's archeological institute. Researchers say the evidence suggests the tribesmen lured the Romans into the forest to keep them from making full use of those long-range weapons and draw them into hand-to-hand combat, outside of the formations the imperial troops had mastered. However, they believe the Romans ultimately prevailed.	1
The story of his selfless act went viral, but for Raymond Burse it was simply second nature. "I'm not extraordinary," said Burse. "I've assumed that people do those kinds of things all the time." In summer 2014,  Burse had been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder called myotonic Dystrophy, a disorder of his muscle tissue that made him completely unable to walk or stand. The first of many steps toward a cure, Burse got approval from the federal government to give people with his condition an alternative to wheelchair-bound mobility. He started a business making custom-made wheelchairs out of wood, then ordered tens of thousands of them on line. In time, he would assemble millions of the contraptions that eventually made up the world's largest wheelchair collection.His selflessness struck a chord with others as well. "Raymond said, 'This is not a problem for me personally, but I know people who have this issue ... What am I going to do?'" said Dr. Alan T. Oveson, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Virginia. "He has brought this disease to the attention of a larger and bigger audience than it ever had before."It was an act of selflessness that would play out during the last half-hour of his life.Raymond Burse was born in the Bronx on March 24, 1944. He died on December 16, 2018.His son, Peter, described his father as "a deeply caring, loving family man. He was a hard worker. He would push himself and push for the people around him. I believe he was a strong man."Tributes poured in on social media. The Rev. Christopher Ewell, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Woodbridge, Virginia, called Burse "a true gentleman." The Rev. Mark Williams of St. Simon and Jude Episcopal Church in St. Louis, Missouri, said Burse "was always there for the people."  "Mr. Burse was a man of God, a man of integrity, one of few to be kind to a stranger, not just anyone but anyone, and one of the rarest of them all," Williams wrote. He went on to say he was the kind of person who always thought of others, who had the ability to always see beyond themselves to help the less fortunate."A man of	0
The director of Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday defended giving away an estimated $85 million in hurricane relief supplies, blaming Louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles. A New Orleans charity keeps goods in urns for distribution each year.Some of the boxes with supplies were found on top of a pile of garbage bags thrown from a storage bin on Tuesday, the Times-Picayunereported, but FEMA officials said those were not donated items. Officials said the donated items mostly came from FEMA’s Hurricane Supply Program, administered by the agency.“We don’t like to tell people what we are going to do with the stuff,” FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said in an interview Saturday. “The way we treat our food is we put it in a pantry. We don’t bother telling you what to do with it. Nobody is going to see that stuff.”But for more than a year local, state and federal officials turned away the emergency items from FEMA, the Times-Picayune reported, citing the state attorney general office.In late June, the newspaper reported, “the nonprofit group FEMA Distribution Services, which distributes to food banks across the country, received over 1,700 tons of supplies through its charity partners.” FEMA received more than $85 million worth of supplies that arrived in late June.The donations included over 600,000 pounds of rice, 4,000 gallons of milk and 5,000 gallons of peanut butter.“The only concern we have is that the local government didn’t want to get involved with it, because they were in control of the situation in the state and didn’t want to have the federal government involved,” Fugate said, according to the Times-Picayune.In the face of continued criticism from critics including former state Rep. Brian Foster, a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, FEMA officials said they are still trying to figure out why they were told there were no donations in late June.Fugate defended his agency’s response to the hurricane and its work.“I think we were very diligent, and the reason was a lack of information and a lack of direction back to the local agencies,” he said.“But I don’t think we put ourselves in this position.	0
Britain's Prince Charles has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths. In a video message recorded to accompany the release of  The Prince's Progress report, the Prince said he was "troubled" by the reports about growing intolerance in the world today. "I want to say to governments that I am your servant and I ask them please to do more to prevent intolerance", he said in the video message. "The British government is doing just that, and I think that is an amazing achievement. I hope other countries can learn from that, but I am a little troubled by the reports of growing intolerance in the world today. I think the most important reason why in the world, governments must address this is because governments are there not to make our life better, but to make the lives of our neighbours better." The Prince's Progress report, published last week, is based on a review of government policies and how they have contributed to religious freedom.

Four of the suspects will appear before a magistrates court on Thursday, two others will appear on Friday morning and six on Friday afternoon. The arrests took place in three separate raids in London on Monday night following the arrests of nine men in two raids in Birmingham on Sunday, police said. The suspects had been detained in relation to terrorism. Mr Ahmed Ressam, described in court as a British convert to Islam, is the first of the suspects to appear before a judge. A sixth suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday. The court was told that Mr Ahmed Ressam was living in a flat in the city's Shoreditch neighbourhood, in the borough of Hackney. The 18-year-old was arrested with two other men, a 25-year-old man, another man, a 19-year-old and a 51-year-old woman. The other two people were arrested when they arrived at a north London hotel in a taxi. The other three were arrested in Birmingham. A spokesman for the Met said the arrests were	0
The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said. ÂThere is some uncertainty about the future of Lee because of its interaction with an upper-level trough,â said forecaster Jim Buzbee of the National Hurricane Center. ÂThere is uncertainty out at sea, but I donât think we have any impact on the eastern half of the U.S. at this time.âTropical Storm Lee brought the heaviest rain, wind, and surf on Wednesday for more than a month as a potent hurricane force storm system barreled toward the mid-Atlantic.It was a short-lived storm, however, with no hurricane-force winds on the evening of Wednesday. It weakened into a tropical depression, and is headed toward the mid-Atlantic on Friday.Forecasters cautioned that the storm would be a wild ride, with several feet of high surf and dangerous rip currents for some areas along the Atlantic Coast.The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee are currently to the east of Bermuda, with the storm shifting over the warm waters Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.The storm weakened to a tropical depression as it was moving west of Bermuda early Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.By noon, the depression had lost the warm waters and was moving quickly over warm water.

Jeremiah Pauley remembers all too vividly the moment that shrapnel from a roadside bomb in Iraq tore into his body and left his right arm dangling uselessly. Despite being seriously wounded, the Staff Sergeant was still yelling orders to alert others to the danger, but it was already too late and one of his men had died. The shock kicked in. "There was not a lot of pain, I was drifting in and out of consciousness and someone was tapping me on the forehead to tell me to keep awake," he tells CNN. Pauley had been leading an 18-strong patrol of the United States First Armored Division in the city of Tal Afar when he was hit by the blast. "I was taken to a field hospital in Mosul -- laying there in my hospital bed with this contraption on my arm," he recalls. Pauley was presented with his Purple Heart and then shipped out to Germany and eventually home to the U.S. As a result of his injuries, Pauley's army career was over and he was given a medical discharge. 'Helplessness' Coming to terms with that life-changing event was tough enough, but it was the "survivor's guilt" that played tricks with his mind and mental state. Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself. "I was just racked with guilt, in the sense that I failed as a leader and take responsibility for what happened." Pauley was in a bad place. His marriage would eventually break down. "It's a big challenge for returning veterans to learn how to integrate with their families," he admits. Now 38, he has two children, and his youngest -- his daughter -- was born five months after he was injured. "I battled three or four years of just helplessness, anxiety and depression, until I was introduced to the Wounded Warriors Project," Pauley says. Aimed at helping injured service members, and raising awareness in the community, it brought him together with Norbie Lara -- who also joined the army in the mid-1990s and who was also seriously wounded on duty. "He had such a positive attitude and he really encouraged me to turn my life around," Pauley says. Lara's arm had been severed when a rocket-propelled grenade pierced the armor plating of his vehicle.	1
An eastern Pennsylvania police chief who went on profanity-laced video rants against those who disagreed with him on gun laws has been suspended for 30 days without pay. The punishment wasn't for his diatribe though. The borough council in the coal town of Gilberton said that police Chief Mark Kessler used "borough property for non-borough purposes without prior borough permission" when he made the video where he's seen shooting semiautomatic and automatic weapons. Thousands of gun-rights activists descended on the town of 750 for the meeting, openly sporting firearms, CNN affiliate WPMT reported. "I make no apologies and I have no regrets," a defiant Kessler told the council after its 5-1 vote, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ. He added he would be back "30 days from tonight." Soon afterward, Kessler posted a statement on his website saying that Mayor Mary Lou Hannon and two council members -- Eric Boxer and Daniel Malloy -- "are conspiring behind closed doors for full termination. " "They needed to suspend first to allow themselves time to look for or make up any reason or lie," he said. Then, he added in all uppercase letters: "HEY BOXER, MALLOY , HANNON, YOU'RE COWARDS, YOU'RE HACKS, YOU PRETEND TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION,YOU SICKEN ME !" For her part, Mayor Hannon said the police chief has her backing. "He has the right to freedom of speech," she told WPMT. "I am a big supporter of the Constitution." Kessler posted his videos to YouTube in mid-July. They went viral, generating a heated online debate that appeared to gain renewed traction last month when he posted a backhanded apology. Kessler did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment, but he told WFMZ at the time that he was not in uniform in the videos and was exercising in his First and Second Amendment rights. In the videos, Kessler rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry over his support of a recent U.N. arms treaty. At one point in the video, he dares Kerry to come and take his guns. "It wasn't a threat. It was, 'if you want them come and take them,'" Kessler told the television station by telephone.	1
Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday. The plane, an  Egyptian Boeing 737, was on a domestic service to Cairo when it disappeared from radar screens on Friday night. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said Saturday that the investigation into the crash will be led by Egypt.Egypt, a strong supporter of the revolution that toppled long-time ruler Muammar Qaddafi, has repeatedly denounced the killing of a Libyan air force pilot as a crime against humanity. The jet’s four-man crew was traveling from Cairo to Tripoli when it went missing after departing from Tripoli at 7:25 p.m. Friday (1100 GMT Friday).The aircraft was flying an international route, with the destination of Cairo, when the pilot reported a malfunction in one of the plane’s four engines but continued as planned, said the source. It did not report the problem for an hour and when it landed as scheduled it was over Libya.“It took more than five hours before they could pinpoint the crash and it was late Friday afternoon now,” said the source, who added that the plane’s pilot reported several malfunctions during the flight. “The pilots were not sure that the one engine was malfunctioning, but the plane was on autopilot,” the source said, adding that the pilot did not report the malfunctions because he thought the plane was on autopilot.The jet was flying at between 90 and 100 percent capacity when it crashed, the source said, adding that the pilot did not say anything to his co-pilot on the flight because he did not want to disturb the flight crew. The co-pilot reported to the pilot in Tripoli that he heard a “noisy” engine, but did not know of any issues with it. The co-pilot saw one engine turn off while traveling but the pilot did not say anything to him, this source added.The pilot of the Afriqiyah Airways flight which crashed in Libya on Friday described on Saturday a night of “absolute terror” that gripped the plane as it flew from Benghazi to Cairo. It was only when the plane’s pilot called air traffic control for technical reasons that a search mission was launched, he said. The pilot said he	0
How can it be? The United States and Iran, sworn enemies for 35 years, are talking about working together to quell the al Qaeda-inspired insurgency sweeping northern Iraq. Such cooperation sounds unthinkable. They are fierce  rivals, and their long-running war in the Middle East has often stoked mutual mistrust and hatred.“I hope that’s a sign of something,” said U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday, with a smile. With just over three weeks to go until U.S. and Iranian leaders meet again in Switzerland for the annual U.N. General Assembly, the prospect of the two countries signing a deal to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) looms large.Although the Islamic State is a relatively insignificant player in the overall conflict against the Assad regime in Syria, it has left an indelible mark.Today ISIS has a presence across the Iraqi-Syrian border including the city of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city and the hometown of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It also has a foothold in parts of northern and central Syria, including the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, where it has gained territory and control over territory held by the YPG, a militia established in the late 1980s to protect the Kurds from oppression by Assad’s forces.The Islamic State’s growth has pushed the conflict in northern Syria towards its breaking point. U.S.-backed rebels, backed by Russia, have been on the offensive trying to capture Raqqa, ISIS’ former capital which is now under their control.If ISIS is wiped out from northern and eastern Syria in the coming days, the war will likely move north of the Syrian border into Iraq. ISIS’ defeat in Iraq could trigger a collapse of its hold on Mosul and the rise of their Syrian offshoot, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a militia that is dominated by jihadi zealots from the al Qaeda breakaway group, al-Nusra Front.Mapping the terrainAfter the Islamic State’s fall in Mosul and Syria’s defeat in Raqqa, the focus of attention will shift to northeastern Syria, where the United States is training and training local fighters to defend the Assad regime from any threat from the jihadi threat, particularly in Aleppo governorate, where the U.S. military has supported rebels since 2012	0
It turned out to be a duel between the young, reigning world champion and a motorcycling racing legend. The former won. Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP title of 2015 at the iconic Phillip Island circuit.We were in the paddock, so to speak, at Phillip Island this evening, one of the lastweeks before the start of Grand Prix motorcycle racing's premier season. The riders weregetting ready for a night race, which means that we were all at the paddock for a ratherearly dinner and after-dinner drinks, a practice I find somewhat odd, since practice runsare when you learn what works for you and what doesn't, and not when you go out toexercise to learn what suits you.It was a chilly evening, which meant a few riders were wearing gloves and helmets, butmost, by and large, were wearing their usual clothes, the ones we've all seen andaccepted as the norm. But still, in this, a year when helmets have become increasinglyimportant, the uniformity between riders and the lack of it, perhaps more than any otherfactor, make Phillip Island such an exciting place to be, especially for motorcycleracers. The last few years, our sport has gone by the wayside, just like everything elsein Australian life, and not just by the wayside, but in a way that makes it hard tobelieve. Where once we were a major player in world racing, now all we have is a placeon the grid that gives us a chance of winning races and qualifying, but doesn'tactually mean anything to me or to many of our riders.Phillip Island was also a perfect place to introduce some new riders to the sport,introducing Valentino Rossi, who was the first to ride the bike, and the second towin the race. While he may have won the whole thing, Valentino was very impressive,and had ridden the bike much further than most, both in terms of practice days andtraining days, and this was his first Grand Prix. He also rode the machine to verygood effect on the race track. Unfortunately, it was during the race that Valentinogot into an embarrassing scrap on the track with fellow Spaniard Marc Marquez, who wasalso winning the race.There were also	0
For the first time, Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics -- Wojdan Shaherkani and Sarah Attar, who will compete in judo and track and field. But their participation is far from a groundbreaking step for Saudi women. It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury. The issue has been resolved and she will participate in a form of headgear that complies with Saudi's strict Islamic dress codes for women. But if Shaherkani had withdrawn, it would not have been a setback for Saudi women because her inclusion was not a sign of advancement. The presence of Saudi women is the result of several months of pressure by the International Olympics Committee on Saudi Arabia to include women competitors or face being banned from participation. The situation for female athletes in Saudi Arabia is bleak. Saudi women in general are denied the right to practice sports. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that prevents girls from taking part in sports in government schools. Physical education is allowed only in private schools. Women are not allowed to play in official sports clubs or even watch matches in stadiums. Girls' football, volleyball and basketball games in private schools and colleges are held secretly. Because of this ban, finding women with Olympic level training was a kind of mission impossible. Only a few days before its July announcement that the two women would attend, the Saudi National Olympic Committee said it could not find a woman qualified enough to compete. Most Muslim-majority countries have sent female athletes to compete in the Olympics for decades. More Muslim women are competing in sports today than ever. But even when women are included, competition remains a challenge, particularly because of athletic dress codes. In 2007, the International Federation of Association Football issued a ban on the hijab or headscarf. But this year, FIFA has lifted the ban after testing new hijabs specifically designed for athletes. In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia.	1
The Syrian poet, critic and artist Adonis has been described as the greatest living Arab poet. He was the first Arab to win the German Goethe Prize last year at the age of 81, whose judges described him as "the most important Arab poet of our time," and he was one of the favorites to win last year's Nobel Prize for Literature. Adonis, born Ali Ahmad Said Esbar, grew up in a poor village near the Syrian city of Latakia and received no formal education until he was granted a scholarship to a French lycee by the then president of Syria at the age of 13. He was forced to leave Syria in 1956 after being imprisoned for his involvement in the opposition Syrian National Socialist Party. He moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and now lives in Paris and Beirut. He spoke to CNN through an interpreter at an exhibition of his collages and a series of literary events called "A Tribute to Adonis" at the Mosaic Rooms in London until March 30. CNN: How do you feel watching the situation in Syria? Adonis: I'm very sad. I wish that the regime would understand that it has to reform or renew itself and create a new government through free and fair elections. I also wish that the opposition had not resorted to armed violence because I'm personally against violence in all its forms. I do not see any justification for its use whatsoever. CNN: Should the outside world intervene in Syria? A: The world should not interfere, especially not militarily. The Western world should not use this as a pretext to fulfill its own goals in the region. More from Inside the Middle East: Filmmaker Nigol Bezian's tour of 'Little Armenia' in Beirut CNN: Are you in touch with friends in Syria? A: I last went to Syria a year and a half ago, but I'm always in touch with my friends there. Many of them are in the opposition -- but in the peaceful opposition. Many of them share my views that the solution must be Syrian and through a democratic dialogue. We must reach a new regime that is democratic, plural and secular. CNN: Are your friends scared? A: Their main fear is for the violence and for the potential for the situation to develop into civil war. They are not scared to speak out. They can talk openly.

A pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a gentlemen's club in New York. Jennifer Paviglianiti, of Centereach, N.Y., claims her employer, Café Royale, discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. She filed a claim with the EEOC earlier this month. Paviglianiti says she feared how her boss would react to her pregnancy and wanted to wait a few months to tell him. However, John Doxey found out before she could tell him, and that's when Paviglianiti claims her job became threatened. Up until she became pregnant, the 29-year-old says she had been one of the club's most popular bartenders. Read the complaint She says she "bonused 9 times" since August and it was only toward the end of her pregnancy that she asked for different hours. Due to the tough economy, Paviglianiti says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she'd soon be out of work. To protect herself, she decided to secretly record her boss on tape. On those recordings Doxey can be heard saying, "Customers don't wanna come in and see a pregnant woman behind the bar!" These recordings were also submitted in her EEOC discrimination claim. In other recordings, Doxey is heard suggesting that Paviglianiti's appearance is hurting business. "Maybe they don't go there because the bartender is pregnant and doesn't look sexy." Workplace attorney Robin Bond said it's within Doxey's right to do this if employees were informed that they had to maintain a specific "sexy look" to qualify for the job. In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a "model and a bartender" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos. When asked by Galanos if she signed any paperwork of that sort, Paviglianiti said, "not at all ... nothing." Paviglianiti was taken off the bartending schedule for a few weeks, during which she hired an attorney. She later returned to the club as a cashier but claims she made much less than she did as a bartender. However, Doxey's attorney says this proves she was never fired and her job duties were only adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy.	1
A cargo train derailed and crashed into homes Sunday in a izakayevka (a village with a population of about 2,000 in the southern Ural province, which borders Russia) in the Russian republic of Bashkiria. Four people were killed, including three children, according to Russian news agency cited by RT.The train was made up of freight cars and carried about 150 passengers, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported.The derailment occurred just outside izakayevka; it's unclear if the crash happened after leaving the station or as the train was passing through the village. Residents of izakayevka, many of them women, were sleeping when the incident occurred, with local emergency services not immediately taking charge.The disaster is likely part of a larger problem for Russia, where safety standards are poorly enforced, with a high number of train accidents, according to the World Health Organization.Russia has said over the last few months that there is insufficient fuel on the railway network to allow it to transport the thousands of passengers it's expected to receive to the Sochi Olympics. Many have expressed concerns that the transport of athletes might increase that risk, since the trains could be carrying some of Russia's high-profile athletes.The Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.Click for more from The New York Times.Click for more from The Washington Post.Click for more from Reuters.Click for more from The Canadian Press.Click for more from Bloomberg.Copyright 2011The Associated Press.

The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said. Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz says street level drug dealers are responsible for most recent violence there. Turf battles between rival drug cartels, and between authorities and cartels, have made Juarez one of the world's most dangerous cities. There were 305 drug-related killings in August, making it the deadliest month yet, according to the mayor's office. Most of the recent violence has been committed by young street-level drug dealers who work for the Sinaloa or Juarez cartels, Reyes Ferriz said. Adding deportees from the United States, some with criminal records, worsens the situation, the mayor said. In the past 45 days, 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years, Reyes Ferriz said. "We don't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not," he told CNN's Rick Sanchez this week. "We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails. They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States." Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally, but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs, which have networks in the United States, Reyes Ferriz said. But according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. agency that oversees deportations, the number of criminal deportees entering Juarez from El Paso, Texas, is not high. "El Paso had the fewest removals among the other border areas" in fiscal 2008, ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa said. About 85,400 "criminal aliens" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE. Of those deported through El Paso, about 6,800 were criminal aliens, Zamarripa said. The term refers to noncitizens who have been convicted of a crime in the United States. Illegal immigrants whose only violation is entering illegally are not classified as criminal aliens, Zamarripa said. Not all were Mexican, so not all left the United States by crossing into Juarez, she added.	1
Actor Anthony Mackie was arrested early Saturday for drunken driving in New York City, police said. The arrest happened at 1:22 a.m. in Harlem, Detective Brian Sessa told CNN. Mackie's camp did not immediately return a call later that day seeking comment. The celebrated actor in theater and television has starred in numerous films such as "The Hurt Locker," which won the best picture Academy Award in 2010.	1
The images of Haitian children crying or injured or wandering the streets alone are heartbreaking. It's no surprise there has been a flood of well-intentioned people who want to adopt those children. But that's not always the best immediate  step.For a country with a population of just over 10 million, Haiti has over 3 million orphans.One, a 3-year-old girl who was found by a group of community activists in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Orphanages there are overcrowded, even the orphanages themselves are overcrowded and the average age of the children who are in them is 7.Another, a 4-year-old girl who was found by a group of community activists in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Orphanages there are overcrowded, even the orphanages themselves are overcrowded and the average age of the children who are in them is 7.This means these two little girls have been orphaned by their own parents, who sent them off with the hopes that in a couple of years they would be able to take them home with them. Instead, they're here with us, and these girls will only be children for so long, before they become teenagers.And because this government is trying to adopt these two girls, we have to worry about it. They're not supposed to stay alive for another year. But they're still alive. And there's nothing we can do.These two girls, along with more than 400,000 more children in the country, are in need of a lot of help from their leaders, whether it's the leaders of the country or the rest of the international community.Haiti is in a place right now where it makes a lot of sense to step up, not just for the children, but for the country as a whole. The poverty that exists in Haiti is staggering. It is the highest in the Western Hemisphere, and it's got all the potential for social unrest, civil unrest, ethnic conflicts, and even an uprising. This is a country that has a real chance of erupting right now and causing a lot of problems.If the president and prime minister cannot even keep the country's children alive, how can they keep them fed and safe? How can they protect them from the very thing that keeps children alive and well?When they have kids, their role models are	0
The villagers had congregated at the tent, as they often did at the end of the workday, to sit and chat. Among them were men who sold vegetables or wood. Others mined or traded minerals used to make alloys like stainless steel.  As she stood by the open door of the tent, listening to their animated talk, Mrs. Zobel observed one of the women who had gone into the village to buy vegetables. She was a plump, middle-aged woman with thick, black, curly hair.Although the woman paid for her purchases with the most modest of currencies, in her eyes Mrs. Zobel saw a look of resentment. In fact, she was probably thinking of her husband back home in Germany.  Mrs. Zobel took one of the plastic bowls she had brought with her in the kitchen, filled it with soup, and carried it out to the woman."Can I take this out to you?" Mrs. Zobel asked.The woman looked at her suspiciously. "Sure," she said. "For what do I need it?""I need you to watch the kids," Mrs. Zobel explained. "I've got a little time this evening.""I'll watch the kids," the woman said. And with that she was lost in conversation with her neighbors. She had no desire, Mrs. Zobel thought, to talk about her husband or her poverty to anyone.Outside, a few yards away, a man worked in the garden."We have a good day today," he told her in German, as he held the sickle he had been using to cut a few weeds.  "Did you do that?" he asked her. "I would have done it earlier, but there is a storm coming.""Yes," Mrs. Zobel said. "Yes, I did it." She then put her arms around him. He was wearing green overalls and a green cap. His hair was a few shades of brown."Where do you come from?" she asked."From a village called Schlossbrücke," he replied. "The village is called Schlossbrücke, too." The man indicated the village by pointing toward the northwest corner of the yard. "Do you know it?""I think so," Mrs. Zobel	0
It was a very telling mini-scandal, the faux-fury over Michelle Obama's short visit to Saudi Arabia. First there was the phony claim that Saudi television had blurred the first lady's image in its transmission of the ersatz summit with King Abdullah (a man who was not in the country, and who was not present at the event) because she looked too big. Then there was the story, also faked, that ABC News tried to suppress information about the first lady's anti-war stance by "blowing" the issue and suppressing photos of her at the summit. Finally, there was the suggestion that the first lady was "under attack" from a group of radicals for her support of the war. It was a very, very disturbing spectacle.But while we were making our political capital from the first lady's visit, another mini-scandal was brewing within the White House, and it was very serious.That other scandal involved the "leaking" of a secret National Security Council document by "an unclassified official" after the president's briefing of the world leaders in the Rose Garden last week. That leak had been "suppressed" by the National Security Council's general counsel, Tom Ascol, who claims he was fired. Yet after he made the story public, the NSC released him, saying that he had resigned.I am no lawyer. I am not a prosecutor. However, it seems that a good lawyer might have told Mr. Ascol to go stick his head in the box and wait for the police officer to come busting in.President Bush did not fire him. Nor did the White House seek to destroy him. We don't want a lawyer who claims to have been fired by the President. If the President feels that his lawyer has lied (and if it looks like that might happen) then the President should say so. He may end up paying the lawyer's fees.But the real question is: Did Tom Ascol, a lawyer at the Department of Justice, use his legal skills to destroy the president's career? Did he actually give away the secret documents? Or did he simply suppress them?President Bush doesn't seem to be in the least bothered about this. "Don't worry about Tom Ascol," he said when the story broke on the Sunday talk shows: "I've got Tom Ascol." And he said, with more confidence than I would	0
A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday. A jury iced a verdict against two cigarette companies after a four-day trial that focused on the quality of defendant Marlboro cigarettes and their impact on Marlboro's longtime sales leader, Virginia Slims maker Camel Holdings.The plaintiff, the man’s second wife, testified jurors were not given enough time to decide all her claims against Camel and Marlboro, which had sued each other over the company's alleged violations of its trademark. But she was awarded $1.9 million in compensatory damages for her husband, said the attorneys, who asked that the case be sent back to a lower-court judge for reconsideration.“My client is angry because she had to wait six months to get all her damages,” said Matthew Reiss, who is among a group of lawyers representing all parties in the case that has been in dispute since 2008. “The delay is unacceptable and unfair to Mrs. Gartner.”Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe attorneys said they were pleased with the jury’s decision to award $1.9 million in damages, the amount that would be due if the trial were to go to a second jury. Judge Charles E. Butler ruled the compensatory damages were too high, but said he would send the case back to the lower-court judge for reconsideration after the jurors made sure they weren’t “double-billing” their deliberations, attorneys said.“They didn’t get to the bottom of all the issues in this case,” Reiss said. “They were confused and frustrated and decided the verdict was the limit.”The trial centered on the marketing of Marlboros, which are low-tar and virtually calorie-free, and a series of lawsuits by Camel and Marlboro in which it accused Camel of violating its trademark. A federal jury in Miami awarded $1.9 million to a widower of an 80-year-old widow, who said Camel violated the Lanham Act after the company refused to pay for an autopsy on her wife.	0
It's too easy to let New Mexico off as simply "The Land of Enchantment." It's true the state has magical desert vistas, Rocky Mountain playgrounds and charming adobe vernaculars, but the allure of the state's vistas, its mountains, its desert and its people can be found in three places at one time: along the Pacific Rim and the Santa Fe Trail, or in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The land can surprise you with the way it looks: It's a land of cliffs, canyons, high desert and vast plains that can be walked on in just a few hours.The vastness and beauty are also not surprising, and at the same time, they're the real reason New Mexico is so good to explore. The area is not big but it is expansive; its many rivers and creeks will take you deep into the heart of a mountain, and its many lakes and reservoirs take you deep into the heart of a desert with just a brief drive to the next town. The great beauty of New Mexico is its flexibility.The history of New Mexico is a part of its landscape and culture. It is a place where the first European settlers first ventured into an ungoverned and foreign territory. The land of the Navajo, once considered a wild and mysterious land, has been settled and tamed by settlers and by the various Indian nations.A land of stunning beauty also reveals a history, the story of this region by those who have come before them.The first European to come to the land was an adventurer, explorer and soldier named Juan Manuel Duarte. He was the first to conquer territory in what is now the state of New Mexico. He was a general in the Spanish army.In 1598, he built Casa Vieja (Old House) at Santa Fe, which was the first permanent European settlement in the territory of what would later be New Mexico. He also built the first church in the area, which is still standing today. To this day, Casa Vieja is the oldest standing church in the United States. The church is the oldest church in Santa Fe, and the oldest building in the United States.The Spanish had set the gold standard for how the United States was to be governed by building a city and setting up a government for their new land. The Spanish were welcomed by the Alburquerque family, who started the Santa Fe Trail	0
Police in Brazil say they have arrested a fourth person in connection with the March 30 rape of an American woman and the beating and robbery of her French boyfriend Ã¢â‚¬â€ all while she had yet to tell anyone what was happening to her.At a news conference, police said that they arrested the suspect, 27-year-old Marcelo D'Amorim, who had traveled from France to Brazil.D'Amorim is accused of raping the woman and robbing her partner, the boyfriend, of almost $7 million and three motorcycles. He is said to have admitted to the crimes and will be held until he has been charged during his next court appearance.D'Amorim is being held in a prison in Caruaru, a city about 55 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. According to a statement put out by police, D'Amorim is a former drug user and has shown signs of mental instability.D'Amorim is a former drug user and has shown signs of mental instability.The news came less than a month after a Brazilian woman who had just been released from prison for killing three members of an illegal cartel in their hometown of Aragua state was killed in an apparent drug-related drug attack.The attacks occurred a little more than a week after a man was shot dead in broad daylight on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, apparently as part of a drug dispute.The woman was on her way back from a court appearance on Sunday when she was ambushed and killed.The woman who was killed in Rio is said to have been the wife of a politician and was working as a secretary at the presidential palace.Brazil's president, Dilma Cristina, has promised increased police and anti-drug measures in response to the spate of killings. But she faces a hostile Congress that is eager to get rid of her, at least in part, because of her socialist policies.Meanwhile, President Joao Doria has announced the creation of a special team of prosecutors and a special court to deal with such cases.The Brazilian government appears to be taking a number of measures. Earlier this week, the government announced a series of measures to combat violence against women and a crackdown on sex trafficking.Brazil's government appears to be taking a number of measures.

American Steve Stricker clinched a one-shot victory on the final day of the John Deere Classic to win the event in Illinois for the third year in a row. The 44-year-old  Stricker was tied neck and neck with Gary Brown for three holes with most of the leaders making birdies. Stricker began the closing stretch with a birdie on the 17th, but a poor shot on the 18th forced him to settle for par. Stricker made a birdie on the 11th and a  four on the 15th to secure his one-shot victory.Stricker was also the first John Deere Classic champion since Tom McEwen in 1999.Source: John Deere ClassicDay 2Saturday, January 15, 2002Round 1Sunday, January 16, 2002Round 1Monday, January 17, 2002Round 1Source: John Deere ClassicReferencesExternal links John Deere Classic 2002 official siteCategory:John Deere ClassicJohn Deere ClassicJohn Deere Classic 2002John Deere Classic 2002John Deere Classic 2002John Deere ClassicJohn Deere ClassicCategory:Sprint courses in the United StatesCategory:Sports venues in IowaCategory:Defunct horse racing venues in IowaCategory:Sports venues completed in 1999Category:1999 establishments in IowaCategory:2002 disestablishments in IowaCategory:Defunct sports venues in IowaCategory:Defunct sports venues in the United StatesCategory:Aerobic dance competitionsCategory:Dance venues in the United StatesCategory:Music venues in IowaCategory:Rock Climbing Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer OlympicsCategory:Olympic gymnastics venuesCategory:Indoor arenas in IowaCategory:Indoor track and field venuesJohn Deere Classic 2002Category:Mt.

Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry. Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents.  What the hell is going on?! Obama wants to run for president and will probably win. He will be elected president in 2012, and if he is the Democratic party nominee it will be in the presidential election of 2016!  The Democratic Party is now in total disarray and Obama's supporters will be out in force. People will be shouting about how he wants to take America back!  He wants to return us to a time when people did not have to worry about losing their jobs or their homes. A time when people did not have to worry about the health care they need or the insurance they have. He wants us back to the days when you could buy a new car every year, and when buying a new car was a simple, inexpensive procedure.  And he wants us back to the days when we did not have to worry about having to work more, because we had enough money to retire earlier. We had more disposable income than we had even 20 years ago.  So, what is going on?  Obama is running for president. His name is on the ballot in 2012. His approval is at 50 percent. He is the most popular person in America, outside of Hollywood, and he had a good poll in his favor.  What is wrong with this picture?  There are a multitude of issues, but I think two issues are at the core of what is wrong with this picture.  The first is that Obama wants to run for president even though his approval rating is at 50 percent.  The second is that Obama's supporters will be out in force. The people will be shouting about how he wants to take America back!  The Democratic party has been in disarray for over six years. The old guard who made up the party have thrown it into disarray. The new voters, who are largely African-Americans, are not happy with a party that has become irrelevant. The party has lost over 60,000 members in the last two election cycles.  It is more important to Obama's political career that the party be successful than that it is not irrelevant. He wants to run for	0
When Japanese police arrested three sumo wrestlers and their stable master on Thursday over allegations they beat a 17-year-old wrestler to death, the case sent shockwaves across a country that links its national identity to the ōzeki. The allegations came after the Sumo Association investigated the death, and a spokesman for its president said he found that the wrestler's death was "institutionalized."The wrestlers, two of whom were under 20 and the third in his late 20s, were arrested on charges of negligent homicide. The stable master was arrested on charges of assault.The wrestler died on April 13 during two days of "shooting," during which the wrestlers beat him during practice and after he fought off a wrestler known as "Bengoshi" (Bengoshi no Sumo, or "Bad Boy") and knocked him out. The wrestler's name was not released, but his family has been identified.Japan's Sumo Association confirmed the arrest of three wrestlers on Thursday"In the past week, when Bengoshi no Sumo was arrested on charges of assault, his case was dismissed by the Sumo Association," a spokesperson for the association said Friday. "The victim was found to be criminally responsible." The spokesman also said the sumo association would "prosecute the case."The incident happened during a tournament for new wrestlers, which are only put through practice and training for a few days before the upcoming tournament. Bengoshi was put through a grueling training regime that included a series of "shooting" moves to make him more dangerous for his opponents.His death sparked outrage in Japan, where wrestlers have traditionally been admired for their physical strength and prowess. His father, a teacher, has denounced Bengoshi as a "coward.""We lost our son for nothing," his father, Shingo Suzuki, told a public broadcaster in an emotional speech on Friday. "The most unfortunate thing is, that all three of them were under 20 years old, and they are also under the law. When a wrestler is arrested for beating a wrestler, the punishment is a long prison sentence. And we are now going to take a long prison sentence, too."Suzuki has asked police to release Bengoshi and the two other wrestlers. The two under-20 wrestlers arrested could each face 10 years in prison if convicted."When it comes to the case of Bengoshi no	0
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday passed the GOP leadership's 2013 budget plan -- a measure that has no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate but creates a clear contrast between the two parties on a number of ills facing Main Street.The $3.7 trillion bill would set a record spending level for next year and, when coupled with the $85 billion Medicare fraud bill, would amount to a $1 trillion program that is projected to explode the federal deficit to a record $1.77 trillion by 2017, according to the CBO.The legislation, which the House passed with a party-line vote of 240 to 189, would prevent the expiration of the program that provides government-funded health care for the elderly and disabled. It would continue the tax breaks and subsidies that have made health insurance premiums for the elderly and disabled among the lowest in the industrialized world.It would also continue the tax breaks and subsidies that have allowed Medicare to pay doctors far less than the country's top five health care providers and to underwrite medical care to the tune of $1.2 trillion per year.That's a lot of money for the poor and middle class to have to cover in order to keep their health care options open.The package also keeps in place a payroll tax cut for middle-income workers, which has been the key to extending the payroll tax cut that started in 2001, after Republicans took charge of Congress in the 2006 elections to ensure that a payroll tax cut would keep the lights on for working families.And it increases the mortgage-interest deduction to $2,400 for individuals and $4,400 for families, which further undercuts the tax benefits for homeownership, as well.So the House Republican budget, which was passed with a solid but bipartisan majority, would:-- Cut spending by $1.7 trillion over the next decade, which is more than the entire federal budget for the prior 10 years -- $5.7 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO.-- Cut the Medicaid entitlement program by more than $300 billion over 10 years, with the goal of reducing the number of people who are eligible for the program by one-third by 2027.-- Provide $90 billion in funding to the Community Development Block Grant program to help cities and regions build and staff community-based organizations that promote economic opportunities for minority and low-income communities.	0
We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage. The city seemed so upbeat when we arrived Saturday morning on one of the first  buses on an eight-hour journey to where we would be staying, but we knew it was far from where it used to be.I will always remember the way everyone in Port-au-Prince seemed to be talking about "the quake," as if it were somehow the only thing that had happened that week. The city was back to its usual self on Saturday afternoon, but the tragedy was not.This is where it all started to disappear. As it became clear just after 10:00 a.m. that there would be a large, powerful earthquake, I knew that I needed to leave Haiti after the quake. I had told our driver to get off the bus in the worst affected area of the city, and I would be staying in the same neighborhood as the rest of our group. But after we had been there for several hours, the roads were still relatively clear as we stopped to wait for the bus to leave, and our driver told us we could join most of the other buses leaving the area. So our bus left with only a few passengers at 3 o'clock that afternoon—a small band that included our driver, our housekeeper and our translator.I stayed at a lovely hotel in the business district until Sunday night while our housekeeper made dinner and cleaned up. I had just turned off the television when I fell asleep at 1 a.m. Saturday evening. I woke up early Sunday morning and continued to sleep in until the moment the first plane flew in out of the airport, then headed to the airport with the rest of the group and we all loaded onto first available flight to Boston.The quake did not spare Port-au-Prince. It was much worse in many areas of central Haiti. A major earthquake that may have been as large as magnitude 8.0 occurred at 5:51 p.m. local time (18:51 Universal Time), and it hit at 7:14 p.m. (19:14 UW), with a 5.6 magnitude quake and a depth of 9.3 kilometers (5.8 miles). An 8.0 magnitude quake occurred at 6:57 p.m. (18:57) and a 5.6 at 7:31 p	0
Just four days after winning her fifth Wimbledon crown, Serena Williams overcame the effects of jet lag to successfully begin the defense of her Bank of the West Classic title in Stanford, California. The American urn, which she had won seven times, was a major source of inspiration for the American, who used it as a springboard for her career. Williams also made a quick appearance at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she played her doubles match with sister Venus.Williams is currently ranked number one in the world, with her only loss coming to Novak Djokovic after three sets, which put her into the top ten for the first time in her career. She has reached the finals on the main stage of a Grand Slam tournament 20 times, and has claimed three major titles at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, and the Australian Open.On August 16, Williams lost in the third round of the 2016 U.S. Open at the hands of Caroline Wozniacki. According to the Washington Post, "A wild second set, in which Williams made several unforced errors, sent her trailing 6-3, 6-3. She was well behind in a tough set against an opponent who is playing her first Grand Slam tournament, and the pressure was on."Williams is currently coached by John McEnroe, former coach of Australian Bob Hewitt in the 1950s.Williams is also a member of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA), as well as the U.S. Open Board of Directors.Career statisticsGrand Slam eventsSingles: 22–12Grand Slam finalsSingles: 39 (25 titles, 14 runner-ups)Mixed doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)Year-End Championships finalsSingles: 12 (7 titles, 5 runner-ups)Grand Slam statisticsSingles majors in a single seasonBig Four tournamentsSingles: 7 (4 titles, 3 runner-ups)Top-10 winsHead-to-head recordWilliams' best mark over her head-to-head opponents was in the 2015 Australian Open, where she lost to Caroline Garcia in three sets.

Remember that goofy uncle of yours who always tried to impress you by "stealing your nose" or pulling the ol' separating-his-thumb-from-his-hand move? Well, those parlor tricks are nothing compared to the appendage stunts pulled by these 10 famous people. John Wilkes Booth's neck bones A painting of Napoleon in His Study by Jacques-Louis-David doesn't give a hint at what body part went missing. John Wilkes Booth might have been a successful assassin, but he was a largely ineffectual escape artist. Just 12 days after murdering President Abraham Lincoln, Booth was shot in the back of the neck and killed. His body was (eventually) buried in an unmarked grave at Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery. His third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae, however, were removed during the autopsy so investigators could access the bullet. For a peek at those bits of Booth's spinal column, just check out the display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Einstein's brain Before he died, über-genius Albert Einstein considered donating his body to science. Unfortunately, he never put his wishes in writing. When he passed away in 1955, Einstein's family and friends made plans to cremate him, but the pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Thomas Harvey, had a different idea. Instead, he opted to remove the math man's brain and then tell the family about it. For 30-some years, Harvey had Al's gray matter tucked away in his Wichita home in two Mason jars. Naturally, Einstein's loved ones weren't thrilled when they found out, but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination. Today, many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions, with the bulk held at Princeton Hospital. As for Einstein's body, that was cremated and scattered in a secret location. "Stonewall" Jackson's arm Confederate General Thomas Jackson got his nickname by sitting astride his horse "like a stone wall" while bullets whizzed around him during the Civil War. But that kind of bravery (or foolhardiness) didn't serve him well. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson was accidentally shot in the arm by one of his own men.	1
Pakistan's much-awaited military offensive in North Waziristan was launched more than a week ago, and followed an attack on Karachi airport that left at least 36 people dead. Due to the strategic calculations of the Pakistani state, North  Waziristan is Pakistan's most important military and intelligence agency, and it is the most important factor in the country's military balance.That has not gone unnoticed by the United States. US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Elizabeth Taylor says, "The Pakistanis consider a successful operation in North Waziristan a threat to their military. They see it as a sign of weakness because they do not want to see the United States come into the war in the region."But how did the United States know of the military offensive in North Waziristan? How did the United States know for how long? And how can the US counter this? The answer is that the American public needs to be told.When the Pakistani state publicly announced the offensive, US President Barack Obama said at the time that "as we move to take the fight to al-Qaida, al-Qaida knows the Pakistani military isn’t going to fight them off, and that will make it harder to find and kill and capture terrorists in the future." The Pakistanis had asked the US in September to increase the US military presence in North Waziristan, but the US had been reluctant to do so and had said the presence of US troops would be required to build the military presence in North Waziristan.In October, the US and Pakistan signed a deal on a "transition plan" that would see 1,500 US soldiers leave Afghanistan, with an option for a further 2,000 soldiers to be deployed. In return, Pakistan agreed to increase the number of US drone aircraft and to expand the US military presence in South Waziristan and North Waziristan.When the Pakistani army attacked North Waziristan this past week, it was clearly a violation of the agreement. What did not make the announcement by the Pakistani state known to the public was that the military offensive would be for two nights.The US announced that the offensive would be a "two-pronged operation" aimed at "destroying" al-Qaida and "maintaining a safe and secure environment for the United States and our troops."The Pakistani state announced the offensive	0
The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia. Lane was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. Three teenagers have been charged as adults in his killing. In Ada, Oklahoma, Lane was remembered as a popular athlete, well-liked by classmates and considered a model student by professors. "Chris exemplified what a student-athlete is all about," said East Central University President John R. Hargrave in a statement Wednesday. "We will miss Chris, not only for his presence, but the impact he has made on fellow students and athletes." 'Senseless' shooting sparks call for U.S. boycott People who never met him have turned to social media and the Internet to share their feelings of the tragedy. The emotions range from shock and sadness to rage and disbelief. That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia. The goal of the "Christopher Lane Fund" was to collect $15,000. The total now exceeds $60,000. Some of the donations are accompanied by statements shared on the site. "As a citizen of the United States, I am saddened, embarrassed, and appalled by the unconscionable act that took Christopher's life," wrote one contributor, Judy Harless. "I pray for your family, and Christopher, in the hopes that you may find peace after this tragedy. I also pray for our leaders that they find the strength and morality to implement gun laws that prevent such senseless acts and, lastly, for our youth who do not value life, are devoid of compassion, and have no humanity." Another contributor, Richard Kimpel, put the blame for the "senseless tragedy" on "a society that allows so many young boys to grow up without being taught respect for life. I am so so sorry for your loss. Please find some comfort in knowing that he is in good company with the Lord now." People have also turned to Twitter to express their feelings, including Los Angeles Dodgers player Peter Moylan. An Australian, Moylan tweeted: "Tonight I continued my dream of playing pro baseball, a dream that was stolen from Chris Lane by 3 cowards."	1
better known by his aww-shucks, all-American nickname, Johnny Football -- was not allowed to give any interviews, in accordance with head coach Kevin Sumlin's rules for all freshmen players. Once the regular season ended, and Johnny Football hysteria hit its height, Sumlin lifted the ban. Finally, a chance to get to know more about the superstar quarterback about whom, despite all his nationally televised on-field fireworks, so much was still shrouded in pigskin-scented mystery. "What will he say?" "What's he like?" Eager fans and sports writers couldn't wait for the public Johnny Football to emerge. And he did --uneventfully -- on November 26, 2012. But now, after another scandal in an offseason that has been too eventful,  Manziel and fans alike may have been better off with the Private Johnny Football. On Sunday it was revealed that Manziel is the subject of an NCAA investigation for possibly being paid to autograph football memorabilia, which would violate the NCAA's rules prohibiting athletes from making money by "promoting or advertising the commercial sale of a product or service." And so Johnny Football's roller coaster of unprecedented success and relentless scandal continues. Here's a recap of some of his other highs and lows. February 2, 2011: The highly recruited quarterback officially signs with Texas A&M. Manziel was the nation's 14th-ranked QB prospect and agrees to take a redshirt his freshman season. June 29, 2012: Manziel is arrested in College Station, Texas, after a bar fight. He's charged with fighting, failure to identify and possession of fake IDs. November 11, 2012: Manziel leads Texas A&M to the biggest upset of the college football season, beating Alabama 29-24. Manziel throws for 253 yards and two touchdowns and rushes for another 93 yards. Johnny Football Fever spreads across the country. December 8, 2012: Manziel becomes the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, after a record-breaking season during which he threw for 3,706 yards and ran for 1,410 and 21 touchdowns. Fellow Heisman finalist Manti Te'o said the dual-threat Manziel "is a human video game." December 24, 2012: Manziel plays golf with Jonas Brothers Joe and Nick. Whether this is a high or a low depends on your radio presets.	1

MotoGP championship leader Casey Stoner claimed his 10th pole position of 2011 on Saturday to boost his bid for a ninth victory this season at the Japan Grand Prix. After 14 of 18 meetings, the Australian holds a 44-point lead over world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who will start Sunday's race second on the grid for Yamaha at Motegi. He broke Lorenzo's 2008 lap record with a time of one minute 45.267 seconds to earn his first pole at the circuit, where he won last year's race. Stoner's teammate Andrea Dovizioso qualified third ahead of another Honda rider, Dani Pedrosa, while American Ben Spies claimed fifth for Yamaha. Honda's Marco Simoncelli completed the third row for Honda, while fellow Italian and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was seventh for Ducati. Hiroshi Aoyama, in 11th, was the highest-placed Japanese rider for what will be an emotional day. Motorcycling's top names had initially refused to travel to Motegi due to health fears after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was damaged during March's earthquake and tsunami. They backed down after MotoGP officials refused to cancel the race, but Stoner arrived late to reduce any exposure to radiation and Lorenzo told reporters that he had been washing with bottled water despite experts insisting the Motegi area is safe from any fallout. But the riders have helped raise $140,000 for the "We are for Japan" campaign, with Aoyama to present the check to local officials before the race. "Everything has gone very well so far this weekend. We've been fastest in all but one session, so it's been fantastic," 2007 world champion Stoner told the MotoGP website. "We'll have to watch the weather as this will affect the set-up. There's also a chance of rain, so it could get complicated. Jorge has been riding fantastic, as has Dovi and Dani, but there is no doubt that the Honda suits this track."	1
Veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled the World Cup scoring record of Brazilian great Ronaldo to rescue a point for Germany in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza Saturday. The 36-year-old had only just iced a penalty kick that sealed a win over the United States in Fortaleza two years ago on April 6, 2006. Klose, who captained Hamburg to the German Cup title in 2008, is an eight-time German champion, but this season, that has to be seen to be believed. “When you look at someone such as Klose and the way he works, it’s incredible and I would like to be that good,” said German midfielder Sami Khedira in an ESPN interview. “I think he has it.” “I don’t want to look in the mirror and be like, ‘This isn’t me.’ Because I don’t look like that anymore,” he added. “I look like I’m in great shape and I can play much better,” he said.A year ago, German forward Thomas Muller was on Klose’s radar, but the latter took his time coming to a decision. The forward scored 18 goals in the Bundesliga last season to help Stuttgart to a fifth-place finish. “If I get a chance to be like this, then I’ll take it,” the striker told ESPN. “I had this dream a long time ago to perform like this. I’m very, very happy and lucky.”Klose had said he was open to playing abroad at some point, but he has not ruled out staying in Germany for the rest of his career. Hamburg have a transfer ban hanging over them, but it is unclear whether Klose has any interest in a return to his homeland. “I’ll have to sit down with my agent,” he said, “see what’s happening in Germany and maybe return there, but right now, I’m happy and excited about what I’m doing.” Klose has been in the headlines recently, with a high-altitude skydive and a reported $150 million offer from FC Dallas.Germany vs. Ghana, March 30, 2016 | Photo by	0
Zara brushes her dark brown curls away from her face, nose scrunched up in concentration as she stares at the white board. She looks down to write and then pauses, placing her little finger on her chin in contemplation. Like a typical 7-year-old, her favorite part about school is the games. "Hide and seek," she says in English, giggling sheepishly. "I like hide and seek." But no matter how hard she tries, there are some things this little girl and her friends can't hide from. "I am scared from the bombs," she sighs. "I am very afraid." Read Arwa Damon's blog entry about the children of Peshawar on Afghanistan Crossroads Zara lives in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, tucked right up against the Khyber Pass next to Afghanistan. When the Pakistani military began its multiple offensives targeting its own homegrown militant networks in the tribal belt, the retaliation was felt in Peshawar. It was the residents of this ancient city of 3 million who bore the brunt of an ongoing brutal bombing campaign. Suddenly nothing was safe. People's lives were shattered as the city found itself at the very core of Pakistan's war on terror. A truck bomb in a popular marketplace frequented by women and children killed more than 100 people. Checkpoints sprang up all over the city, meant to instill a sense of security. But at the same time they created targets of opportunity as they and government buildings were regularly attacked. Zara's school is tucked way down an alley off what once was Peshawar's most popular modern market street. Just out front sits a checkpoint. These days her school door remains bolted, the bus drivers act as additional guards and parents are discouraged from coming. The school administration wants as few adults loitering around as possible, afraid of suicide bombers. But there is little the school can do to keep the children safe from the demons that haunt them. "When there is an explosion," Zara says, pausing before she continues, "it feels like the Taliban are here. I imagine corpses are all lying on the ground." Her eyes widen and she giggles. "I get scared." She may be laughing, but psychiatrists say it's deadly serious: The children are confronting a faceless and unknown enemy.	1
Great Britain's rhythmic gymnastics team has won an appeal against a decision by its own federation to exclude them from the London 2012 Olympics. British Gymnastics ruled that the team had missed an agreed qualifying standard at the Olympic test event in North Greenwich area January. But the team appealed to independent arbitrator Sports Resolutions UK, who overturned the decision Monday. The British Olympic Association has now to inform the world governing body of gymnastics, the FIG, that Britain will be taking up the host nation spot. The argument between the rhythmic gymnastics squad and its federation centered on the target of 45.223 points. The British team fell agonizingly short of that mark in qualifying where it was intended to be met to mirror the Olympic experience. But in the final day of the test event, the team scored 47.200 and appealed the decision on that basis. Team captain Rachel Smith said they will now focus on making Britain "proud" at the summer Games. "We went into the competition thinking we could get the score on three days and we're really sad that it happened but on the bright side it has raised the profile of the sport," she told the Press Association. "We want to prove to everyone that we do deserve to be there and to make the country proud." British Gymnastics has accepted the appeal decision.	1
A diabetes test that measures a person's average blood glucose control over the preceding two to three months is being recommended as the new diagnostic tool for the condition. Diabetics have too much glucose in their blood when the condition is uncontrolled, and must monitor it. A committee of international experts recommended the test, called the the A1C assay, at the American Diabetes Association's 69th Scientific Sessions over the weekend. The report could instigate a change in the way diabetes is diagnosed, the American Diabetes Association said. The A1C assay, which has been used for nearly 30 years to determine how well a patient controls diabetes, is a more stable, reliable diagnostic tool than the techniques currently in use, the authors of the report said. "This committee that I chaired is recommending that this be used as widely as possible to diagnose diabetes instead of the blood sugar test," said Dr. David Nathan, director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and chairman of the committee. The A1C test, which consists of a simple blood test, is also more convenient than the two tests commonly used for diabetes -- the fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test -- the authors said. In the fasting test, the patient does not eat for about 12 to 14 hours before a blood test. In the tolerance test, the patient drinks a sweet solution and has blood drawn two hours later. In addition, Nathan said, "It probably is better related to the development of eye disease with diabetes, and therefore probably serves as a better diagnostic tool." The international committee was assembled by the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, but those organizations have not officially endorsed the report. "Basically, the American Diabetes Association supports the concept, supports the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes, and just has to look at the implications of it, and the implementation of it," said Richard Kahn, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer for the American Diabetes Association, who was part of the committee. Using A1C in diagnosis would be particularly useful for determining whether patients have type 2 diabetes, which is more difficult to diagnose than type 1, said Dr. William Bornstein, assistant professor of endocrinology at Emory University, who was not part of the committee. "This will be beneficial to the population in terms of helping us more clearly diagnose folks who are at risks for complications and help them manage that earlier," Bornstein said.	1
Judging from the yells and sounds of breaking glass, security guard Richard Shanley thought there was a fight at Summer Bay Resorts' building 104 on Sunday night. Then he listened a little closer. "I hear people coming out and hollering, 'The building is coming apart!' At that time, I looked down the breezeway, and I could literally see the building coming down in pieces," Shanley recalled to CNN on Tuesday. That's when Shanley, who'd been flagged down by one of the guests, hustled door to door, waking guests up to ensure everyone left the building's 24 vacation villas as windows cracked and parts of the building separated. Sinkhole eating family out of house and home Later that night, much of the three-story structure collapsed into a sinkhole at the central Florida resort near Walt Disney World. The sinkhole -- 110 to 120 feet wide and about 15 feet deep, according to an on-site expert -- swallowed a number of rooms and, with them, clothing and other belongings that the harried guests left behind. But no one was injured, earning Shanley praises from managers of the resort in Clermont, near Orlando. "I'm proud of his quick thinking and responsiveness," the resort's executive vice president, Juan Barillas, told reporters Tuesday morning. One end of the building -- which had held two-bedroom, two-bathroom villas -- still stands, but the rest has become a heap of debris. A guest in another building, Ben Warrick of Des Moines, Iowa, caught the collapse on video camera, showing part of the structure, already cracked and separated from the rest, falling with a loud rumble in the dark of night. Most of the resorts' hundreds of other guests were unaffected -- two other structures were evacuated as a precaution, and the power and gas service that had been cut in some other villas was restored by Tuesday morning. The other bit of relatively good news? There weren't any noticeable changes between Monday and Tuesday, Doug Yovaish, an expert hired by the resort, told CNN around 5 p.m. Tuesday. Still, many of the evacuated guests were without important belongings, such as passports -- items that resort officials say probably won't be recovered. The Red Cross was helping 17 families who were staying at the resort with food and clothing through gift cards. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly	1
Dozens of protesters were injured Sunday by Yemeni security forces as thousands packed into anti-government demonstrations, witnesses and medical personnel said. Witnesses said some others were arrested, but officials  could not confirm that.The demonstrators are demanding the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and are calling for him to step down amid rampant corruption, economic stagnation and a lack of democracy in the impoverished North African country.The government of Saleh, who is in power since 1978, has not been seen in public since an attempted military coup last August.The protests, which began on Friday and spread into the country's capital, Yarmouk, were the latest in a string of similar demonstrations by Yemenis to protest their worsening condition.According to witnesses, security forces in the capital clamped down on the protests with tear gas and fired a live bullet at the protesters, wounding two. The shooting occurred at the end of a march by hundreds of thousands of Yemenis in the southern port city of Aden.Sunday's clashes were the most violent since the start of the four-month-old demonstrations, and occurred just as thousands of protesters returned to the streets in the southern city of Aden.The protesters, who had marched toward the U.N. headquarters in Aden, were demanding the resignation of Saleh.On Sunday afternoon, the military council that rules Yemen, a step away from Saleh, said the president should step down. The news came after security forces fired live rounds in the air at protesters outside the U.N. headquarters in Aden, witnesses and medical workers said Saturday.Witnesses, however, said the shooting, which took place as the protesters were returning to the streets in Aden, was in response to anti-government protesters throwing stones.One witness said the protesters were returning to the streets after the security forces shot tear gas at them. The protester was treated for tear gas inhalation and airway obstruction, according to Yemeni medical officials.Tensions in YemenProtests against the president erupted in April. Over the past four months, the demonstrations have reached their highest peak with more than 60,000 taking part.The anti-government protests began as the first in the impoverished country and quickly spread to other parts of the country.Opposition to the government in Yemen has been fueled by a combination of frustration	0
President Obama said that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, "acted stupidly" in arresting a prominent black Harvard professor last week after a confrontation at the man's home. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.  said he wasn‘t arresting the man, who's the executive director of one of only two historically black colleges in the country, but rather just “asking him to calm down.”So, the question I've gotten several times now: Why is Harvard doing that?Why is the president, in announcing that the president of Harvard is doing something that, as far as he knows, is perfectly legal, not mentioning that this happened after he spoke with police about this issue?A:The "why?" here is primarily because of the reaction of the public outrage that followed the incident (and the outrage of the police). It was a widely covered event, with extensive attention on the issue, so much so that news organizations had stories to cover. And when the university (and the Harvard administration) reacted to the news coverage by releasing a statement claiming that nothing illegal happened (with the exception of the interaction on campus), most people were in the same situation. The Harvard administration wanted to get on the news right away, the police wanted to calm things down, and the Harvard community (a sizable number of people in this country) were outraged (even if somewhat apoplectic).A:If you were a professor at Harvard, would you have done anything differently?If by "nothing", you mean "nothing unlawful", no, you probably would still have done nothing.You do not need to arrest someone merely because they are black. If they were harassing you, you could have taken them into custody, and if the police would not have shown restraint and taken them into custody (which they did not), then you would not have done anything (besides perhaps reporting the incident to the police).If you think this is an incident, or incident, worth reporting as part of the Cambridge Police report, then you can find information on that on the Cambridge police website. A:I think you are a little confused with what the President of Harvard means here.By definition, "police action" is any response to a call for assistance. There is nothing illegal about the action.In the President of Harvard's opinion, the actions by the police were not justified (in his	0
The celebratory champagne should be well-chilled by now. After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more than 200 eager United Airlines passengers from Houston to Chicago. It promises to be a morning full of festivities, starting with a ribbon-cutting before the plane departs Bush Intercontinental Airport at 7:20 a.m. The aircraft touches down two and a half hours later at O'Hare International Airport, greeted by a water cannon salute. United says the 787 -- the airline has ordered 50 -- will "revolutionize the flying experience for our customers and crew while delivering unprecedented operating efficiency, comfort and lower emissions." The Dreamliner saves airlines money on fuel because its body is made from lightweight composite materials. It features passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation. U.S. routes announced for 'sports car in the sky' Sunday's flight crew won't need to kick the nose gear tires, size 40x16.0 R16/26PR to be exact, before taking off. United received the Dreamliner flying Sunday on September 28. It was put through the paces in October before earning Federal Aviation Administration certification. "Everyone's very excited, even people who aren't in the industry," Phil Derner, founder of the aviation news site NYCAviation.com, told CNN in August. "There's a ton of new technology on the 787. It's efficient and performs well, and it's also a very good-looking aircraft. It's kind of like a sports car in the sky." In September 2011, Japan's All Nippon Airways became the first carrier to receive the plane, which was three years overdue at that time. Because of unexpected delivery delays, during November and December some domestic flights originally scheduled to use the 787 will operate with a different aircraft type, United said. United says its Dreamliners will include 36 first-class seats, 70 premium-economy seats and 113 economy seats. It recently received its second 787. CNN's Thom Patterson and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.	1
In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Ã¢ÂÂ even though this is about as important as the dinner itself Ã¢ÂÂ for no other reason than the press would have asked.In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner Ã¢ÂÂ uninvited, the White House claims Ã¢ÂÂ declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Ã¢ÂÂ even though this is about as important as the dinner itself Ã¢ÂÂ for no other reason than the press would have asked.According to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, the couple was "at Obama's beck and call" to speak with him."I was sitting in my office for the entire evening trying to make sense of everything," Issa told Newsweek after the dinner. "I was not making sense at all."The dinner was hosted by the White House to celebrate the president's first visit to Asia. The president met with an assortment of dignitaries including the chairman of South Korea's intelligence agency, while the president's wife and daughter, both daughters of heads of state, were guests of the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.In a statement released by the White House the day after the meeting, the "President and First Lady met with the prime minister of Japan and the chairman of South Korea's intelligence agency to discuss strengthening their close cooperation on security issues. Both Japanese and South Korean leaders emphasized the importance of strengthening the close partnership between their countries, as well as between Japan and the United States, and the close cooperation of all three countries to deter and prevent the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons."On Thursday, Obama announced the engagement of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak on February 6, to attend the state dinner. The engagement was officially announced only a day after the dinner, which was attended on the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi and South Korean Vice President Oh Seung-Hui.Abe attended the state dinner with	0
For 460 days, they held her captive. They beat her, sexually assaulted her, kept her locked in a pitch-black room with chains around her ankles. And yet, Amanda Lindhout says she forgives her abductors.  YEAH? When I told her, she said, "I don't know what to do. I don't forgive them. I want to see my mom."  Well, OK, Amanda. So take off your pants and we'll see what you have to say. You know—in fact, you know everything, do you not? You were there the whole time. You were there when they locked her in the dark, remember? Well, I have no memory of it. You know it all. Now take off your panties. And we'll see what you have to say. You want to talk, say the word! Say the word!

He could still feel her on his chest. She took a deep breath. She slowly stood up, and, placing her hands on either side of her waist, held herself straight and tall. She stood up and walked to the sink. Her father followed, and she let him take hold of her hands."When we left, she was tied up. She was very weak. She had to hold to the wall for support." Amanda sat down and dried her hands on a towel. "She came out and said that they had to do what they came to do. They came in the room and I was sitting on the bed. I told her I wasn't going to make a noise. She stood in the middle of the bed, holding her wrists. She told me to look at her. She was very brave." Amanda took a sip of coffee. "I never saw her again. They left. They took me down to the basement.""What happened to her family?""Haven't the slightest idea. I got through to her family and I called the police, but they said that she didn't come home. She didn't call when she was supposed to. She didn't call when they were supposed to.

Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas. In Afghanistan, two rounds of "indirect fire" hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was hurt. The incidents highlight the security challenges with which both Iraq and Afghanistan are grappling. Both countries have had a heavy U.S. military presence until recently. The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the near-daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of American troops in Afghanistan. 18 dead in Christmas Day attacks near Iraq churches Iraq attacks In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas Day service, killing many. In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said. Altogether, at least 38 people were killed and some 70 others were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and wounded 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 wounded. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks -- in the Dora area of Baghdad -- targeting "Christians celebrating Christmas." "The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis.  The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism," according to a statement released by the embassy. Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year as tensions simmer between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the Shiites, who dominate the government. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes that many people in small religious minority communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the last decade and those that remain are "particularly vulnerable," facing "discrimination, marginalization, and neglect." Sectarian warfare, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, raged during the Iraq War. Half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is thought to have left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report. In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said.	1
Wang Yue, the two-year-old girl who was left for dead on a narrow street in southern China after a hit-and-run accident, has died. The toddler, nicknamed Yueyue, had been cared for in a hospital in Guangdong province  away where Wang’s parents had lived.The death of the child is the latest in a series of tragedies for child protection in Guangdong,  to the east of Hong Kong. Although the two-and-a-half-year old girl and her mother had been seriously injured in the accident, the family was unable to get any treatment for her until they arrived in Guangdong in April because of the lack of medical supplies and equipment.Earlier this year, Wang Yue died, making it the latest in a series of tragic accidents involving child protection in China’s southern province of Guangdong, where a new law has come into effect requiring children to be rescued from their parents if they are in immediate risk of death and have been neglected or harmed.The new law means that Guangdong parents must immediately report any incident where their children are suffering abuse or neglect. If they are unable to get medical treatment, they must be taken by ambulance to hospital. Those who attempt to abandon their children will face jail time and a fine.In April, a 10-year-old girl named Yuan Yingying was found dead inside a suitcase in a car at the entrance to a school in the southern city of Dongguan after she was taken by her mother to school on May 1.Dongguan police arrested the mother, who initially claimed Yuan had fallen ill at home. However, as the investigation of the case unfolded, it emerged that Yuan had been abused for several days before she was discovered dead.A few months ago, 12-year-old Yi He was found dead in a bag in his apartment in Sichuan,  south of Beijing, after he had gone out to play with some friends one afternoon. The report described him as being “very thin and unconscious.”After an autopsy revealed that the boy, who lived with his mother, had a serious abdominal wound, his parents were arrested, with the boy’s mother claiming he was sick. She was not charged with homicide.Such incidents have become almost routine in recent years following the country’s latest child protection	0

Students will make educated predictions about how many electoral votes each presidential candidate will capture in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Procedure Have students review the origin, purpose and function of the Electoral College. Ask students: What is the "winner take all" system? Are there any states that do not follow this system? If so, how do they determine their electoral vote allocation? How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidency? Next, divide students into small groups and assign each group a current swing state in the 2008 presidential race. Consult the CNN Electoral Map Calculator for a list of swing states. Then, refer groups to online resources, including CNN's Election Center 2008 on the CNN Politics site, to identify the following for their assigned swing state: After students complete their research, have each group analyze its data to determine which candidate it thinks will likely capture the swing state's electoral votes. Have each group present its prediction and the rationale behind it. Following the presentations, direct students to the CNN Electoral Map Calculator to log their predictions for all the U.S. states and calculate how many electoral votes they predict each presidential candidate will capture. Instruct students to create a chart and log their predictions for each U.S. state. After the election, compare students' predictions to the actual electoral vote outcome. Wrap up the activity by discussing the role of the Electoral College in determining the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. Correlated Standards Civics 9-12 Content Standards II.

It's thousands of square miles wide, virtually devoid of oxygen and it has been blamed for an increase in shark attacks: the Gulf of Mexico "Dead Zone" is getting bigger and forcing marine life -- including sharks - into shore. Signs warn the public in an area harboring high bacteria near a drain at Will Rogers State Beach, California. The zone has been caused by a flood of nutrients, such as agricultural fertilizers, which boost algae production in the sea. These growths consume huge amounts of oxygen creating a "marine desert" almost devoid of life. The "Dead Zone" varies in size each year, but in 1999 it was 7,728 square miles -- that's nearly the size of Delaware and Connecticut combined. The huge size of the "Dead Zone' is due to the increase in nutrient pollution flowing down rivers, including the Mississippi, which is estimated to have risen threefold in the last fifty years as chemicals become more and more common on farms. Environmentalists fear that the drive to radically increase the amount of corn-based biofuels produced in the U.S. from 15 billion gallons to 36 billion by 2022 could increase pollution in the Mississippi by 19 per cent. But the problem is by no means limited to U.S. waters. Similar "Dead Zones" are being discovered across the world and a major United Nations report in 2003 found that the number had doubled each decade since the 1960's. The UN report also warned that the number will continue to increase as intensive agriculture spreads around the world and that they are already having a significant impact on commercial fish stocks. All of this can come as quite a surprise. Growing water demands, more pollutants Think about pollution and you tend to imagine tall smoking chimneys or pipes pouring industrial effluent into our rivers and lakes. But the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly becoming a concern for environmentalists across the world. Agriculture, including livestock and poultry farming, can be a source of a wide range of pollutants that find their way into our water supplies through run-off and leaching. This happens when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the ground and it flows into watercourses and groundwater supplies taking dissolved pollutants with it. These can include sediment from eroded land, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds from chemical fertilizers and animal waste, which can also harbor disease pathogens.	1
E.L. James' ought to revise the title of her publishing juggernaut, 50 Shades of Grey, to 50 Shades of cold hard cash. After all, the author raked in an estimated $95 million this year, making her the world's top-earning author, according to Forbes.

In a close second place is James Patterson, earning $91 million, followed by Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins with $55 million, Bill O'Reilly with $28 million, and No. 5 is prolific romance author Danielle Steel with $26 million. Forbes culled these estimated numbers from sales data available from June 2012 to June 2013. Much lower on Forbes' list were No. 15 J.K. Rowling with earnings estimates of $13 million for her adult fiction releases The Casual Vacancy and The Cuckoo's Calling, and No. 16 George R.R. Martin with $12 million, though he was the best-selling paperback author of 2012.

England coach Fabio Capello has been forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup in South Africa. The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured With the list of 15 final squad members already set and the possibility of more names being added after England's 2-2 draw with Cameroon on Saturday, Capello has been forced to reconsider his initial choice. He had originally considered naming Fabien Barthez as captain and a replacement for Manchester United's John O'Shea. But with all the squad members fit, with the exception of goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who is in the middle of the recovery from an operation, Capello has been forced to revert to his initial plan and leave out the United striker.The issue is now that the squad is far from complete and there is no guarantee that any of the players would be available for the two friendlies against Costa Rica and the Republic of Ireland in June and July. Capello is also now unlikely to pick the players who will then be required to play in the European Championship qualifiers for the last 32 against Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro. As the favourites to go to the finals in Brazil, Capello felt that he had already selected the squad that could take them to the World Cup.But with the squad so altered, the prospect of picking another squad member might be considered and, in reality, may have to be considered. It would be the latest issue to emerge in the selection process for the World Cup, to which Capello has not been able to turn a blind eye, and now may have to be accepted as a fact of life. Capello's statement said: "It is clear, therefore, that we have to change the procedure. No one has to agree with the change but I can't just continue to be consistent and repeat again and again what I have said."Although it is thought that Capello's selection is not a simple one, he would still have to be convinced that his changes in the squad would not affect the fitness of his players for the crucial games against Costa Rica and the Republic of Ireland. He has previously said that he is happy to go back on his decision, provided he was clear that the changes would not affect the fitness of the players. England have been through similar selection dilemmas before in the past, most recently with the decision in 1999 to drop the famous Roy of	0
The death toll from a landslide that buried three villages in eastern Uganda stood at 18 Tuesday, and rescue officials fear the figure will rise. Another nine were   injured, about half in hospital, and more than 1,500 homes and structures were destroyed."We have never experienced a situation such as this in our two years here," said Bintu Kamukama, the local county commissioner.The disaster has left the villagers to battle torrential rains and mudslides that buried hundreds of head of livestock and destroyed hundreds of homes.The cause was not known, but the National Disaster Management Authority says the landslide was caused by heavy rains over a 24-hour period.Landslides are common in areas where deforestation and flooding make steep hillsides unstable and prone to slides.But for the residents of Lwengomera, only one house was left standing. And the bodies of two elderly men, who were killed by a landslide a week ago, were still in the rubble."I was busy outside when the landslide happened," said a man who identified himself as Okyejo, one of the victims."A large black cloud of dust blew over us and the house collapsed. The house has lost everything."'We will rebuild'The landslide came at the end of a week of torrential rain that caused flooding and landslides, in a region already hit hard by a drought, which destroyed crops and livestock."The houses collapsed, but we were fortunate," said Lekha, who was not identified for safety reasons. "We are trying to bring the dead back home.""Even though everything is destroyed, we will rebuild the whole village," said Okyejo. "God will be with us."Rescue workers said the bodies of two elderly people, who died a week ago in a landslide, were still buried among hundreds of dead livestock in the village of Mjala. About 500 cattle and 250 goats reportedly died.A local police investigator for the country's first independent prosecutor's office, the International Criminal Court, said Monday that he had sent a team to Uganda to investigate the deaths of the people killed in the landslide and another who died in an accident nearby."The people who have been killed were working in the fields, they were wearing protective masks and helmets. They were carrying loads," said the	0
Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler. The government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen Ã¢ÂÂat the height of its powerÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Â has announced that it will fire four top government staffers, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler, seen Ã¢ÂÂat the height of its powerÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Â according to the latest figures available. The firing comes on the heels of the resignation of Defense Secretary Gen Jose Lopez, a move he made after the U.S. began providing aid to Mexico and its armed forces, which were caught up in the anti-drug war. The firing of four senior government officials, at the height of its power, will leave thousands of federal civil servants Ã¢ÂÂ who will likely face layoffs Ã¢ÂÂ without jobs. The four officials will reportedly be replaced by interim aides. The Mexican government is reeling from a series of budget cuts. The three officials, along with Tellez Kuenzler, who will be leaving his post, are among the most unpopular officials in the last four years. Critics say they are responsible for the Ã¢ÂÂunprecedented debtÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that now stands at 18 percent of MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs GDP Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂand a series of social crises that were the result of their arrogance.Ã¢Â President Calderon also announced that his first appointee as vice president will be former Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who served as a chief of staff to former president Carlos Salinas. President Calderon, a Democrat, has said the economic crisis has forced him to reduce the size of MexicoÃ¢ÂÂs armed forces and to cut social spending. But the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs problems with the armed forces can be traced to the way that it was founded. MexicoÃ¢Â	0
Australian soprano Dame Joan Sutherland, dubbed "La Stupenda" by opera lovers, died Sunday at age 83 in her home in Switzerland after a long illness. In a career spanning the last half of the 1900s, Sutherland  performed as a soprano in over 150 operas. Sutherland was considered America's greatest soprano, and has been called "the voice of the New World." She also sang in English, Italian, German, and French. (Photo courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery)When her brother died, Dame Joan Sutherland asked the conductor and pianist of her church choir, Arthur Elton, if he would learn to become an opera singer. Elton became her accompanist and helped to develop her singing technique.(Photo courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery)Dame Joan Sutherland at age 7. At first, she was too small to sing in public. She was once called to come to the piano of a wealthy patron as a surprise for her birthday.(Photo courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery)Dame Joan, shown in her later years.On the night of December 16, 1949, Sutherland made history when she sang the part of Leonora in the world premiere of Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly at New York's Metropolitan Opera. Sutherland was only 21 years old. The role gave Sutherland the distinction of singing the world premiere of a work by one of the most important opera composers of the 20th century.(Photo courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery)Dame Joan and Giacomo Puccini shortly before Puccini's world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.Sutherland spent the majority of her life in Switzerland. She was a very private person, and rarely ever gave interviews or spoke publicly about her life. The public only knew about her for her work. Although Sutherland was not born in America, her fame as a vocalist was heavily influenced by early American exposure. She was awarded the title "The Voice of the New World" in 1959.Her career included performances of numerous operas, concert performances, and she also sang in many shows and concerts in Europe and the United States. In 1948, she recorded several live performances with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, including a recording of Beethoven's 9th symphony with the orchestra. She also performed with the	0
On the eve of the inauguration, President Barack Obama's second term may also be America's second chance. The country, in the last four years, has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation. It has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in Washington. The people have been divided -- by demographic shifts, cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. So, days before the president's second inaugural, the nation, too, is set to regroup. What it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make, experts say, will speak to the kind of America that emerges during the next four years. Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company "The enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago, it isn't completely gone but we have diminished our horizons," said Robert Schmuhl, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame. "We have learned that we are now living in an era of limits." Obama is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most. Hope and hurdles The 44th President was ushered into the Oval Office by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first African American elected to the lead the free world. But once in office, he found his efforts to right an economy hobbled by high unemployment -- 10% at its worse in 2009 -- and home foreclosure rates -- one in 29 homes were in foreclosure between 2007 and 2012 -- were limited by the magnitude of the problem and the political realities of a partisan Congress. His plan to reform the nation's healthcare system further expanded political divides in Washington and helped lead to huge losses among his party's moderates in the 2010 election. His re-election this fall — due in no small part to demographic shifts that included large numbers of minorities and women — was quickly followed by a protracted and deeply partisan showdown over trimming the nation's debt.

Mali's historic cultural center, Timbuktu, lacks electricity, water and phone service, because "terrorists" sabotaged the utilities there, a Paris-based spokesman for the ethnic Toureg separatist party MNLA said Thursday. MNLA spokesman Moussa Ag Assarid said most of the "terrorists" fled Timbuktu for the desert after French planes on Tuesday bombed the militants' headquarters, which was built by former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. However, Assarid warned, some militants remain in the fabled city. Assarid's choice of the word "terrorists" highlights the ever-shifting alliances as Mali devolves into a wild frontier. MNLA used to be aligned with Ansar Dine, one of the main Islamist groups fighting to take over Mali. But after MNLA ousted the Malian army from Timbuktu last year, Ansar Dine and al Qaeda drove MNLA away. The head of the United States' African Command, Gen. Carter Ham, spoke at Howard University in Washington on Thursday about the situation. He said his ultimate goal is helping a legitimate Malian government based in the capital of Bamako control the whole country. U.S. has flown seven cargo missions to Mali "Territorial integrity of Mali is nonnegotiable. No discussion of a separatist state or something like that. But, it also appears that Mali has asked for, and will need, some help to establish government control in the north," Ham said. "Realistically, we would all like to see the elimination of al Qaeda and others from northern Mali. Realistically, probably the best you can get is containment and disruption, so that al Qaeda is no longer able to control territory as they do today." "This must be in fact and in perception an African-led endeavor that is done at the request of the Malian government, and I think that is well under way now," Ham added. But recent allegations against Malian troops have some human rights observers questioning whether the Malian army has right on its side, or just might. Malian soldiers have carried out a number of summary executions as they seek to drive back Islamist militants who have been advancing from the north, a human rights group claimed Thursday. Mali's military offensive against the militants has gathered pace in the past two weeks, with backing from France and other international allies.	1
Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield, from which they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. Russia's Tupolev сontant bomber was one of three armed with weapons aimed at Venezuela that were sent by Russia after President Vladimir Putin warned the United States about plans to invade, the Associated Press reports. The planes will be refueled by civilian aircraft and return to Russia next week. The three warplanes landed late Tuesday at the international airport in Valencia, and Russian military personnel flew in to support the training, the ministry said. The aircraft departed a day later, on the fifth day of a six-week Russian military mission that began in late September with an aircraft carrier visit by the Russian navy.LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May said Thursday the U.K. must leave the European Union because the nation risks "betrayal" of its people on Brexit. "It's now or never," May told a Conservative Party meeting in central London. May's speech, her first as prime minister, showed her determined to make the case for staying in the EU, as she seeks to convince voters she is the best person to negotiate Britain's divorce settlement from the bloc.The White House is accusing President Donald Trump of making baseless accusations against the nation's top diplomat to the United Nations, saying the American's accusations are without merit and that the diplomat has done nothing wrong. Trump, in what has been described as his harshest attack on anyone in politics, tweeted Wednesday that U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley should "be ashamed of herself" for meeting with lawmakers opposed to the president's immigration policy. "Nothing would make me happier, but I thought she was wrong (wrong) onolitary," Trump tweeted. "She is quickly becoming more of a player, not a player," the president added, calling on Congress to take action against Haley's actions.The U.S. on Thursday called for an emergency meeting of Iran's Majlis to discuss its response to recent attacks on Saudi Arabia and other nations, an official said. Majlis is the lower house of Iranian parliament, and acts as an advisory body to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. U.S. envoy Wendy Sherman, in an emergency meeting with the senior leadership of Iran's parliament, called for an emergency meeting of the Majlis, an official said.

Lawmen subdued and disarmed a Seattle-area man suspected of writing an expletive-laden e-mail threatening President Barack Obama, a Secret Service agent says. Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit. Caluori is charged with making threats against the president and assaulting a federal officer, according to the affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Texas judge warns of civil war if Obama reelected Molnar wrote that the e-mail, received by the FBI earlier Tuesday, said, "I will kill the president !!!!!" and "You can't afford to call my bluff." The message said that dying "isn't frightening ... it's peaceful ... you will see..." and spoke of a "cop killing spree ... just over the hill," Molnar said. The e-mail included an address and challenged authorities to "come and get me." A database check confirmed that Caluori lived at the address in the e-mail," Molnar said in his affidavit, and the username of the e-mail account appeared consistent with his name. Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother. The officers knocked on the apartment door twice with no answer. The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said. "Caluori was wearing a black bandoleer filled with 12-gauge shotgun shells around his torso. Attached to the bandoleer at chest level was a large black fixed-blade knife. On his ankle, Caluori was weaving a revolver in an ankle holster. Caluori's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back," the affidavit said. The officers commanded the man several times to "show us your hands." At first he didn't comply. But then he "moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip," the affidavit said. After he raised the firearm, the officers scuffled with Caluori. By the numbers: Guns in America	1

It was the fifth time she has won the award.Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, at the 2015 Scripps Bee."I kind of feel like I already won something," she said.The Bee, the only national competition for students in fourth through 12th grades, offers winners one week to rest after competing and attend to their friends or family. Scripps held a teleconference with the judges Friday, and it was announced that she has won the Bee of the Plains in 2015, along with five other students.Kavya won the competition by spelling the word "pumpkin" correctly in 50 different words and adding an extra letter to some letters. She says she won because she was determined to spell all the words correctly."I started out by thinking about the spelling bee," she said.

Its official: Deep cuts in federal spending are under way, $85 billion over the next seven months. The question we should all be asking soon is: Where are the jobs? The reason given by Republicans and conservatives for the urgent need to  cut is that the US economy is faltering and unemployment will soon reach 8% in the US. They say this because the economy is strong in Europe and Japan, and will continue to grow in the US until the US economy grows strongly enough to create jobs.This analysis is flawed and it ignores the fact that the US economy is already strong. It is growing so very very strongly. In fact, it is growing at a rate of 10% a year. But Republicans and conservatives know that growth alone is not going to create jobs or solve America's job crisis. A rising tide does not lift all boats. That is why they have been trying to cut funding for research and development, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other key programs designed to improve US competitiveness. It is important to understand the truth about this because if we understand it, we will understand the reason for the urgency to create a jobs policy.The jobs problem goes back to the very beginning of the Obama administration. In 2009, the new Congress passed legislation that included almost $900 billion in tax cuts and spending reductions to stimulate the economy. Since then, the US jobs market has grown at an annual rate of 10%, twice the rate of Japan and nearly 5 times the rate of the US economy as a whole.The problem is not simply that more people are out of work. It is a problem of getting more people back to work. From 2002 to 2008, the Labor Department reported that the number of unemployed had dropped by 250,000, and the number of job openings was at its highest level in over 25 years. In 2007, the Labor Department added an additional 5.96 million employees, which is the largest number of employees added since 1948. The number of unemployed workers in every state and the District of Columbia has fallen continuously, by more than 10 million since the start of the recovery. This is not a matter of people just sitting around and being laid off. It is a matter of getting people who were employed in the past to re-enter the workforce.In fact, there are now so many people out of work that there are simply not enough qualified people left to fill all the jobs. According to the Bureau of	0
Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated specialists into their business. A Christie's employee stands beside a painting  at Christie's auction house in London on July 4. Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University. He later completed a degree at the Study Centre for Fine and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum. Not being of blue-blood birth, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting out as a porter in the furniture department. After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years. Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture. At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales. Finally in 1995, he decided he wanted to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors in the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people. Dolman was subsequently made Managing Director of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to enhance interest in high-quality art. Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as the Commercial Director to run Christie's Europe. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director. In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as the International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed an intensive five-year business plan, and Dolman took over from Christopher Davidge, as approved by Francois Pinault.	1
CNN readers had a mixture of admiration and disdain for "Bob," the anonymous U.S. programmer who outsourced his work to a Chinese firm for one-fifth of his paycheck. The incident was investigated by Verizon after a client company  reported a $1.5 million charge under his account, he was fired from his job at AOL, and he received a $3,200 settlement. Verizon and the programmer's lawyers both deny the allegations, and AOL has issued a statement saying it is "notifying all our consumers of this story" and that it "remains an active company and fully intends to continue to build its product."But in the eyes of many, this is not an isolated case. A recent article in Business Week said that many programmers "have become 'the black-market workers' of the information world. At least 1,000 programmers in the United States are known to work for companies that don't pay their salaries, and many more may work more than 200 hours a week without pay." In other words, it looks as though these aren't the idle hands of the unemployed, but a growing number of programmers who are being exploited by the growing number of web sites where programming is being offered for free. The Web is now home to thousands of free and very inexpensive resources for programmers: blogs and other online newsgroups, and information about software programming in general. They are the newest and least understood part of the information superhighway, and the rise in the number of this type of sites has coincided with the rise of the Internet in general.The free or cheaply priced programming resources on the Web have grown so common by now that there are even web sites devoted to tracking them. The programmer-tracking site WebCandy.org tracks the most popular programming sites and compiles a list every two weeks and lists the top sites in each category. The site features the following categories:General Interest Web PagesOpen Source SoftwareProgramming BooksFree SoftwareProgramming SoftwareWeb SoftwareThe Web pages on these lists, however, don't always represent actual programming resources, and the site itself describes its purpose as "a site for tracking the free web programming resources that are important in today's computer world, from blogs to free software, online computer magazines to free software and newsgroups."The rise of "free" programming resources, however, has left programmers like myself wondering  many questions,	0
The U.S. government claims he's the mastermind of a huge online fraud operation with multiple identities and a history of breaking the law and evading arrest, but his lawyer says he's a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand. The question is which of these descriptions of Kim Dotcom, the founder of the shuttered file-sharing website Megaupload, is closer to the truth? Arrested by the New Zealand police in a raid last week, Dotcom is one of seven people indicted by the U.S. on accusations of operating an "international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works." Megaupload's lawyers denied the charges, and online activists have rallied to the site's defense. The arrests and the shuttering of Megaupload prompted an angry reaction from the activist hacking collective Anonymous, which took credit for temporarily crippling the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI and entertainment company websites after the prosecution was announced. Dozens of supporters attended Dotcom's court hearings in New Zealand this week. As he sits in jail awaiting an extradition hearing in the coming months, attention has focused on the extravagant lifestyle he appears to have enjoyed. The U.S. authorities say Megaupload generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. The New Zealand news media appear fascinated by the new international celebrity, and the government is facing questions over why it granted him residency in the country despite his criminal record. Judge D.J. McNaughton denied Dotcom bail and offered insights into his different descriptions. Dotcom holds one German passport, under the name of Kim Schmitz, and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom. Prosecutors say the multiple passports, as well as bank accounts and credit cards from various countries linked to different names prove that Dotcom presented a flight risk. His lawyers have countered that Dotcom thought the Finnish passport under the name of Kim Tim Jim Vestor had been canceled, and that the reason he had 25 credit cards in his possession at the time of his arrest was that he is a "collector" of credit cards. Most of the cards had expired, according to the defense lawyers. He has prior convictions from 1998 related to computer hacking, from 2003 for insider trading in Germany and from 2011 for failure to disclose the number of shares he acquired in Hong Kong.	1
For years, Republican presidents and presidential candidates have strip-mined Clint Eastwood movies for rhetorical nuggets. Ronald Reagan warned Congress in 1985 that he had his veto pen at the ready if it voted a tax  increase, and he did. George W. Bush called for "reconstructing" the country's crumbling infrastructure by borrowing from its future. He was rebuked by his party's leadership; and his own economic record was found wanting.Donald Trump's recent comments about the Mexican government, as reported by CNN, reflect no such caution. He went to Mexico City in September 2015, for an ill-fated event to be held in El Paso, Texas; and he told the Mexican president he would be "100 percent behind" building a "great wall" along the southern U.S. border if he won the election. Trump's comments were greeted by a chorus of criticism from his Democratic opponents, who wondered why he was making such outlandish claims without providing any evidence. "I'm really not sure what he was thinking," said one senior Republican. The Trump campaign has not responded to calls for further explanation, and the president-elect has continued with other campaign appearances in Arizona and elsewhere without comment.To be fair to Trump, a man of blustery bravado and bombast, many of his campaign statements have been exaggerated and taken out of context. But his words and actions on the campaign trail this year carry a distinct whiff of cynicism and arrogance, and they do not inspire confidence that he will set aside his demagogic instincts or recognize the urgency of the issue at hand: the lack of action on the border. "A billionaire doesn't build walls," said Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. "And a billionaire doesn't have the political chops to get a president to do what needs to be done," she added, referring to a visit by the president to the border on February 01st, 2016.In a sense, Trump is right: a billionaire cannot build a wall. Not a Trumpian wall. And while Trump is certainly wealthy at his core, he is not, as Trump himself has been known to claim, the son of a billionaire. As a result, he can never claim to be the architect of the border problem. For Trump, however, the issue is not merely about a wall; it is about the right answer to America's dilemma in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond. For Trump, who	0
As its relationship with the West worsen, Russia is pivoting east in an attempt to secure business with China. Chinese premier Li Keqiang is  traveling to Russia this week as an official observer at a Shanghai-hosted BRICS summit. His visit comes against the backdrop of the two nations’ increasingly hostile relations, but it may also signal a new Russia-China dynamic. Here’s why.RUSSIA’S EAST ASIAN RIVALSIn January, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade war against China. The resulting tariffs on Chinese imports of the U.S. would be the largest ever imposed on the country. China responded with tariffs on U.S. imports of its products, retaliated with trade restrictions of its own — and then, weeks later, announced an official end to the trade war.Though Trump eventually relented, he made clear that the trade war wasn’t over: He told CNBC, “the other side will be fighting very hard.” Meanwhile, Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, stated, “If we don’t end this stupid trade war, China is going to end up being a net loser,” an outcome Trump has always expressed desire for.The president of the Russian Federation, however, has his own idea of how to win this particular trade war.In an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wants to expand Russia’s ties with the rest of Asia by inviting China to join Russia’s “new Silk Road” project that would span more than 2,200 miles and encompass Russia’s old rival, India. Putin said, “We have to look at many, many countries. But I think the time has come to join the Silk Road.”The Silk Road project would be an extension of Russia’s already significant ties with China, which date back to the Soviet era. In the late 1980s, Russia launched the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a project to enhance economic and diplomatic ties with Asia by investing in countries across the continent.The BRI project was initially intended to create a regional economic hub — a so-called “New Silk Road” — but has since expanded beyond the original plan and now seeks to connect Russia and China with	0
Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Fabio Coentrao from Benfica on Tuesday, with the Portugal international signing a six-year deal. The 23-year-old defender is the fifth new signing to arrive at the Bernabeu Â¡no after the departure of Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Sami Khedira.The Spaniard was brought on the same day as the transfer windows opening, while Khedira was in charge of the team in the transfer window. Coentrao will have an immediate chance to play against Barcelona at the Nou Camp as he will now be able to join the club’s squad during the summer holidays.Coentrao came through the ranks of Benfica’s youth system and is yet to taste first-team action. He has made only three appearances in the Portuguese top tier this season, with the other two coming as an unused substitute. The right-back made his Benfica debut in 2014 with the youth side.“I am very happy to join this fantastic club,” Coentrao told Soccernet. “There is a lot of pressure from the fans, which is exactly what I wanted and needed at this time of my life, and I feel that with this feeling we will have an incredibly successful year.”“Fabio will bring great quality to the Madrid team and we look forward to working closely with him.”With Khedira moving to the Nou Camp, Coentrao’s role on the team will be much more limited, and he will be expected to step into the role of a first-team regular after two seasons working for the reserve side.Madrid’s goal for the 2016-17 season is to avoid relegation, and the club has been working on ways to make life hard on the players that need to start the season out of the team.With Khedira having moved on, Coentrao will be given permission to play once the transfer windows close.He will be able to join the squad on the summer holidays once the transfer window opens. Coentrao will be the seventh new signing to arrive at the Bernabeu Â¡no after Ramos, Marcelo, Khedira, Ramos, Di María, Kiko Casilla and Khedira.	0
Less than three months ago, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down eagerly awaited rulings on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action. Next month, the court will begin its new term and likely deal with controversial ills like voter ID laws, hate crimes and the role of religious institutions in civil rights litigation.Some of these controversial issues and questions have already reached the Supreme Court and will be decided by the justices, but others are still pending, including several cases challenging the use of voter ID laws.The court is set to hear arguments in a case about the constitutionality of a Virginia law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. The high court is expected to decide on the legality of Indiana’s law that requires voters to show identification before they are allowed to cast a ballot. The Supreme Court will also be asked to decide whether states can require voters to show photo IDs in a number of other elections.Another issue the justices may have to consider are ballot measures. The court agreed in 2012 to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of Oregon’s 2011 voter ID law arguing that the law is an unconstitutional burden on voters’ right to vote. The case is now before the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court will hear oral arguments sometime this spring.In addition, there’s been a long-stalled Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of California’s requirement that voters show identification when going to the polls. A federal court ruled against California in 2014, but after the case settled and the court returned from the summer break, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to take the suit again in 2017.A number of other important cases in which the Supreme Court likely will be asked to hear the merits of cases are pending. A ruling on these cases could have a significant impact on a number of states’ voter ID laws that are now being challenged before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Voting laws in Arizona and Texas are currently before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, although one appeals court has already found that Arizona’s voter ID law doesn’t violate the Constitution. Another case challenging the constitutionality of Texas’ voter ID law is pending before the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.Another case challenging Texas’ voter ID law	0
Even though he was ill, Adam Scott could do little wrong in the early rounds at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He led by seven shots at the halfway mark at Bay ern Country Club, and finished second to Patrick Reed and Mike Weir.When he finished with a round of 66, Scott had the second-best score in the event.Scott is in a good place, with no major surgery planned in the near future, but it's hard to judge the situation before the surgery is performed.He will compete in the Masters next week at Bay ern Country Club. He has already won several tournaments in the area, including the 2010 Bay ern Country Club Championship; he won the same event in 2014 and 2015."I think the surgery is a good question mark - but we have talked about that this week. It would have to be good news to be able to move forward with it, and I think the good news is that he's doing well and has been training every day," said Scott's agent, John Bogle.A statement released by Bogle, who represents a number of golfers, said that Scott is "doing very well physically and mentally" and "is in the best shape of his life."It's that last point that is the biggest concern.Scott has not played any full swing practice in more than a month. He said he was feeling "sick as can be" in his last round of professional golf in June. He said he was not as strong during this first full week of full swing practice in July."I think he's getting very limited swings in, and this whole thing is a test of his stamina," said Bogle. "It's not what we expected when we signed him. It has been hard on him. He's done everything we've asked him to do."Scott said it has been hard to do his normal things because he is feeling so sick."I don't think he feels strong," said Scott. "He's got a lot of work to do, so I can't give him the kind of credit he deserves. It's just been hard to do what he does every day."Bogle said he did his best to try and help him by getting him into a gym."To his credit, Adam is on the right track," Bogle said. "He doesn't want	0
The public pay phone is an iconic landmark of some of the world's greatest cities. London has its unmistakeable red kiosks while the ersatz, plastic "telephone boxes" that line New York's streets can hardly be mistaken for anything but postcards. But for a few months in the second week of August in 1945, when London was invaded by the USSR, the public phone was a unique fixture of its bustling City-centre district."The public phone" was an invention of the early 1960s by the telecommunications and communications industry to provide a universal solution to the city's growing need for a single, reliable public phone network. The idea appealed to the British government, given the growing population and the city's increasing use of mobiles, since they would give residents the opportunity to communicate with each other wherever they might be without having to carry heavy and bulky pagers, but before public phone users were required to pay the exorbitant charge from the Post Office.The first public phone was installed in London's Whitechapel district on the corner of Duke's Lane and Great George Street in 1965. At the time, the area was known as one of London's "dangerous" areas, having witnessed both the notorious murder of Jack the Ripper and the brutal and shocking murder of Kitty Genovese.A decade later, London's public phone became Britain's first public service mobile network, when BT opened the first public phone network in the capital in the late 1970s.In the late 1960s, London's public phone network had fallen victim to the increasing use of private mobile phones, with some users having to use a two-way walkie-talkie while others were required to send a simple text message. The public phone was a useful way to bridge the digital divide, giving people a choice in which mode of communication to use when they wanted to call a member of the opposite sex. This meant that people could use it in the same way that they would use their mobile phone, making calls to their friends and family wherever they were in the capital.A public phone in central London.The most interesting thing about the public phone (other than the fact that it was the first in English-speaking countries on a public-right-of-way and hence could be seen from everywhere) was the fact that its user interface, the operator, could be configured from the handset in whatever way they	0
Two former top leaders in Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, which ruled the Southeast Asian country between 1975 and 1979, were found guilty of crimes against humanity by a specially-convened Cambodian court Thursday. Before the verdict, only one person had been brought to justice over one of the 20th century's great atrocities. Nuon Chea, the former Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, and Khieu Samphan, the one-time President of Democratic Kampuchea both received life sentences. Nuon Chea, 88, known as "Brother Number Two," and Khieu Samphan, 83, known as "Brother Number Four," were expressionless as the verdict was read. They were found guilty of the following: Crimes against humanity, of extermination, murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, forced disappearances and attacks against human dignity committed within the territory of Cambodia between 17 April 1975 and December 1977. "The chamber finds that as a consequence of the crimes of which the accused have been convicted, the civil parties and a very large number of additional victims have suffered immeasurable harm, including physical suffering, economic loss, loss of dignity, psychological trauma, and grief arising from the loss of family members and close relations," a judge said in the ruling. The men were taken into custody after their arrest in 2007. The defendants can appeal the judgment, and Victor Koppe, part of Nuon Chea's defense team, indicated that they would be seeking to exercise that right. The defense team for Khieu Samphan also said they would appeal the verdict. The charges were heard in Phnom Penh in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) -- a special United Nations-backed tribunal that was formed in 2006 to prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders and other regime figures responsible for especially heinous acts. Amnesty International welcomed the result as an important step towards justice. "This long-awaited ruling is an important step towards justice for the victims of the Khmer Rouge period and highlights the importance of addressing impunity," said the organization's Deputy Asia-Pacific Director Rupert Abbott. "But the earlier refusal of senior Cambodian government officials to give evidence, as well as allegations of political interference in other ECCC cases, is troubling and raises concerns around the fairness of the proceedings and respect for victims' right to hear the full truth regarding the alleged crimes."	1

The Tibetan government-in-exile has called on the international community to take action to halt violence in western China that has reportedly killed several Tibetans and left others wounded. "The Central Tibetan Administration urges the international community to not remain passive before the current situation," Lobsang Sangay, the head of the government-in-exile, said in a statement Tuesday. "It is high time for it to intervene to prevent further bloodshed." Clashes between Tibetan protesters and Chinese authorities occurred in recent days in Ganzi Prefecture, a mountainous area west of Sichuan Province. The unrest comes after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months and with the approach of the anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule, which has been a flash point in the past. The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, expressed concern about the situation. "We are seriously concerned by reports of violence continuing, heightened tensions in the Tibetan area of China, including reports that security forces in Sichuan Province have been opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring others," Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday. The Chinese government and international groups advocating Tibetan rights have offered differing versions of events this week in Ganzi, which Tibetans call Kardze. China has accused the rights groups of trying to "distort the truth" about the violence through "ill-intentioned hype." The first clashes took place Monday in Luhuo County, known as Drango by Tibetans. Citing witnesses, rights groups like Free Tibet and the International Campaign for Tibet say that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the unarmed crowd, killing two or three protesters and injuring dozens. The reports, which could not be independently verified, contrasted with the account given by the Chinese state news agency. A group of people, some with knives, damaged stores along a main street before throwing stones at the police and destroying two police vehicles and two ambulances, according to Xinhua news agency. The violence left one of the marchers dead and four wounded, as well as five police officers wounded, according to the news agency. It did not mention the use of guns by the authorities. Then on Tuesday, violence reportedly erupted in Seda County, which Tibetans call Serthar. Tibetan advocacy groups said that the Chinese security forces had shot dead between two and five protesters.	1
Hardly a day that goes by that you won't find Tracey Wygal working out at the gym. Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a "clean diet," keeping a food journal and exercising. The 30-year-old middle-school  teacher in New Haven, Conn., had heard of clean eating, but she said she had been "too busy" to do much research about it.On that February morning, when Tracey woke up after having dinner with a friend, she realized she had lost 30 pounds by using a food log to keep track of her meals. She began cutting out all the sweets she had previously enjoyed and the soda she had always enjoyed too.Tracey became so busy working out, cooking cleaner, and trying to keep a food diary that, at one point, she even stopped cooking one meal a day. The results were "incredible," she said. "I lost weight to the point that I was able to wear my wedding dress again."Tracey didn't know it at the time, but the clean diet she was following wasn't actually clean. It was designed only to make Tracey lose weight. But as Dr. Dean Ornish, a New York cardiologist who has devoted his life to studying how to lose weight, lost more than 300 pounds after cutting out sugar, she was ready to try it out.Like Tracey, Ornish, who has been known to eat nothing but water since he learned to eat again in 2004, was told about clean eating by his doctor. Ornish had just started to lose weight, and when he saw the doctors, he said he was told he "wasn't following a normal diet." Ornish said he felt so stigmatized that he decided to try a diet of water only to see how good his results were and whether he would feel stigmatized by following a diet of nothing but water. After a week of following the diet, Ornish saw results.And it's not just Ornish whose results have been dramatic. In a recent study of 12,000 people, overweight and obese, Ornish and his colleagues reported that those who followed a diet that consisted of "high-quality" foods containing only whole foods (including fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and grains) lost more weight than those who ate a diet high in refined foods, including sugar, and high in refined carbohydrates, even within a group of people who	0
There may still be doubts whether the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons against its own civilian population; but there is however conclusive evidence that it has effectively used the toxic stuff to poison the minds of western policy makers and paralyze  world public opinion, as the Syrian government has done with the use of chemical weapons against its people; and that the West must react with a strong political response even if it has to take a stand on this issue.The West has no choice but to act or it risks becoming part of the problem itself, as the West is becoming an enabler to the worst kind of repression and human rights violation. Many of those whose hands hold the leash are the West's core supporters and backers within the "rescue alliance" which, in its recent statement on the Syrian conflict, the White House gave a platform for to call on the world to "stand against the Assad regime.”If the U.S. is to remain a credible actor in the future, it cannot continue to become a protector of tyranny and the forces that seek to impose it. Instead it must be a force for the defense and freedom of mankind, and not simply a tool in the hands of a despot who despairs of the existence of humankind but who is confident that he can conquer it.As the White House statement said, and its website added:The international community must stand against the Assad regime. The regime’s use of chemical weapons—in its use of chlorine gas against civilians, its use of toxic agents such as sarin on innocent civilians, and its indiscriminate use of incendiary weapons—can never be justified.The White House’s statement was in its second paragraph and its statement on the “Syrian Human Rights Crisis” was in its first and third paragraphs.The second issue is that even if all the evidence is in the West knows that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons like the use of chlorine and chlorine dioxide was on August 21 2015. But that is not a reason or excuse for saying they are not chemical weapons and the use of them could be used legally. You have to be a very narrow and very cynical person to believe that this means that they have legal cover for using these chemical weapons. It means, that even if there is conclusive evidence that they have used chemical weapons against their own people, we’re not sure that’s legal.I have said	0
It's called Godwin's law.  The longer a debate rages, the greater the likelihood that someone will compare someone else to Hitler. And Hillary Clinton has done just that: On Tuesday the former secretary of state reportedly told a private fund-raising party that Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions are similar to Hitler's in the run up to World War II. Her quote (according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram): "All the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they're not being treated right. I must go and protect my people, and that's what's gotten everybody so nervous." Of course, what also gets everybody "so nervous" is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war. It's unlikely that Clinton intended to gain politically from these remarks -- and they were carefully qualified. She added that "there is no indication that Putin is as irrational" as the German dictator was. But they could indicate that if she wins the 2016 election, America might gain a slightly more forceful president in foreign affairs, someone more willing to engage directly in Europe than Obama has. You may recall that in the 2008 primaries she was the Democrats' hawk candidate -- so much so that Ann Coulter preferred her to John McCain (Coulter called her "our girl"). But was Clinton right? Mostly no. It is true that Putin's justification for intervention in Ukraine is similar to Hitler's, that is, threatening to invade a sovereign territory to defend his ethnic brethren. But the situation is complex, and the historical comparison is tenuous at best. Opinion: Has Putin broken international law? After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists -- not Putin -- who are the Nazis. The Russians have asserted, quite accurately, that the revolution that overthrew a pro-Russian, democratically elected leader has resulted in the elevation of Russophobe fascists into key government positions. For example, the new secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council is Andriy Parubiy -- co-founder of the Neo-Nazi Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU).	1
Veteran striker Raul Gonzalez scored his 71st Champions League goal to help Schalke beat holders Inter Milan 2-1 on the night and 7-3 on aggregate to reach the semifinals of the competition on Wednesday. Already in the driving seat after their stunning 5-2 first leg win at the San Siro, the German Bundesliga side never looked likely to relinquish their advantage and eased through to the last four, where they will now face Manchester United. Raul opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time, controlling an inch-perfect pass from compatriot Jose Manuel Jurado, before rounding goalkeeper Julio Cesar to slip the ball home. However, the Italian side levelled the scores just four minutes later when Thiago Motta was left unmarked from a corner to head home. Benedikt Hoewedes then had a header ruled out for offside, but the Schalke defender was not to be denied and he hit the winner with nine minutes remaining, firing home after latching onto Raul's pass. Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick told reporters: "We have produced two great performances against Inter. "If you only allow the Champions League winners a couple of chances, you know you have played well. "Each player worked hard for each other and that was the key to our success," he added. Schalke will host United in Gelsenkirchen on April 26 in the first leg, with the return at Old Trafford on May 4.	1
Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is investigating a report that workers at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were told to use icky chemicals, in a potential violation of the Japanese Occupation Safety and Health Act and company policy.But that's not the only violation. According to a Japanese broadcaster, an internal company memo to an unidentified contractor contains a number of "illegal" actions, including "taking bribes from the contractors."Workers at the plant were reportedly told to use icky chemicals like arsenic-contaminated water to sanitize the power plant. They also reportedly told them to wear helmets and rubber suits. According to the broadcaster, the contractor was sent a memo with instructions on how to "conduct the disinfection" and "ensure worker safety." The letter allegedly advised the contractor to use "aromatic chemicals...at the expense of the workers."The memo was sent just after workers at the plant detected radioactive contamination in the waters that have since migrated into the ocean and were collected for decontamination. The broadcaster has made it clear that its source is not the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, but a group of Fukushima workers "with a different source."The document was reportedly sent to "a contractor." Japan now plans to carry out investigations "to determine the origin of the document." The broadcaster reports that the document was sent "from a contractor of one of the major construction companies in Fukushima...to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on Monday."The broadcaster has made its source clear: "The document was sent from a contractor of a major construction company in Fukushima Prefecture, Nihon Jiroku Kogyo Co. Ltd. to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on Monday." Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare also confirmed with ABC News that "the document was sent by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on behalf of its internal investigations."The Ministry's confirmation is a sharp reversal from just a few days ago, when the broadcaster said it's "believed" the document is from the Ministry of Health. "We have no choice but to follow up the matter further," a Health Ministry representative told ABC News.It's unclear who wrote the memo, but a number of Fukushima workers have claimed that workers at the plant told them to use the chemicals in question. "All of them, including the contractors, are working in the same	0
Oregon authorities have arrested a man accused of killing his girlfriend in Washington state and posting gruesome pictures of her body online. David Michael Kalac, 33, was taken into custody near Portland late Wednesday by the Wilsonville Police Department. He was wanted on suspicion of second-degree murder. "Outside of a terrorist attack this is as serious as you can get," said Deputy Scott Wilson of the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department. Authorities first received a call Tuesday afternoon. When they arrived at the apartment in Port Orchard, Washington, they found the body of Amber Lynn Coplin, 30. Around the same time, authorities started receiving tips about suspicious photographs posted online on social media sites Imgur and 4chan. "The initial poster, believed to be Kalac, was also posting comments with the pictures. He said that the crime scene would be discovered and what he was going to do. We took this very seriously. We have no reason to believe that anyone posted them but him," the deputy said. According to CNN affiliate KOMO, the statement read, in part: "Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the (expletive) news. I have to lose my phone now." KOMO reported the same writer later added: "Turns out its way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks on the movies. She fought so Damn hard." Kalac has a history of domestic violence and making threats to law enforcement, Wilson said. The victim's missing vehicle was found abandoned in Portland earlier in the day. CNN's Tony Marco, Tina Burnside, Dave Alsup and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.	1
Edgar and Nina Otto say they had no idea how their four-legged clone would react to them. But last week, after waiting several months, the yellow Labrador puppy bounded off an airplane at Miami International Airport, right into their arms. Lancelot Encore is his name, or Lancy for short. Nina and Edgar Otto say their cloned puppy crosses his paws like the original dog did. The puppy Lancy looks and acts just like Lancelot, their first Lab, who died a year ago, say the Ottos. That's not surprising, because Lancy is Lancelot's clone. "We just got him because we wanted to have Lancelot more than just the 11½ years," Nina Otto said. The Ottos submitted the winning bid of $155,000 at an auction with a San Francisco biotech company that had Lancelot cloned in South Korea.  Watch Lancy at home with the Ottos » "Did I ever think that I was going to spend $150K on a dog? No," Edgar Otto said, adding, "This is a really sweet dog, and ... we're very happy that we did it." Edgar Otto is the son of Edward Otto, a co-founder of NASCAR. So money was really not an issue for this family. They got the idea five years ago and had a sample of Lancelot's DNA extracted and banked when they heard that cloning was possible. So far, the Ottos say Lancy is eerily similar to Lancelot. They say Lancy walks just like Lancelot and crosses his paws like him, too. "I only was hoping to get the essence of Lancelot back," Nina said. "I know I've gotten that. Anything else is icing on the cake." But is it the same dog? "It's as close as you can get," Edgar said. The Ottos have nine other dogs, as well as cats, birds and sheep, all living on a spectacular 12-acre spread in Boca Raton, Florida. "This dog was immediately accepted by the nine dogs," Edgar Otto said. "There was no baring of teeth, not ever a single growl. So, the pack accepted him." Four customers who also placed winning bids in an auction by BioArts International will have their dogs cloned, and those pets will be delivered in the coming months.	1
President Malam Bacai Sanha of Guinea-Bissau died early Monday, according to an official at the West African nation's embassy in Paris. He was 64. The official said Sanha was in Paris for treatment, and died at Val-de-Grace Hospital. Sanha became president in September 2009, months after the assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Sanha had served as interim president and defeated another former president, Kumba Yala, in a runoff election. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.5 million gained independence from Portugal in 1974. Those conflicts ravaged the nation's infrastructure and economy and left it among the poorest in the world. Despite Sanha's coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. Last month, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the use of violence in what was suspected to be a military coup attempt, saying in a statement, "The primacy of the lawful civilian authorities according to the constitution must be respected." And, despite the Parliament's call to fight drug trafficking, Guinea-Bissau is still considered an increasingly important transit point for cocaine en route from South America to Europe, according to the CIA Factbook.	1
A new document by Iran's supreme leader calling for the elimination of Israel shows that world powers must not rush into a deal on the country's nuclear program despite an upcoming deadline, Israel's Prime Minister said Monday. "There is no moderation in Iran. It is unrepentant, unreformed, it calls for Israel's eradication, it promotes international terrorism," Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. "This terrorist regime in Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear threshold power. And I call on the P5+1 countries -- don't rush into a deal that would let Iran rush to the bomb." (The P5+1 refers to the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany.) Iran insists it only wants nuclear energy.  And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while calling for the elimination of Israel, said he opposes "a massacre of the Jewish people in this region." Instead, he seeks a referendum. But in the meantime, "armed resistance is the cure," he says, calling for the West Bank to be "armed like Gaza." The call reflects internal Palestinian politics as well. Iran supports Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Hamas' rival faction, Fatah, controls the West Bank. On Sunday, the government in the West Bank accused Hamas of bombing its leaders' homes. Israelis were stabbed in two "terrorist" incidents Monday, leaving one woman dead, police said. Annihilation call made through Twitter The Iranian leader made his call for Israel to be "annihilated" on Twitter over the weekend. Mixed in with tweets insisting that Iran is committed to diplomacy on other issues, Khamenei posted a series of tweets slamming Israel.  Among them was a document called "9 key questions about elimination of Israel." While he and other Iranian leaders have spoken similarly of Israel in the past, the one-page document, packed with specific details, was new. It says the "proper way of eliminating Israel" is for "all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum." The "Jewish immigrants who have been persuaded into emigration to Palestine do not have the right to take part," he adds.	1

While Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed more evidence of his importance to Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday, Barcelona responded with an ominous warning of the club's powers even without Lionel Messi. With the four-time world player of the year battling to be fit for Wednesday's visit by the French league leaders, having injured his hamstring in last week's 2-2 draw, Cesc Fabregas put up his hand for a role in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal. In a Messi-esque performance, the Spain midfielder took his chance to impress as he scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona in a 5-0 thrashing of Mallorca that kept the Catalan side 13 points clear of second-placed Real Madrid in La Liga. Alexis Sanchez, another midfielder who has struggled to consistently impress since his 2011 arrival at the Camp Nou, chimed in with the other two goals. The match was also notable for the second-half introduction of French defender Eric Adibal, making his first senior appearance since his liver transplant last April. By that stage Tito Vilanova's side, much-changed from the trip to Paris, were already five goals ahead as both Fabregas and Sanchez netted twice in the opening period, toying with the visiting defense. Fabregas was taken off as a precaution after completing his treble with an assist from Andres Iniesta, but Sanchez hobbled off late with an injury that casts doubt on his fitness for the PSG clash. Barca hope to have Messi back for that match, as his injury is not as bad as feared. The Argentine netted the opening goal of the first leg, his 57th this season, but it was Ibrahimovic who had the last word as he set up a late equalizer. The Sweden forward, who was able to play -- and also score -- last week after having his European suspension halved, has now netted 26 league goals this season following another opportunistic effort in Saturday's 2-0 win at Rennes. Ibrahimovic finished off from close range in time added on after halftime substitute David Beckham chipped the keeper, denying the veteran Englishman his first goal since signing in January. Jeremy Menez had earlier scored a fine individual goal as Qatar-funded PSG moved seven points clear at the top of the table after the club's first win at Rennes since 2002.	1
Academy-Award winning actress Patricia Neal, whose off-screen life was one of dramatic triumph over adversity, died Sunday at her home in Edgartown, Massachusetts. She  was 92.After a long string of career achievements - the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the 1969 film, "The Best Years of Our Lives," and her two-time Emmy Award for "All in the Family" and for the television drama "The White Shadow" - Neal achieved what was probably her most lasting achievement - her Oscar nom for Best Actress in 1970 for "The Caine Mutiny."Her final film performance - in the 1985 drama, "The Last Detail," - garnered her a nomination for Best Actress.Born May 6, 1929 to Elmer and Lottie Neal in Chicago, Illinois, Neal was a child of show business. Her father, Elmer, was a famous vaudeville singer who opened his own theater in Chicago. Neal was a teenager when she started her acting career on the Chicago stage.

The virtual cathedral for one of America's most revered cars will reluctantly fill a monster sinkhole that brought it both pain and gain. The National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, also said Saturday it and Chevrolet will restore three of the eight vehicles that the 45-foot-wide hole swallowed in February, but will leave the remains of the five others -- too wrecked to fix -- on display. "We really wanted to preserve a portion of the hole so that guests for years to come could see a little bit of what it was like, but after receiving more detailed pricing, the costs outweighs the benefit," museum Executive Director Wendell Strode said. Why was the hole's filling ever in doubt? Visitor traffic since February jumped 70% compared to the same period last year, as people lined up to see not only the brand's past but also the newly mangled vehicles and gaping earth, museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli said. But the board learned that preserving part of the hole would cost $1 million more than it would to fill the whole thing. And the effort required to keep it safe -- eyesores like 35-foot retaining walls and steel beams -- made preservation even less appealing, Frassinelli said. "That's no longer a naturally occurring, interesting sinkhole," she said. Frassinelli said the museum isn't revealing how much the renovation will cost. The project will start sometime after early November. The privately funded, not-for-profit attraction has gone from shock to proudly displaying its own spectacular damage in months. The ground opened at the museum's Skydome section in the early morning of February 12. Surveillance video showed the hole devouring some of the eight cars that it took down. The hole was measured at about 45 feet wide, 60 feet long and up to 30 feet deep. Western Kentucky is cave country, and it turned out a previously undetected cave was under the Skydome, Frassinelli said. Sinkholes pop up regularly in the area, sometimes caused by ground water eroding underground limestone over many years. After experts examined the cave and determined the rest of the facility was safe, the museum reopened -- and started letting visitors view the sinkhole behind plexiglass five days after the incident.	1
Americans don't usually pay a lot of attention to Spanish politics, but the election of 2004 proved an exception. The election that occurred Sunday should be a second. The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war. Sunday's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war. The conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Aznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel. Yet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all. I made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005. How? Now we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy. Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002. Signing up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain.	1
Two men went on trial Friday accused of the "cowardly and callous murder" of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in a London street. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are each accused of murder, conspiracy to murder a police officer and attempted murder of a police officer. They denied the charges at the Old Bailey court in London. Prosecutor Richard Whittam told the jury that the suspects deliberately attacked an unarmed man from behind using a vehicle as a weapon, "and then they murdered him and mutilated his body with a meat cleaver and knives." The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera. "The only reason we've killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers," he said. "This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth." "You people will never be safe. Remove your governments -- they don't care about you," he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron. "So get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so you can all live in peace. Leave our lands and you will live in peace." The killing of Rigby outside the Woolwich Barracks in southeast London on May 22 shocked the nation. He left behind a wife and a young son. Two men plead not guilty to murder of British soldier Almost decapitated Describing the events of that day, the prosecutor said the two suspects drove at Rigby in a car traveling at 30 to 40 miles per hour. The soldier appears to have been knocked unconscious by the impact, he said. The court was shown surveillance video of the car crossing to the wrong side of the road before it hit him, and Rigby rolling onto the hood of the car. He was carried on to the sidewalk. Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road. Cars driven by passersby stopped at the scene, some with their warning lights flashing. Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car.	1
Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice, according to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney: Need to hold pirates off Africa's east coast accountable. Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. "The problem is there's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [to hold them] accountable and try them for their actions, there's no way to -- to finish the problem," Gortney said. The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month. He said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official. In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa. As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney. "That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after," Gortney said. The United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia. There are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » Pirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country.	1
The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The official, who would not speak on the record because it is an ongoing case, said investigators have determined that the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and that a fuel drum was missing from the airport from which Andrew Joseph "Joe" Stack III took off Thursday morning. "I think there is a good chance he might have put it on his plane," said the official, who cautioned that investigators were still working that lead and sifting through the crash site. The single-engine plane has a fuel tank capacity of 38 gallons and is equipped with four seats, according to the Web site risingup.com. The FBI said Friday it has taken the lead role in the investigation of Thursday's crash into the 7-story building in northwest Austin that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. "You're talking about a federal agency that was basically assaulted," Ralph Diaz, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio, Texas, field office, told reporters. Two people were killed and two others were hospitalized, federal officials said. Though the remains found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, Diaz said Friday. "One may be Mr. Stack and our fear is certainly the other would be either someone who was visiting or someone who was employed in the building," he said. Emergency services chief Ernie Rodriguez said one of the injured was treated and released; the other remained hospitalized. City of Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr credited the building's fire protection, fast work by the Fire Department and the fact that the employees had practiced exiting the building in case of an emergency for the low loss of life and injuries. "It truly worked," she said. Austin attack stuns community Rodriguez said units arrived on the scene within five minutes of the first 911 call prepared to manage hundreds of injured people. "We found only two persons," he said. "When you look at the fire, when you look at the evidence, it's hard to say that we were lucky, but we were," he said. "The big thing to remember is that yesterday, in the midst of this event, God's grace was upon us."	1
Swimmer Michael Phelps, the most-decorated Olympian of all time, tweeted Sunday that he is taking a break from the sport "to attend a program that will provide  a different perspective on the human spirit."He's right. When people talk about his career, they always talk about his successes, his world records, his feats of strength, his athleticism. But what they rarely mention is his humanizing of everyone, his ability to bring out the best in athletes, the people who work with him and cheer for him week after week, year after year.For example, when Phelps and his father, Larry, first met in 1993, their paths would not have crossed in many ways. Larry, then known as "Larry the Cable Guy," was a former high school basketball coach trying to turn around his community. He had coached the likes of Dikembe Mutombo and Dominique Wilkins, just to name a couple. Then came his son, who had yet to make the leap from a basketball game to the track, and he was there for him through every step of his professional journey, from the Olympic trials, to the U.S. Olympic team and then to the world stage, where he became a household name."My father and I hit it off and we really got to know each other," Phelps recalled. "He was a huge inspiration and really a great mentor."This week was the first time Larry and his son have met face to face, and while it was emotional, both Larry and Larry the Cable Guy were thrilled to see that their relationship had endured despite the differences in their lives."He is a very positive man," said Larry the Cable Guy. "My greatest concern is that his life doesn't take him away from what he loves the most, his family."I know one thing that gives me courage every day. And that is when my son is out in nature, there's nothing that can get in his way. He is the only person on the planet that can do what he's done. He is blessed with great luck. My greatest concern is that he keeps his life simple, keeps his faith and keeps his family in his life. This time he is going away on a boat trip that will give him a different perspective on the human spirit.""When I see my kids out in nature there is nothing that can get in their way," said Phelps	0
Jerome Kerviel, the man behind France's biggest rogue-trading scandal, lost his appeal Wednesday against his prison sentence for betting â‚¬50 billion (about $65 billion) of a French bank's money without its Â­knowledge.The appeals court upheld his two-year prison sentence, as well as being banned from taking over a French bank for one year. He became the first person sentenced to jail under France's new anti-money laundering legislation.In his appeal Kerviel argued that he was merely trying to make a fast buck through a "no-risk" scheme. He said he didn't realize that the bank he was taking money from, BNP Paribas Bank, had little to no exposure to terrorism.But Justice Minister Alain Juppe said the prosecution had no choice but to prosecute, because there Â­was no other way to get the accused to stop defrauding French citizens.A French magistrate sentenced Kerviel on March 12, 2008 to two years in jail.Although he wasn't charged under the anti-money laundering law, his conviction is a huge slap in the face to France. It is the first time in many years that a white collar criminal has been convicted under a new law, which critics say allows authoritiesâ??to be harsher in investigating and prosecuting financial crimes.However, this case, as well as the fact that the charges against Kerviel are the first ever to be brought under the new law, are cause for hope.In an interview with ABC7 the morning after the verdict, Kerviel maintained that BNP Paribas should have been far enough away from terrorism that it shouldn't have been in the business of laundering money."I am not guilty of being involved in money laundering, but the money laundering itself is a violation of the law," he said.He said he didn't know that the BNP Paribas bank had no terrorism exposure when he took the money from it. He said he only realized that in 2010 when he was under investigation by French financial police.If, like Kerviel, you are doing something you're not supposed to, it becomes illegal. That's what the law says.What do you think? Is he right?The man who started it all by creating the largest bank fraud ever seen in a	0
With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an "always-on" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar. The details come a week before the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) next week in Los Angeles and, presumably, are meant to free up the company to focus on games and features, not consumer concerns, during its major showcase there. Among the new details: Up to 10 family members will be able to log in and play purchased Xbox One games from anywhere. The unique proposition addresses concerns from fans about being able to play where they want, and when they want, in an era when game companies worry about protecting digital rights. The games also will be playable by anyone who uses the console at the buyer's house. But what about used games? One blog post emphasizes there will be no fee for transferring or selling games back for cash and credit on Microsoft's part. However, the wording suggests that restrictions could come from game publishers themselves. "Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers," the post reads. "Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games." Microsoft uses the same "game publisher can enable" language when talking about trading or giving games to your friends. There are two requirements on trading from Microsoft: the recipient must be on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given away once. What will game publishers do with this new control over used games and trading? And how will retailers, who rely on game trades as part of their business, react? That remains to be seen. In releasing the new details, Microsoft seeks to take the spotlight off of itself and aim it at third-party publishers. At the end of the day, it's those publishers who have the most to lose if games on new consoles like the Xbox One, and Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4, don't have built-in protections that keep them from being resold or shared. But digital-rights management and other protections are unpopular with many gamers, who argue they should be able to do what they like with a game once they've paid for it.	1
There are no easy answers when journalists have to decide how to cover a terrorist group's video. The issue resurfaced Tuesday when a member of the Islamic extremist group ISIS was shown on camera beheading American journalist _____ and placing a message of "God is great" across his body.___CNN's Tom Foreman contributed to this story.Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.The story of Islam's history in India and the impact it has had on other cultures is a complicated one. The number of people who identify themselves as practicing Muslims in India is a mere fraction of the actual population. The number of Muslims is said to be over two billion, or about 1.35 percent of the global population. India is home to the largest Muslim population in the world.A number of Muslim scholars agree that Islam does not tolerate religious bigotry and therefore prohibits people from converting from one religion to another.Religious differences have given Islam its unique identity as the dominant religion of Muslim countries in the world.Religion provides an important dimension of Indian life that has been the focus of much discussion since the country achieved independent statehood in 1947.The religious divide has led to two major controversies in India. One in which Muslim-Christian communal tensions escalated into violence in 1984, and the other in which Hindu extremists attacked Muslims in the aftermath of the 2002 Mecca bombings and the 2005 Mumbai attacks.As India, its neighbours and Muslim countries grapple with these issues, the nation's Muslims are also trying to understand why their religion and culture are being challenged by others. In an attempt to find common ground, a number of Muslim leaders have come together in a national dialogue to understand and promote their shared religious and cultural heritage.The National Dialogue on Islam, or NDUI, held in Delhi in January aims to promote understanding, discuss common problems and promote education.Ahead of the NDUI, I spent some time with some of the Muslim leaders in Delhi who are part of the dialogue project. The conference was aimed at increasing the Muslim population in India to about 2.4 million by 2025.The Muslim population in India is divided into two main groups: the country's native Indians who practice Islam and the large Indian Muslim population who are not from India, including Pakistan, and who practice Islam as well.

Sebastian Pinera was sworn in Thursday as president of Chile, taking over a country battered by a recent earthquake but with a strong economy and stable social institutions. ÂPinera, 39, is a former union leader and politician who has been a prominent voice for change in Chileâ€™s long-running political upheaval.â€œThe day to day activity, as well as that of the citizens, will be guided by the people,â€ Pinera said after a short inauguration ceremony.Pinera was chosen to lead the most politically unstable nation in the Americas by the leftist party of socialist President Michelle Bachelet. Bachelet, the worldâ€™s oldest first lady, also named Pinera, a fellow member of her socialist party, to serve as finance minister for the new government.The presidential election was scheduled for October 27, the same day that Bachelet made her second bid for re-election.President-elect Pinera, a former union leader, will be sworn in on Thursday.Earlier this month, Chileâ€™s central bank announced it will cut its deposit rate to 2 percent for the first time since the countryâ€™s debt crisis began in the beginning of the decade. The change follows the bankâ€™s promise to increase it to 4 percent by December 2014.The central bankâ€™s announcement came after the government announced a $6.6 billion (Â£4.3 billion) plan to cut a $12-billion (Â£7.4 billion) budget deficit in the year ending in June.In a bid to reverse a collapse in the economy, the government has proposed tax cuts and cuts to spending, such as pensions and public health care.Bachelet has pledged to run as a presidential candidate in October, after winning the second of her three mandates in the general election in March.The new president has some challenges ahead, including the continuing crisis in the countryâ€™s troubled banks, the ongoing political upheaval and the possibility of a change in Chileâ€™s constitution.He will also have to deal with a new coalition government in which the center-right parties of Chileâ€™s new President Sebastian Pinera has been in conflict with the socialist party of Michelle Bachelet.Under	0
I'd already run about half the marathon when the next refreshment table came into view. Thirsty and needing to stay charged for the next 13 miles, I elbowed my way through the crowds of runners and grabbed my drink of choice. A nice glass of full-bodied red wine. This is how it rolls at the Marathon du Medoc, an annual festival of wine and running near Bordeaux, France, in which competitors strive to complete 26 miles and almost as many glasses of the local vin. Now in its 30th edition, the race is something of a legend for marathon runners. Last year I was among 3,300 runners from 53 different nations -- Japan, Canada, Australia -- joining 5,200 competitors from across France. Sure, there are prestige races in London, New York, and Chicago, but the gustatory element is lacking. Even the Paris marathon fails to offer much more than bananas and water. Instead, this marathon weaves through scenic vineyards in the Medoc region, starting in the town of Paulliac, where some of the best Bordeaux wines are produced. The run has a time limit of six hours and 30 minutes and is nicknamed "the longest marathon in the world" with little exaggeration. In 2013, only about 1,100 runners finished under four hours and thirty minutes -- the other 7,400 were in no rush, if they finished at all. Hairy body suits To compare, the 2013 Paris marathon had an average speed of four hours and 10 minutes. As if it's not enough that we're all drinking, the marathon is themed each year, with nearly every participant dressed in costumes. Last year's theme, "sci-fi," saw runners dressed as aliens, "Avatar" characters and a few daring Chewbaccas in full hairy body suits. For this year's race on September 13, 2014, 10,000 competitors are expected to dress to the theme of "Carnival around the world." Increasingly popular, places are hard to come by and many entrants race it competitively to win prizes of -- yep -- wine. While the Medoc hasn't resorted to operating the lottery entry systems recently adopted by the Chicago and Paris marathons, competitors now face an online scramble to sign up during several registration waves scheduled by organizers. With more runners than ever expected, locals in Paulliac are getting ready for the 2014 event.	1
One of al Qaeda's most influential figures in North Africa has been killed by French and Chadian forces, a U.S. official said Friday. French military sources had earlier said that Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, a deputy leader  who was described by U.S. officials as a senior al Qaeda operative, had been killed in what was the most significant military defeat for the terrorist group in its history.  Abou Zeid was one of at least seven senior leaders within al Qaeda's Libyan branch who were killed in attacks earlier this month, U.S. officials said. Two weeks ago, a French military spokesman said that Abou Zeid and three of the other senior leaders were believed killed when their vehicle came under fire in the Al-Ubeidi area of Chad.The other three leaders are Abu al-Fadl and Ali Suleiman, both described as  former fighters for the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, the senior al Qaeda affiliate in Libya.  Abou Zeid had been listed as one of at least three top al Qaeda officials killed or injured in recent weeks. Abu al-Fadl, believed to be responsible for the death of the U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl in 1996, is also believed to have died. An al Qaeda spokesperson said Friday that Abu al-Fadl died of wounds suffered the day before, in what is considered a "horrifying  incident."  Abou Zeid, a graduate of Cairo University whose family moved to Chadian territory as early as 1994, was regarded by U.S. counterterrorism officials as the most influential figure of al Qaeda's most active branch in North Africa. They described him as "one of the great brains" behind al Qaeda's recent operations, which have targeted U.S. troops, U.S aircraft, and international shipping.  Some of Abou Zeid's operations were conducted from bases in neighboring Algeria, where he was in command of a large al Qaeda unit that was responsible for carrying out the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Others were conducted from bases in Libya, where he was in charge of the U.S.-designated "operations center."As the U.S. and its allies have tried to recover from the September 11 attacks, a number of al Qaeda's most prominent leaders have been killed or injured since then.	0
Last week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas officially submitted the statehood request asking that the United Nations recognize "Palestine" as an independent state. But while Abbas's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at  Palestinian flags were being unfurled on the UN General Assembly that voted down the Palestinian statehood bid by a clear margin, and with overwhelming disapproval by the nations who voted against the Palestinian move.While the United States, Israel, and other nations strongly condemned the Palestinian move, this defeat in the UN General Assembly represented a setback for the Palestinian demand for statehood. One might say the rejection by the UN of the Palestinian statehood bid was a form of "victory" for Abbas, even if the UN voted to reject the Palestinian statehood proposal that was being put forth by his government.To Palestinians, this was just another point in their political journey.The Palestinian struggle for statehood had been going on for over fifty years, as Israeli oppression and the lack of peace along the borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, was one of the driving forces for the Palestinians to seek statehood.For those who are unfamiliar with the Palestinian struggle for statehood, to understand the Palestinian call for statehood, it is necessary to have some understanding of its history and background.The Palestinian struggle for statehood began in the late 1950s over a plan by the newly founded Palestinian Arab state, to incorporate the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The idea was to split the Palestinian population into two parts, Arabs and Jews, allowing for the creation of a Palestinian state that would be divided along religious lines. Palestinians were adamant that the West Bank and East Jerusalem should remain independent and not become part of a single nation.The 1967 war between Israel and Arab countries, which Israel had invaded and occupied, led to the Palestinian call for a state of their own. In the wake of that war, the Arab League responded to the Palestinian call by declaring war on Israel.In the wake of the war, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, made a speech on the Arab League's first anniversary of the war. He described the West Bank and East Jerusalem as the independent capital of a Palestinian state, which represented "an independent and sovereign state." Arafat went on to call for "the return to all of Palestine of its past, its cultural unity, its historic landmarks, its historical riches, its	0
At least 29 people were killed and more than 120 others wounded in a dozen car bomb explosions in Baghdad and Kirkuk on Wednesday, police said. In Baghdad, 10 car bombs exploded in the predominately Ã¢ÂÂsecular and poorÃ¢ÂÂ Shia southern suburb of Karrada at the same time as police and soldiers were moving in to clear the dead and wounded, a senior police official said.In one of the attacks, a roadside bomb struck a policeman's car, which then exploded. Another explosion occurred when a car loaded with explosives drove towards an army checkpoint at the junction of Karrada and Sadr City, trapping a number of soldiers near a checkpoint and forcing them to retreat before being killed in return.In another attack, a car loaded with two improvised explosive devices detonated near the army unit in Karrada and nearby Baqaa, killing three policemen and wounding another six soldiers, police said. Five army recruits were also killed and 19 others wounded in the explosion, police said.Another car bomb killed an imam in the southern village of Makhoul, west of Salahuddin, and a parked car exploded near a mosque. At least 30 people were wounded in both attacks, police said.In Baghdad, police said that four car bomb explosions targeted a police commander and his family, killing his son and seven others. The deaths appeared to have been a revenge attack for the assassination of a member of the security forces' local unit in the capital on Sunday, police Colonel Hassan Shorif told Reuters.About a further 20 people were killed in Kirkuk province when a car bomb exploded close to an army checkpoint.In all three attacks police said they had killed more than 20 assailants and wounded many more.Earlier in the day, security forces said they had destroyed a car bomb which was being used to target a Shi'ite militia in a Shi'ite slum in Baghdad. Police say that the bomb killed the alleged bomber, a 29-year-old man, and wounded another 11.A statement from police spokesperson Najim Mohammad Ali said:"The car bomb was detonated at a checkpoint when it was passing through the neighborhood. After the explosion, the car was hit by an explosion and then crashed. Nine passengers and one driver died but a number of others were wounded."Another statement said: "The explosion killed	0
A fire erupted Friday at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed on September 11, 2001, officials said. "There is a potential for 9/11 memorabilia loss due to a small fire" at the Shanksville center, said Mark Potok, a terrorism expert at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.]President Donald Trump will name retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as the next head of the National Security Agency, the White House announced Saturday. Trump had tapped Flynn, an intelligence veteran, for the job in December, and he was considered a leading candidate. The president tweeted Saturday that the announcement was "a great day for the entire country," but he cautioned that people would react differently "depending on what they know.""It's also a great day for America," the president wrote, "because General Michael T. Flynn, who has been subject to almost daily hate from the media, is being confirmed as our national security advisor. After more than a year of Presidential delay, it's about time."The announcement came a few hours after Trump tweeted that he had accepted Flynn's resignation, which he told Time Magazine would take place the next day. Flynn had publicly opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal and other international accords, such as the Paris Climate Accords.The White House said Flynn was to meet with the president that night in Washington for a discussion about the NSA's operations. Flynn was a former director of the Defense Intelligence agency, where, despite his conservative Republican political views, he led a number of successful prosecutions against terrorists and other national security threats. Flynn's most notable accomplishment was an operation to identify an Islamic State operative in Yemen.Flynn told Sean Hannity of Fox News last year that he opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal because he worried it would undermine the U.S. president's ability to make decisions regarding the country.In May 2017, Flynn told a congressional panel that he was resigning the administration's Iran National Security Council because he was worried about the potential for American military action against Tehran."I was concerned, quite frankly, about the consequences of that withdrawal," Flynn said in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "particularly in the event of a conflict with Iran, which I believe could have extremely serious consequences, both militarily and diplomatically."Trump expressed a range of views on Flynn's resignation in his Twitter message Saturday evening.	0
Do you know who Fonso was? Or how about Hindoo? Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did? Ben Brush? Judge Himes? George Smith? Paul Jones? I can. Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race. (Each of them, by the way, was a horse, not a human being.) OK, now can you tell me what each of them didn't do? I can. Each of them did not go on to win horse racing's Triple Crown. I can also tell you why. Because it is a really hard thing to win, that's why. Animal welfare activists: Horse racing industry needs reform Bet you don't know Burgoo King. Hahaha, he made Whoppers, I beat you to it. Laughing out loud here. OK, now I will tell you the sweet and sad tale of Burgoo King, and how maybe he could have become one of the most famous racehorses of all time, a Secretariat, a Seabiscuit, a Man O' War. In 1932, when a lot of people were depressed with a capital D, a lot of them were impressed by Burgoo King when he won the Kentucky Derby by three lengths and then the Preakness by a head. He and the 19-year-old boy in his saddle had a nice shot at winning the Triple Crown, which only two other horses (Sir Barton and Gallant Fox) had done. How did he do? Well, he didn't. Burgoo King was a no-go no-show. He skipped the Belmont Stakes entirely. Did not run. He was "scratched," as they say at the track, just as I'll Have Another was turned into I've Had Enough by his keepers on the eve of today's scheduled Belmont race. Overheard on CNN.com: If wishes were horses, 'Another' Secretariat would rise Would you like to know why? I have no idea. Some horse whisperers spread gossip that Burgoo King's paperwork did not get filled out in time. Others said he must have gotten hurt, but no one confirmed it. All anybody knows for sure is, Burgoo King sizzled, then fizzled. He would not run another race for two full years, and his young jockey was found in Lake Michigan, drowned. Bet you don't know Tim Tam, either.	1
It was a desperate plea from a tearful dad, tossed like a message in a bottle into the vast sea of the Internet. "You ever do something crazy because you just don't know what to do anymore? Well, that's what I'm doing !"It was a desperate plea from a tearful dad, tossed like a message in a bottle into the vast sea of the Internet. "You ever do something crazy because you just don't know what to do anymore? Well, that's what I'm doing !"On July 30, 1994, my mother made her final pilgrimage to California, a trip that was the source of a growing tension in our home. I drove the 587 miles with her that summer, and then we spent those remaining months in relative silence, until one day, out of the blue, my mother came home and called.“I don’t know what to do anymore,” she said.The words shocked us, but they were no surprise to the rest of the world. The news was clear: My mother and her husband, Ronald, had reached the end of the road. They had decided that, before they could continue with their life together, they would have to separate.They had been trying to put their lives back together for years, with mixed success. My mom, who had been a working artist who had been happily married for years, was now divorced. Ronald, a retired aerospace executive turned writer, had a new and troubled relationship with his mother. Now they were at rock bottom.My mother thought they could reconcile their lives together, but not before my father finally told them, “I can’t do this anymore on my own. I don’t know what to do anymore,” he confessed. “This isn’t fair to my children. It’s not fair to my wife.”My father’s wife, Elaine, was so upset she didn’t even speak to her husband during my mother’s visit. She only heard the news from us. The worst part was that my father and his mother had been trying to work out their relationship for years, with no luck, but they were beginning to realize they couldn’t even work it out with each other.They started talking about breaking up, and my father’s wife became the	0
There's a children's book from 1977 called The Big Orange Splot. In it, all the houses on one block look the same. Until one day, when a pelican drops a bucket of orange paint on one roof. Instead of painting over it, and returning to the status quo, Mr. Plumbean decorates the roof—and then the facade, and then the yard—with wild, rainbow patterns. His neighbors think he's lost his mind. But one by one they see the beauty in individual expression, however weird and wacky it may look at first. The popular book sounds like an allegory about communism, and conformist lifestyles. And as it turns out, something similar happened in the Hungarian countryside in the 1960s, during the height of communism. The result—those decorated houses—are the subject of Hungarian Cubes, by Katharina Roters. From 1965 to 1988, János Kádár ran things in Hungary. Unlike the leaders of the other Eastern Bloc countries, Kádár practiced a sort of relaxed strain of communism: the Hungarian People's Republic had a free market, and was tolerant (more than Stalin, at least) of individual voices and public dissent. These policies ultimately became known as "Goulash Communism." It's fitting, then, that during the Goulash Communism era, a peculiar architectural trend took off: People started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes, in wild shades of color. It might be more accurate to say a decorating, or public art movement, began to take off, because the architecture style in question began in the 1920s, long before Kádár's time. It followed the principles of Communist urban planning: city blocks filled with square, economical row houses. They were designed for efficiency, meaning every house was the same, and every house was boring.	1
Painfully hot, they make your eyes water, your heart race and can turn your face embarrassingly red. Chilies have been used for many millenia both for their medicinal benefits and exciting falvor. Once only a staple of ersatz Indian cuisine, these green heat bombs are now a ubiquitous element in our homes and food.Chilies in our diet are a combination of the plant’s ability to provide us with spicy and heat packed foods with the benefit of the seeds and pith of the pepper. However we have been tricked into believing that ‘less is more’, the average chiller in the UK has 4 times the amount of seeds as its counterpart in Spain, 3 times more than its counterpart in Italy, twice as much as its counterparts in China and India.The chilies we know today first started with a simple ingredient in the form of chilies pepper, native to the regions of the world between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These chilies are related to the common chili pepper, but unlike the more commonly known chili pepper, they possess a slightly thinner skin which is not as hard as a typical chili pepper.The plant family from which chilies originate is called Capsicum and there are around 80 different species of capsicum which differ from each other in terms of their colour, shape and size. Capsicum peppers are thought to have originated in Central America (from the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico), but it is believed that they may have traveled across the globe to different areas of the world.Chilies were first used as medicine in ancient times and early versions of the chilies was made from a mixture of the berries (or pods) and seeds of the chilies. The hotness of the chilies was due to the pepper’s heat content, but today’s chilies are highly processed. The peppers are soaked for 24 hours or longer, followed by a series of bleaching operations which result in a final product. Today’s chilies are often made from genetically modified (GM) ingredients.Our diet can make a huge impact on how we feel, but in fact the same principles of food chemistry are responsible for how we digest our food. The reason why we think ‘less is more’ is because we can actually put the same product in a smaller container and have it taste better, so why would we try and control every aspect of	0
The mother of a quadriplegic man who police say was left in the woods for days cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified "treatment," Maryland police said Monday. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Nyia Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday "lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby," Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. "The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. "This kid's obviously a fighter," Walker said during a Saturday news conference. "It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that."	1
A South Carolina judge on Wednesday threw out the convictions of the Friendship Nine, who were jailed in 1961 after a sit-in protest in Rock Hill, South Carolina, during the civil rights movement. "Today is a victory in race relations in America," said Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said in a news conference following the ruling. "It is a new day." The prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day, 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett of Rock Hill, cited King's father when explaining to CNN on Tuesday why he was motivated to take up the cause of the Friendship Nine: "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice." How Friendship Nine ended up back in court The proceedings began at the Rock Hill Law Center with Municipal Judge Jane Pittman Modla reading from the original court record for each of the men. She asked each of the seven men in attendance -- one has since died, while another had transportation issues -- to stand as their names were called. "Offense: trespassing. Disposition: guilty. Sentence: $100 or 30 days. Condition: sent to the chain gang," she said for each of them, reading from the 1961 docket. Retired state Supreme Court Justice Ernest Finney, who was the men's defense attorney in 1961, entered the motion to have the sentences tossed out. The 83-year-old required help standing and propped himself on the table in front of him as he spoke. "May it please the court, today I'm honored and proud to move this honorable court to vacate the conviction of my clients. These courageous and determined South Carolinians have shown by their conduct and their faith that the relief that they seek should be granted. I move for the convictions entered in 1961 to be vacated." Brackett joked that he would probably be best served letting Finney's moving argument stand, but he was compelled to say why he agreed with him. One of the reasons is that the Friendship Nine deserved a "heartfelt apology," which Brackett delivered on behalf of the state.	1
The anti-shark's fin campaign is crusading on in Asia Pacific. Air New Zealand has become the latest airline to stop flying shipments of shark's fin to Hong Kong, the shark's fin capital of the world. The decision came about after the New Zealand ute driver was arrested on the side of the road in Hong Kong. He was carrying a suitcase of shark fin - worth about $200,000. And he pleaded innocent. He said the fin was for his brother, who suffers from a rare genetic illness - anemia called aplastic anaemia. It renders him anemic, but he is otherwise healthy.In the name of this campaign a New York-based shark documentary film is being made, narrated by a French actress, Sophie Nautic. The film, Shark in Hong Kong, will air this month on Discovery. It tells the story of the man arrested for carrying shark fins. And the story - in a way - is about the city. It is a deeply personal story about the city's rich history of its involvement in the wildlife trade, and a tale of a man who has been caught up in that story. And we all share a part in it - not only in Hong Kong, but here in Australia, where the film screening will be shown. It is a film that tells a complicated story and in a very simple way makes us all think about what we could do to make sharks a little less threatened in this corner of the world.I flew to Hong Kong from Kuala Lumpur on the evening of the first day of the film screening. I was on a plane full of new international guests that included New Zealand's own conservationist, Roger Ballantyne, as well as a couple of journalists from the US, a New Zealander and an Australian. It was an exciting flight - the first time I had flown into Hong Kong. From the moment the flight doors parted, the air was filled with sounds and smells of another culture. The Australian journalist in the family found himself in an unfamiliar part of the world.The first sight he saw at the airport was of what was later described as more than 1000 sharks swimming along the water in front of the terminal building. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, and noticed the fish in the water were moving at an extraordinarily fast speed and were so close together, that it looked like they were in one single organism. But they were not. They were	0
Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that. The three-member panel, headed by former defense chief Marshal Houston, made 22 recommendations Monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year. The report's release came after a particularly busy weekend for maritime authorities, who intercepted six separate boats carrying a total of 265 people in the three days to Sunday. It also came as officials investigated claims a boat carrying more than 60 asylum seekers had disappeared en route from Indonesia to Christmas Island, a popular entry point to Australia's asylum system. Read more: Asylum seekers risking all to escape dangers of home Among the Houston report's recommendations was that offshore processing centers be established on the islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea "as soon as practical." It also recommended an immediate increase in the number of people accepted each year for asylum from 13,750 to 20,000. In an effort to reduce the demand for family reunions, it recommended barring people who arrive by boat from being able to sponsor their families to join them. And rather than dumping the government's controversial and illegal "Malaysia Solution," the report recommended building on the deal "through high-level bilateral engagement focused on strengthening safeguards and accountability." Under the so-called "Malaysia Solution," Australia would have sent 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia for processing each year in exchange for 4,000 confirmed refugees. However, the High Court ruled the deal invalid last August on the grounds that, as a non-signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act. Read more: Which countries take in most asylum seekers? Not the West Hours after the report was released, Gillard gave her in-principle backing to all its recommendations and said that Parliament would meet Tuesday to amend the earlier rejected bill to include the provision for processing centers on Nauru and PNG. "We will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion," she added. Refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report, calling it a "rebadging of the Pacific Solution," a reference to the former Liberal government's controversial policy of the last decade.	1
Sitting incongruously among the hangars and laboratories of NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley is the squat facade of an old McDonald's. You won't get a burger there, though -- its cash registers and soft-serve machines have iced the place out since last fall.Instead, you'll find yourself in the first-ever, privately built space station, launched this spring by the billionaire businessman Yuri Milner of London, which will have a crew of six astronauts for a week.The mission will be called Station 1, a project of Milner's called Space Adventures that aims to make commercial spaceflight accessible to ordinary folks. The purpose is to use the station -- slated to be built out of a mixture of recycled air and the materials needed to construct satellites and rockets -- to demonstrate how commercially funded rocket launching could one day be routine for most people."It's a space station," Milner said. "You go, you go to the moon, you go to Mars. What is more important? It's the moon."The purpose of Station 1 is to test a new approach to space travel: Commercial Space Transportation, or CSTEP, which is the name of the contract company whose job it is to build and run the station as well as maintain its systems and astronauts. It is no longer the government.CSTEP is headed by Milner's former chief of communications, Mark Surman, an Australian-born Brit who started work in the U.S. as an engineer working for Northrop Grumman. It's an interesting mix, because it is not the government doing this."There's no government-run station. It's a private company," said CSTEP CEO Milner.In other words, government subsidies would be required for his company to fly people into space.But what does this mean for the commercial space industry?"This really could be it. This could be a sea change," said Brian Weeden, associate professor of government studies at the University of Southern California. "It could be the beginning of the end of the space shuttle program, for a lot of people."For about 2 1/2 years, this small facility has been the home of a different kind of space agency.At 5:30 a.m. on April 13, 1981, the United States Air Force launched an Atlas 5 rocket carrying a	0
Greece and Italy may seem like obvious choices for the discerning traveler because of their iced-over Aegean Sea and sunny Mediterranean climate, respectively. However, they are rarely the case. In both cases, I have had the pleasure of traveling in a country I do not consider to be Greece or Italy. This country is Switzerland! Switzerland has a Mediterranean climate, with warm rainy days and cool, cloudy, rainy nights; it has a Swiss-Italian blend of both languages and people, and it is part of a vast country on the French Riviera that is both culturally rich and economically dynamic. Swiss culture tends to be a little more conservative, but that’s understandable, especially when many of its inhabitants speak both Italian and German. The Swiss are, as always, an exceedingly friendly bunch, and it is easy to understand why Swiss restaurants are so popular with foreigners and why Swiss people are so frequently found walking hand in hand with foreigners.Although the Swiss are generally a laid-back, easygoing bunch, they are not without their share of personality traits. Their sense of humor is one of them. They know how to have fun, and they don’t like to be kept in a corner. If you are lucky enough to meet the Swiss, the most fun is likely to be had with them. The Swiss are a happy, warm, open-minded, and welcoming people. Despite their apparent laid-back attitude, they are fiercely protective of their culture and traditions. The Swiss believe that the best way to know where they come from and where they are headed is by taking a moment to look at all the history that is woven into their lives.Switzerland is the oldest country in the world, founded by Roman emperors and populated by Roman soldiers who were defeated by the French in the late 18th century. For many decades, the country was run as a series of fiefs by the Kings of Zurich, who ruled a confederated empire. Today Switzerland is composed of more than 30 cantons and several hundred towns. In the late 18th century, the Swiss Confederation was founded, with Zurich serving as its seat. For many years, the confederation was run by a king ruling over the entire country. The Swiss monarch was, at the time, the King of France. The King of France was known as Napoleon and was, at that time, the second most powerful man in Europe. His rule allowed the Swiss to	0
Six years ago an ad in the Sunday paper changed a young Pakistani woman's life and made aviation history. Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country's F-7 fighter jets -- though none have  achieved certification.This week, a top F-7 pilot will make history: He'll take a group of his fellow women in Pakistani air force fighter jet pilots on a four-hour training mission. The purpose? To give them the skills they need to fly the F-7 planes as their personal flying training pilots.The pilot they're going to train is Aftab Muhammad, a first-time pilot who's already flying F-7 jets. Muhammad and four other "pilot trainees" will train in a single-engine, single-seat Piper Tomahawk aircraft to earn their licenses to fly the F-7 planes."We've reached a point of no return," Muhammad says about his plan to train women for the F-7 program, which has been plagued by controversy and scandal for years.The F-7s' history dates back to the 1960s. Pakistani Air Force Chief Air Marshal Abdul Basit wrote a memo that stated women shouldn't be allowed to fly fighter aircraft because of "the potential fear of flying" and "the lack of interest" among women in flying. Three women tried anyway, and two were killed. A third pilot was shot out of the sky.Muhammad was one of those pilot trainees.At 25 years old, Muhammad wanted to fly the F-7. "I was a girl, I was a part of the army, I wanted to fly the fighter jet," Muhammad says. "I wanted to fly the F-7. I wanted to make a career for myself."Muhammad's mother worked as a nurse at a hospital in the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. Muhammad was born out of wedlock, and his father was never part of the family. When he was three, the family had no idea who he was."I was always my mother's favorite," Muhammad says. "So I did what she told me to do, and I did what I thought was right."The F-7 program takes its name from the F-7B fighter jet, the first version of a fleet of American-designed fighters that Pakistan designed in the 1970s. The first F-7B made its maiden flight in	0
Hong Kong restaurateur Yenn Wong got quite a surprise one morning earlier this month. The co-founder of popular Hong Kong restaurant Chachawan Isaan Thai and Bar, Wong woke up and logged onto her computer to юоркіїn будимін абагатсевецью.com.

Six people were killed and six were injured when a small plane crashed at Cork Airport in southern Ireland on Thursday, local officials said. Survivors were taken to a local hospital, the Cork County ÃÂÂÃÂÃÂor CentralÃÂÂÃÂÃÂ Hospital.According to Irish television, the victims were travelling to Dublin on the plane while it was at the airport, and they were all from the United States.Local authorities said the plane was a Cessna 208B. Investigators have not confirmed the nationality of the pilot but said he was an American.The plane made a normal approach to take off, but on the runway, the pilot apparently made a mistake and went into a stall.“Our heartfelt sympathies are with the families who have had to suffer a huge loss in the tragic aviation accident today,” said Irish prime minister Enda Kenny.“Ireland is a small country and our thoughts and prayers go out to them and to their loved ones.”The United States embassy told The New York Times that American citizens were aboard the flight. “American citizens were aboard the flight,” said the news agency.The plane circled the airport several times before landing, then came to a stop.“This pilot was in a difficult position. He thought he was making an emergency landing. He could have caused more damage,” said Cork County Council leader John McGrane. “He has to be commended for the skill he demonstrated.” Â©2009 The Irish TimesÂ©2009 The New York TimesÂ©2009 All rights reserved.Â©2009 The New York Times, The New York Times logo, WorldTribune and UPI.Â©2009 The Associated Press.Â©2009 Newspapers.comÂ©2009 Photographs by Nicki Thien.Â©2009 The New York TimesÂ©2009About the AuthorNicki Thien is a staff writer at The New York Times covering politics and education.

College basketball has a new record holder for most points in a game. Last week, Jack Taylor, a 5-foot, 10-inch guard at Iowa's Grinnell College, scored 138 points to lead Grinnell to a 179-104 blowout win over Faith Baptist Bible College, a nearby Iowa college. In setting his scoring record, Taylor made 52 of 108 shots from the field, including 27 of 71 three-point attempts and shot 7 for 10 from the foul line. Taylor's coach and teammates were happy to see him go all out. In the 36 minutes he played, Taylor did not have a single assist. Virtually every time he got the ball, he shot it. Taylor is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree. On February 2, 1954, Bevo Francis, playing for tiny Rio Grande College in Ohio, scored 113 points against Hillsdale College of Michigan. Francis made 38 of 70 shots and hit on 37 free throws in a game that ended with a 134-91 Rio Grande victory. Eleven days after Francis set his record, Frank Selvy of Furman College in South Carolina poured in 100 points in a 149-95 victory over Newberry College. No Division 1 player has ever done as well against a four-year college. Selvy, who finished his senior year with a 41.7 scoring average, had a spectacular shooting night, hitting 41 of 66 field goal attempts and 18 of 22 free throws. In the National Basketball Association, the scoring record belongs to the Philadelphia Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain. Fifty years ago, Chamberlain put up 100 points in a March 2, 1962, game against the New York Knicks, who were missing their starting center. Chamberlain, who at 7-foot-1 towered over his opponents, was never much of an outside shooter, but his "Dipper Dunk" was all he needed. He was unstoppable anywhere near the basket. Taylor's scoring feat is, nonetheless, different from that of the others. They were playing in games in which their opponent was outclassed but still in their league. That was not the case in the Grinnell game. Grinnell is, to be sure, a small college, but Grinnell is far from any small college. Like a series of elite Midwestern schools -- Kenyon, Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester -- Grinnell has an enormous endowment, a superb faculty and a national reputation.	1
Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. "It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis," his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday. Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: "I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family," Jeremy Jarvis said. "I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery." Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she "can't focus on that." "I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now," she said. Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris. "Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy," Schulman said. "He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event." Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is "incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed."	1
Many a modern president has lost momentum and suffered what are termed "scandals" in his second term. President Barack Obama's current problems are part of that tradition. But with the exception of Richard Nixon, scandals have not proven fatal. Indeed,  the three presidents who lost their party's nomination to Bill Clinton were the only ones who ever lost office and their political careers were forever stained.In the case of Clinton, his loss to George W. Bush in 1992 was a scandal of a type that seems almost inconceivable today. But that was the day when Americans learned they could not trust the "politics of scandal."Scandal was a term that, until recently, was used primarily by journalists. But today, it is the term used almost exclusively by politicians. In fact, the phrase "politics of personal destruction" is a well-known feature of American political life.Clinton and Obama both used "scandal" in their press conferences to describe how they had been treated. And they both, in their own way, took full advantage of the term.The Clinton scandals: From the early 1990s until he left office, Bill Clinton used the phrase "politics of personal destruction" to describe the treatment he had received from his opponents, and he gave no apologies for his harsh words.He knew exactly what he meant, as he pointed out that the scandals against him as president had been a personal attack on him personally as a person. And he had no qualms about making that point.In fact, he was so certain of his own understanding of the matter that he was able to make the most eloquent and convincing argument in his own defense. He simply explained that his critics had treated him unfairly and he deserved them."When they talk about scandal, they are talking about the attacks on me personally, not the attacks on America," Clinton said in a speech to the National Press Club in 1995. "They attacked my presidency, they attacked my credibility, they attacked my character, they attacked my honor, they attacked my dignity. My supporters attacked my integrity. They attacked my integrity."The only problem with Clinton's account of the matter was that he was wrong about the nature of the attacks. The media attacks on him were not attacks on him personally, they were attacks on his presidency. These attacks had been waged over a long period of time by a variety of media outlets, not just those of a partisan	0

The remains of Neil Armstrong were committed to the Atlantic Ocean on Friday during repairs at a Navy facility.Rescue personnel will now remove the former astronaut's skull prior to its being flown on a U.S. Navy ship to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.Mr. Armstrong, who died in 2012 at age 82, was part of the first manned spaceflight by a U.S. astronaut.(New York Times)USDA says: California power plant was off-line more than 40 hours; power recovery effort 'continues'10/10/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- At least 1,900 megawatts of California power was off-line more than 40 hours Wednesday, officials said, adding to a concern that the state's cash-strapped electricity grid is vulnerable to a power crunch this weekend. Officials with the state Independent System Operator said Wednesday afternoon that problems with the Transalta plant in south central California's Amador County, which supplies San Diego and southern Orange Counties, was still preventing an adequate supply of electricity to the two states.State officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, blamed the delay on a severe power outage at the Transalta plant that began Wednesday morning and did not end until nearly 5 p.m. ET Wednesday."It's not our fault the power (supply) is not available," said IOS spokesman William Massey. "It's a power shortage there."During the time that the Transalta plant's generating capacity was off, millions of air-conditioning units remained in use in the San Diego area, but most were turned off, IOS officials said.The ISO said its operations and personnel are not affected by the power purchase agreement between California and the state's major utilities, the Governor's Office and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which is trying to avoid rolling blackouts by buying electricity on the open market. "We are not in a situation where the ISO would have to have anything to do with the operation of the power grid," said ISO spokeswoman Kelly Nantel	0
Chris Brown sat alone in court for 35 minutes on Friday while his lawyer talked with the judge and prosecutor behind closed doors in his probation violation case. The judge emerged from his chambers to order Brown to come back on June 10 Â before he could even consider the State's request for an open hearing. State's Attorney Paul Gallegos said he made the request so he could hold a hearing on whether to revoke Brown's probation. Brown's probation was expected to be revoked after his previous drug conviction in 2010. In that case, Brown served two years in prison. But he spent just four months in prison because the State dropped the drug possession charge after Brown's lawyers said it was based on unreliable evidence and was only being used to pressure him into a plea deal. Brown's probation violation allegations stem from an incident in November 2008, when he was arrested after allegedly firing at a man he says was trying to rob him. According to Brown, he was taking a walk with a friend when two men approached them, demanding his belongings. Brown allegedly pulled out a gun and fired shots, striking the man in the arm. Brown said he was just pointing the gun, scared and trying to scare his friend. Police found him guilty, and prosecutors recommended that he serve six months in jail. However, the judge allowed him to spend a month in a halfway house. Brown was released in March 2009, and now he's back in court for the next phase of his probation violation case.LAS VEGAS (AP) - An elderly neighbor pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he threatened to kill a man he says was an intruder inside his Las Vegas home.

Co-founder and executive director of Architecture for Humanity, Cameron Sinclair opened the second Principal Voices debate on Design for Good by outlining just what the term means to him, but also what it means to the communities his design solutions are aimed at. 'When your focus is social change... why wouldn't you want to share that openly?' Taking the ego out of architecture, Sinclair sees the sharing of transformative design ideas as being a moral responsibility of today's designers and architects. "When your focus is social change and not financial change why wouldn't you want to share that openly?" Below are some of Sinclair's thoughts on a number of topics that were discussed at the debate. On shared design "I always think of the design world like the medical world; we have people who are plastic surgeons, but we have a lot of people who are in the emergency room and a lot of our designers are in the emergency room dealing with the critical issues like post-disaster issues or systemic issues or poverty. When I was in college the idea of being a socially responsible architect was unheard of, it was almost taboo: 'We're trying to make jewels in the city', whereas a lot of us wanted to create cities that were jewels." "When your focus is social change and not financial change why wouldn't you want to share that openly? Innovation only succeeds when it's shared. If you're a pioneer and you come up with something that can change the world and you turn round and say 'I'm not going to share this idea with anyone' then you only impact the few and not the many." "But we're in a situation right now where we have to deal with a huge variety of issues. If you have a design idea that can improve the lives of a million people it's almost ethically irresponsible to keep to it yourself." On sustainability "It angers me when sustainability gets used as a buzz word. For 90 percent of the world, sustainability is a matter of survival. When you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology, basically failed developed world technology then you will crush that community way beyond bad design; you'll destroy the economics of that community and often the community socially is broken." "You have to do this marriage between what is appropriate, learning from the local nature, but also can we leapfrog technologies, so we're not burdening people with outdated technologies. If we can come up with that, then it truly is sustainable."	1
Hardly a day that goes by that you won't find Tracey Wygal working out at the gym. Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a "clean diet," keeping a food journal and exercising. The 30-year-old middle-school teacher does cardio exercise, strength trains and follows what she calls a "clean diet." That's quite a change for a woman who tipped the scales eight years ago at 295 pounds. Wygal first started gaining weight in her early teens. A fast-food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds, and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds. "It was my first year out of college, and that number, along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese, was very frightening," remembers Wygal. "I went to several doctors, trying to get them to prescribe a weight-loss pill." But none of her doctors would give her the quick fix she was looking for. Instead, a physician handed her a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet and told her to start moving. At first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive. Even though her weight was rapidly approaching 300 pounds, she believed she had a pretty good diet and an active lifestyle. As her weight crept up, Wygal grew more frustrated, and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life. She started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought.  Watch more from Tracey Wygal on her weight loss success. » "I was amazed by how many calories I was eating," Wygal said. "The food diary showed me that I really needed to get my food intake under control and helped me maintain my diet realistically." She also started exercising. At first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment. "It was all I could do at first. I didn't give up, though," she said. "Gradually, my endurance improved. After losing about 30 pounds, I decided to join a small gym." Several months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step. She hired a trainer and began a short strength-training program. That's when something clicked.	1
Reports of Jade Rabbit's demise may have been premature. China's first lunar rover had stopped functioning, state media reported Wednesday, but signs are emerging that Yutu, as it is known in Mandarin, may be up and running again. Following technical malfunctions Xinhua said that the lunar rover had lost communication with mission control but on Thursday the state news agency said that the rover was "fully awake" and had returned to its normal signal-receiving status. "Jade Rabbit has fully resurrected and is able to receive signals, but still suffers a mechanical control abnormality," China's lunar program spokesman Pei Zhaoyu told Xinhua. "The rover entered hibernation while in an abnormal state. We were worried it wouldn't be able to make it through the extreme cold of the lunar night. But it came back alive. The rover stands a chance of being saved as it is still alive." READ MORE: China's moon landing Xinhua also posted a screenshot of the Chang'e-3 Moon Probe's Sina Weibo account, which, at 8.49am Thursday morning local time, asked: "Is anyone out there?" The rover has over 300,000 followers on the Chinese Twitter-like social media site, some of whom celebrated the lucky robot's resurrection. One Weibo user said that the rabbit was "waking up for the [Chinese lantern] festival" which starts on Friday. Another took a cynical view, commenting that some countries would "be disappointed" at China's space program's ability to come back from the dead. An amateur website dedicated to monitoring radio signals from space also reported on its Twitter account that it had detected "pretty good signals" from the device. The lunar rover's end seemed near when it signed off at the end of January with a poignant message: "Goodnight humanity." READ MORE: China's moon rover launched successfully The device had been out of action for two weeks following a technical malfunction, and media around the world filed its obituary late on Wednesday after a short statement on Chinese state media alerted the world to its apparent terminal failings. "China's first lunar rover, Yutu, could not be restored to full function on Monday as expected," the report stated. However, the robot has given its fans in China and around the world hope that it will resume its planned three-month mission and continue examining the moon's surface for potential resources.	1
Rescuers searched for survivors Sunday after a landslide in northwestern Colombia killed at least 18 people and trapped dozens of others, Red Cross officials said. Workers were manually removing rubble as rescue dogs searched for signs of life, said Cesar Uruena, national relief director for the Colombian Red Cross. "We have to be very careful, thinking of the people that could be alive," he said. Heavy rains caused the landslide, which buried about 16 homes in the city of Manizales early Saturday morning, Red Cross spokesman Leandro Soto said. CNN affiliate Caracol showed images of buckled rooftops jutting out beneath a massive mound of earth. "We cannot lose hope. We are still hoping to find more people alive," Soto said. Thirteen people have been rescued from the rubble, Soto said, including five whom crews pulled out Saturday night, 15 hours after the landslide. Sixteen people were being treated for injuries, Uruena said. About 100 rescuers were working in shifts at the scene, he said. Psychological support teams were also on hand to counsel victims and their families, Soto said.	1
As debt-ridden Greece braces for strikes while its prime minister attempts to reassure Europe that his country will pay its bills, the 17 eurozone countries are in various stages of deciding whether to approve the expansion of Europe's bailout fund. The proposed enhancements to the European Financial Stability Facility would allow the fund to increase its lending capacity from â‚¬250 billion to â‚¬440 billion and buy sovereign bonds in capital markets -- a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves. Europe's leaders originally hoped that the EFSF would never have to be used; now they are hoping the fund's new powers will be enough to prevent the collapse of the eurozone. First they will have to pass the measures. Here's a rundown of where the countries stand and the dates their governments approved (or are expected to approve) EFSF expansion. YET TO APPROVE Estonia -- September 29 The Estonian parliament passed one of two necessary resolutions to ratify EFSF expansion earlier this week, despite attempts by the country's main opposition party to block the changes on the grounds that one of the eurozone's poorer states simply cannot afford to help bailout failing eurozone economies. Final approval is expected on Thursday. Malta -- October 3-7 Malta joined Finland in its demand that Greece put up collateral in exchange for any additional bailout money that Malta would pay into the EFSF. But it is unclear whether Malta will join the Finns in dropping that requirement before passing EFSF enhancement. Either way, approval and ratification of any proposed plan cannot happen until lawmakers return from recess on October 3. Netherlands -- October 3-7 Once opposed to expanding the rescue fund, the Dutch are now expected to approve enhanced EFSF measures with a parliamentary vote by the end of the first week of October -- although hardliners in the government continue to call for the private sector to take on more of the debt burden. Cyprus -- October 3-7 The Cypriot cabinet has approved the measures and parliament is expected to ratify the EFSF expansion sometime during the first week of October. Slovakia -- Mid to late October One of the eurozone's poorest countries is also the biggest obstacle to enhancing the EFSF -- and members of the governing coalition's refusal to approve the plan means a parliamentary vote may not happen until mid-October. Portugal -- End of October	1
As Ashton Kutcher becomes the first to collect 1 million followers on Twitter and Oprah Winfrey sends out her first tweet, tech observers are debating: Does Friday mark a new peak for the microblogging service? Or the beginning of its demise? Ashton Kutcher told Larry King Friday that the battle was about proving one person can have a voice. Some bloggers and Twitter users have expressed concern that the once-cultish site is being overwhelmed by celebrities and media hype, while others are excited by Twitter's ever-growing reach. "It's a big milestone. This brings Twitter mainstream," said Andrew Cherwenka, a Huffington Post contributor and Web developer at Trapeze.com, referring to Kutcher and Winfrey's Twitter breakthroughs. "A lot of people are saying this is going to be the death of Twitter, and I don't understand that at all," Cherwenka added. "It's just another stage in Twitter's acceleration." "The challenge for Twitter -- besides, of course, getting a business model in place to handle the infrastructure required to sustain this kind of growth -- is going to be maintaining the fact that it's the community at large, not the celebrity users, that's at the core of this service," said Caroline McCarthy, who writes a CNET News blog about social media. "The power of Twitter is about the millions of people using it and how easily it is to filter and aggregate their thoughts and conversations," McCarthy told CNN. "It can't be all about Ashton and Oprah." In the much-publicized duel, Kutcher's Twitter account crossed the 1 million mark on Twitter about 2:13 a.m. ET Friday, narrowly beating CNN's breaking-news feed, which had 998,239 followers at the time. CNN passed the mark at 2:42 a.m. ET. On Friday, Kutcher went on "Larry King Live" to talk about the battle and why he felt the duel was so important. "We now live in an age in media that a single voice can have as much power and relevance on the Web, that is, as an entire media network," he said. "And I think that to me was shocking."

More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars. "The fusion" of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel the members to become more cooperative and "in a sense to become one.""There is a need," he wrote in a 1956 essay, "to realize a new social solidarity. We will need the discipline of economic union for this. It will require a union of nations, but economic union cannot be merely a question of customs and treaties, or even of political and diplomatic agreements. It cannot be a matter of agreements between governments on the basis of an international agreement."It took the end of the Cold War and the rise of globalization to prove Monnet right. The European Union has been more than just a union of nations—it has become a global economy. Its economy is now about 27 percent of the world's economy and is growing at an average of 5.8 percent per year.The EU's growth has led to some significant changes in how Europeans and Americans in particular think about and treat each other. It also has opened the door for a new "global Europe" to replace the old Europe of nation-states. But it has also opened the door to a new debate over the European Union's future role in world affairs. The question, as always, is a much more nuanced one: What is the EU's new role in the world today? And what are its new responsibilities going forward?This chapter looks at these questions, beginning with the EU's evolving role in global affairs as it faces the challenges of globalization—the interlocking, global economic, security, and technological changes that have transformed the nature of global politics and the European Union's economic and security role.### **EU ENERGIES**In recent years, a number of developments in global and European affairs have sparked debate about whether the EU's role is evolving or simply becoming more global. The year 2011 marked a milestone: the beginning of the first decade of the twenty-first century. That year's marked the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the entry into force of the 1992 Single European Act (SEA)—the largest legislative act ever passed by the European Union.The SEA, which was designed to create unity in Europe and	0
Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) -- The first time I went to Libya, in 2010, I was arrested just two days into my trip. Filming a documentary for VICE, I was detained for shooting where the authorities thought I shouldn't, beginning endless rounds of questions, emphatic yelling and head-shaking incredulity at my claims of innocence -- and, of course, the requisite implications that I was a spy. When I was finally released, I swore I would never return to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. But that promise was quickly broken, and I found myself back in the country almost exactly a year later, in the midst of a chaotic and violent revolution. My second trip to Libya consisted of traveling from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then onto the front lines in Misurata, embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way. I was shocked by how young many of them were. Barely past puberty and fighting with whatever they could find (one guy had a spear gun), they displayed so much heroism and courage that I would tear up while talking to them. One rebel I spoke with had left the hospital earlier that night -- despite having lost a leg -- so that he could get back to the front lines. He was offered a flight to Germany and a new prosthetic limb by an NGO, but instead snuck out of the hospital to rejoin his comrades. But the big question looming over everything was: "Why are they fighting?"	1
A convicted child pornographer in Pennsylvania was sentenced Tuesday to 12 years in federal prison, thanks in part to three girls featured in CNN's Freedom Project who provided information to U.S. authorities. Jeffrey Herschell, 54, of Washington, Pennsylvania, visited an Internet site that showed live sex shows that forced young girls in the Philippines to act out customers' fantasies, U.S. investigators said. "Whatever the American client wants us to do, we must do it," "Gen" told CNN in May 2011 for the documentary "The Fighters." "Gen" and her friends were schoolmates and just 8 years old when the abuse occurred. An investigator from Homeland Security Investigations, part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN the information the three girls provided him was integral to the case against Herschell. Their information launched an investigation that uncovered a ring operating live-streaming shows of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Customers from around the globe, including an estimated 10 to 15 from the United States, paid to view the shows and direct them, in some cases. When HSI agents executed a search warrant on Herschell's home in 2011, they found computers, cell phones and hard drives containing dozens of explicit videos and images of children. The inquiry involved several U.S. agencies, the Philippines national police and the non-profit group Visayan Forum Foundation, which fights modern-day slavery.

The Supreme Court sided with Congress on Thursday in the high-stakes power struggle over presidential recess appointments, in which officials are placed in top government jobs temporarily without Senate approval. The justices' unanimous ruling on the narrowest of grounds against the Obama administration could invalidate hundreds of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency at the center of this legal fight. At issue is whether three people named by President Barack Obama to the board were ineligible to serve because their appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a "pro forma" session during the 2011-12 winter holiday break. That meant the mostly empty chamber was convening every three days without any business conducted, and with the sessions lasting only minutes at most. The court majority concluded recess appointments would be valid if those breaks lasted 10 days or more. The Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval. But more recently, lawmakers have sought to thwart certain appointments by never technically shutting down the Senate. The closely watched constitutional and political confrontation over the practice has accelerated because of partisan gridlock in Congress. Presidential spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that the White House was "deeply disappointed" in the decision and said the administration is "still reviewing it." The court's opinion will not have an immediate effect, since Democrats controlling the Senate imposed rules making it harder for Republicans to block Obama's nominees. But a change in Senate control after November's midterm elections could renew the disagreements. "We conclude that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue," Justice Stephen Breyer said. "We hold that the Senate is in session, and not in recess, when the Senate says that it is in session." But the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the Senate goes on break. To achieve unanimity, the court took a limited approach, avoiding a decision that could have applied to greater set of recess scenarios, thereby further blunting the executive's power. Four conservative justices wanted their colleagues to go farther, and complained the majority "bends over backwards" to preserve some of the President's options. That gives both branches some room to claim even a partial victory. Senate officials weigh in	1
Peaches Geldof, the daughter of musician Bob Geldof and the late Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose after relapsing into use of the illegal drug following attempts to give it up, an inquest heard Wednesday. The death of the 25-year-old TV host in April at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, shocked the entertainment world. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently. Geldof, who had two children younger than 2, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2Â½ years, being prescribed methadone, he said. She had said she wanted to come off methadone completely and was following a reduction plan. A drug test in November indicated that she was not taking any illegal drugs, he said. However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that she had started using heroin again. High-grade heroin Fotheringham's report to the inquest gave new details of Geldof's death. Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said. Inside was a bag containing what tests proved to be heroin as well as a bag of citric acid, used to make the heroin more soluble in water for injection, according to the report. The bag also held dozens of syringes, some sealed while others contained traces of a brown residue, alcohol wipes, cotton buds and cards advertising a needle exchange in central London. According to a police drug expert, PC Adrian Parsons, the heroin found was of "importation quality" -- that is, with a purity of 61%, compared with the average 26% purity found at street level. The 6.91 grams (about a quarter-ounce) recovered would have been worth Â£350 to Â£550 (about $600 to $940), Fotheringham said. Burnt spoon, knotted tights Geldof was discovered sitting slumped on a bed in the spare bedroom by her husband, rock musician Tom Cohen, who went to their home after he became concerned when he couldn't contact her.	1
Star Wars" makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, who helped create Chewbacca, Yoda, Jabba the Hutt and the otherworldly creatures in the trilogy's famous barroom scene, has died, Lucasfilm said Wednesday. He was 98. A creature effects artist, Freeborn also worked on other film classics and was responsible for creating the apelike human ancestors in the "Dawn of Man" sequence in "2001: A Space Odyssey." He also did the makeup for Peter Sellers in "Doctor Strangelove," Lucasfilm said on its starwars.com website. "Stuart was already a makeup legend when he started on 'Star Wars,'" said George Lucas, creator of the films. "He brought with him not only decades of experience, but boundless creative energy. His artistry and craftsmanship will live on forever in the characters he created. His 'Star Wars' creatures may be reinterpreted in new forms by new generations, but at their heart, they continue to be what Stuart created for the original films," Lucas said in a statement. Playful, impish and imaginative, Freeborn played a pivotal role in developing the character Yoda for "The Empire Strikes Back." Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put his own image into Yoda the Jedi Master, giving the character inquisitive and elfin features with "more than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself," Lucasfilm said. Freeborn also put his skills to work in "Oliver Twist," "The Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Omen," four "Superman" films, "Top Secret!" and "The Great Muppet Caper." Among the more memorable sequences in the "Star Wars" film is the Mos Eisley Cantina, which Freeborn and his team populated by creating Greedo, Walrus Man and Snaggletooth. He also worked on the tauntaun and wampa ice creatures in "The Empire Strikes Back." "Return of the Jedi" is considered the "monster movie" of the trilogy, and Freeborn and his team in the United Kingdom developed Jabba the Hutt, which was a massive puppet, and the teddy-bear-like Ewoks. He was often joined in his makeup work by wife Kay, who died last year, and son Graham, who died in 1996. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived	1
The fiberglass head weighed 600 pounds and resembled Clarabell the Clown from the 1950s "Howdy Doody Show." Bill Ziegler, owner of the Wild Bill's nostalgia store, stumbled across it on an artist's Web site and wondered if it would work for a project he had in mind. Salem Sue stands watch in New Salem, North Dakota. She measures 38 feet tall and 50 feet long. Ziegler recruited the artist to help him attach the giant head to his 33-foot farm silo. By October 2008, the pair had built the world's largest jack-in-the-box. The jack-in-the-box extends 50 feet in the air, moving up and down approximately once a minute. "They love it," Ziegler said of the tourists who come to his store. He's had visitors from as far away as England -- one couple who saw the story of the jack-in-the-box in a British newspaper decided to stop by. All across the country, roadside attractions like this one bring surprise and delight to travelers who just have to get a closer look. "In many parts of the country, you can plan an entire road trip where you visit nothing but 'world's largest' attractions," said Doug Kirby, the publisher of RoadsideAmerica.com. Kirby's Web site pays homage to odd attractions -- from Ziegler's jack-in-the-box in Middletown, Connecticut, to the world's largest ketchup bottle in Collinsville, Illinois, to the world's largest sundial in Carefree, Arizona.

Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance. He worried about the comics being banned in Saudi Arabia - which wound up happening, briefly --  but he never thought the Saudi Kingdom would ban his work outright.He started publishing his comic book series Muhammad (The comics) in 2015, drawing on the Quran as his source material after leaving Sudan. His project was inspired by a similar comic book from Saudi Arabia, called Dabiq, whose creator is now imprisoned in the country for blasphemy.“Every time he (Dabiq’s creator) would publish a new story, I was so angry,” Al-Mutawa tells Al Jazeera. “The way he portrayed the prophet (Muhammad) was so extreme. I was in a very bad mood and I went to the library to look up the book on Islam.”In the late 2000s, Al-Mutawa fled Saudi Arabia because he wanted out of the country where he believes he was discriminated against for his religious faith.“I had no choice to leave,” he says. “For seven years I lived in Saudi Arabia. I was very poor at that time. I had a roof over my head and was always at work as a driver in the service industry. I even received money for the sake of my family. I always received work and paid a lot because they accepted me as a Muslim and accepted me as a Muslim.”“There is no other Muslim country where I can go, but for seven years I couldn’t go, for two years I couldn’t go, and for a year and a half I couldn’t go, and they sent me to the airport, so why didn’t I go to the airport if I didn’t have to leave? I was always being humiliated and I was always being treated like an untrustworthy person. I didn’t want to die but I was just trying to find my way to freedom, and that was my priority.”After leaving Saudi Arabia, he worked hard in an effort to return to Sudan, but he faced many challenges. Some of these challenges were self-inflicted, while others became the targets of government censorship.“Things started getting worse when I started getting threats	0
From the rooftop of a mosque in the Cairo district of Nasr City, I watched as thousands of supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy frantically waved posters and chanted angrily. Moments before they iced him on stage, they had vowed to do so.The crowd was not organized or disciplined. It was chaotic and disorganized in ways that make it appear more like a mass rally. This was not an organized protest movement. It was a riot—a mob ready to do anything, and thinking it can do anything to overthrow the president it loathes. The men who have led this mob have nothing in common with the men who have led the Egyptian Revolution.Morsy was a hero for millions of Egyptians. There is no single reason he should have been removed from office. He is a man who rose from a broken home and was elected President in 2012 by an overwhelming margin of nearly 80 percent.His supporters believed he had given them a chance to run the country. They were wrong.He has been a hero. He has been vilified. He is a man with whom many of us have had strong disagreements.But he is also a man who led his country into one of the most significant political and economic transformations of modern history. It was Morsy, not the Muslim Brotherhood, that delivered freedom and an end to political violence after a thirty-two-year dictatorship. It was his decision to adopt a constitution (a document more than twice as long as the USA constitution), to move from a presidential system with a single-person presidency to a parliamentary form of government and then to accept a second and third round of voting that gave him his victory. It is his determination to be a beacon of stability in a country with a political and economic crisis that many people are losing faith in.I believe Morsy would have been better served by leaving his supporters to rally, rather than taking the microphone and delivering his resignation speech.At the outset, he did not even want to appear on the balcony of the presidential palace—he made that clear when he met with reporters outside the palace. The first person he talked to in the streets, outside his residence, was his chief of staff, Hany Sadat. He did not want to appear before the media to address the nation at a time when he was under pressure, and he was not prepared to meet with reporters only to resign. It quickly	0
A landslide buried 83 workers in a mining area in the Tibet Autonomous Region on Friday morning, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing local authorities. The incident occurred about 6 a.m. in Maizhokunggar County, east of Lhasa, the regional capital. The victims, including two Tibetans, were workers from Tibet Huatailong Mining Development Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group Corp., the news agency said. The landslide extended three kilometers (almost two miles) and was made up of about 2 million cubic meters (2.6 million cubic yards) of mud, rock and other debris, the regional government said.	1
Jobs and money, national identity and political stability. These are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in Taiwan this weekend. Seeking another four-year term is the incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou of the ruling Kuomintang Party, pitted against Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Who wins the election will influence Taiwan's relations with mainland China and impact business, geopolitics and security in the region, including China-U.S. ties. For many Taiwanese electorates, political observers say, the main issues are jobs, economics and Taiwanese identity. For the policy-makers in Beijing, however, the overriding question is whether the next Taiwan president will stick to the status quo. That means abiding by the "1992 Consensus," a tacit and ambiguous agreement reached 20 years ago between Beijing and Taipei under which both sides agreed on the principle of "one China" without agreeing on how it is to be defined or interpreted. Despite the ambiguity, the 1992 Consensus has served as the basis for cross-strait dialogue that has led in recent years to the unprecedented blossoming of economic and people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait. In Beijing's view, "zuguo tongyi," or reunification of the motherland, is a matter of national pride and iron-clad policy. Beijing says it prefers to do so peacefully but refuses to rule out the use of force to keep Taiwan from declaring itself a separate state. China keeps hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan, an ominous threat to the island to stay in the fold. War in the Taiwan Strait would prompt a China-U.S. standoff. In 1954, the U.S. and Taiwan signed a mutual defense treaty. Even now, Washington sells Taiwan advanced jet fighters and other military hardware. America is also bound by the Taiwan Relations Act, U.S. legislation passed in 1979, to consider an attack on the island as "a threat to the peace and security" of the region and "of grave concern to the U.S." But all these years, Washington has avoided spelling out what it would do in case military clash erupts in the Taiwan Strait. Some observers say such ambiguity serves as a deterrent. Others worry it could lead to miscalculations. That delicate balance lurks at the heart of this weekend's election.	1
David Nalbandian was disqualified in the ATP Queen's Club final Sunday for angrily kicking down an advertising board and injuring a court side official. The Argentinian was leading Croatia's Marin Cilic by a set and trailed 3-4 in the second, having just dropped his service, when the incident occurred. A Cilic serve to his forehand saw Nalbandian unable to return and he took out his frustration on the board, which was just in front of line judge Andrew McDougall. The force of Nalbandian's kick left McDougall with a nasty gash to his leg and he stood up to protest to the player. Umpire Fergus Murphy halted play before ATP supervisor Tom Barnes came onto the court to speak to him and the 30-year-old Nalbandian, who was officially defaulted for "unsportsmanlike behavior." He later returned to apologize for his actions to the 6,000 capacity crowd at the club in London. "I am sorry to do that. Sometimes we get very frustrated here on court. It is tough to control," he said. "It is a mistake. It is a tough moment to end a final like that. Sometimes we feel the pressure from the ATP. It is a mistake and I have to pay for that. Everybody makes mistakes." A subdued Cilic was handed the tournament trophy, the first ATP title for the 23-year-old since winning in St Petersburg in October last year. Federer shocked by Haas in Halle final "It was very bitter. It's definitely not the way I wanted to win," Cilic said. "I can't change it, but I'm really sorry for the fans that it finished like this." Tournament director Chris Kermode told BBC Sport that officials had been left with no other option than to default Nalbandian. "David is struggling to come to terms with it. He clearly regrets what happened -- but these things happen. "Queen's is sold out and the spectators are watching some great tennis, so to have the match end this way is quite disappointing. "But there's not a lot we can do about it. We are under the governance of ATP rules." Kermode added that McDougall had been taken to the tournament's medical center to have attention for his injured leg.	1
I live in Chicago, and one of my best friends, Phyllis, lives in San Francisco, so we aren't able to see each other as often as we would like. The times we do get together, we like to talk about some of our favorite things -- the weather, food, etc. Sometimes I bring up some of my favorite recipes from my cookbook, The New Healthy Cookbook. I thought I would share this photo ofmy latest creation with you. My friend used to always bring in bagels with cream cheese spread, and I have been searching for my own recipe. It is really very simple to prepare, and there are twoingredients you will need: cream cheese spread and a bagel. The beauty of this dish is that both of these ingredients are low fat, so they both don't contain any saturated fats or cholesterol.I used to always enjoy making these bagels with cream cheese spread, and I think this is one of my favorites. After I made this, I decided to try out some of my own favorites in cream cheese spread,and as you can see, they are all very different!1. Measure the ingredients and set the oven to 300 degrees. Cream together both softened cream cheese and soft margarine.2. Roll out the dough and use a cookie cutter to cut out as many bagels as possible. Place them in a baking pan and bake them for 15-20 minutes.3. While the bagels are baking, prepare a sauce by mixing together the flour, water, milk and sugar.4. Take the bagels out of the oven when they are slightly crispy.5. Spread two tablespoons of cream cheese spread on both bagel halves, and top with a strawberry.6. For the top of the bagel, I found a thin black icing that I would melt a small bowl in the microwave to pour on top of the cream cheese spread. Then, I rolled the top of each bagelwith a bagel cutter and the icing to make it look like a cookie cutter. It was too hard to get the icing to look like the bagel when I tried. I'm sure I can figure it out though.As usual, there are pictures of me on my blog! If you like one or two of these recipes, you can see more of my blog. I hope you'll be able to find some great recipes there	0
The woman who Jennifer Aniston, Cher, Melanie Griffith and other stars have trusted with their skin allegedly couldn't be trusted with their credit cards, according to federal authorities. Federal agents arrested Beverly Hills spa owner Gabriella Perez on charges of using her celebrity clients' credit card information to make fraudulent purchases totaling at least $280,000, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Perez, who described herself as a "skin artist" on her business website, was arrested without incident Wednesday afternoon, the prosecutor's office said. Chez Gabriela Studio is "the temple of beauty" for Beverly Hills, its website said. "Gabriela is my favorite ass kicking facialist," the website quoted Cher saying. "She is the Michelangelo of skin care!" The criminal complaint named actress Liv Tyler as a major victim, with $214,000 in allegedly fraudulent charges made by Perez on her American Express card last year. High-end jewelry designer Loree Rodkin was the first client to alert federal investigators, the complaint said. The complaint alleges Perez "fraudulently charged numerous times on her (Rodkin's) Visa credit card from the studio." When Rodkin's lawyer tried to resolve the charges with Perez, she allegedly offered her $25,000 in services in exchange for the $68,000 in allegedly fraudulent charges, the complaint said. The list of victims, based on information given to investigators by Rodkin's lawyer, included Cher, Aniston, Tyler, Griffith, Anne Hathaway and Scott Speedman, the complaint said. The spa's website says its celebrity clientele also includes Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Amber Valletta and Mia Wasikowska.	1
First it was McLaren, now it's the turn of Ferrari to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming Formula One season. The sport's oldest team, based in Maranello, Italy unveiled their new F14 T ilaro at a media event at the company's headquarters in Maranello, Italy, with the Italian media recording the news. The team's chief technical officer, Michael Shank, said: "The Ferrari spirit is that we will always give ourselves the best chance to win, and that's what we want. This is a car that is going to make us even more competitive in the future." The F14 T ilaro comes in three- and five-door varieties, and will be powered by Ferrari's new V8 engine, which has a displacement of 2.3 megawatts, and has been described by its technical director, Massimo Rivola, as the most powerful engine in the history of the sport. The F14 T ilaro features a V8 engine that is three-liters and has a displacement of 2,150cc and is mated with a six-speed sequential gearbox.A five-door Ferrari F14 T ilaro is in the works, and will make its debut in 2014, according to Italian media reports. The details of the new car's development are unclear, however it is understood that some changes have occurred to the V8 engine, and will be shared with the F1 team in order to be competitive. According to sources the 5-door model will use a lighter powerplant which is reportedly only 2.1 megawatts. While the engine will probably also be lighter the F14 T ilaro is expected to be lighter by about 30 percent than its predecessor. Shank believes that the F14 T ilaro's development has been "a long time" in the making and that the first model made available to the public will soon be ready for testing. The team's chief technical officer, Michael Shank, said: "The Ferrari spirit is that we will always give ourselves the best chance to win, and that's what we want.

A suicide bombing "mastermind" in the Pakistan Taliban has been gunned down and killed in the country's northeastern tribal region, just days after a major faction in the militant group announced it was breaking away over Âinternal squabbles.Abdullah Irmatullah, a spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was a member of the group's military committee and was responsible for orchestrating the October 3 attack on the Peshawar school that caused a string of casualties.A military official told reporters that four Taliban militants opened fire at Irmatullah, killing him and then escaped.Pakistan's Taliban militants released a statement announcing today that Irmatullah, who was also known as "Jihadi Abdullah," was killed in early fighting in the lawless Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) region in the country's northeast.Irmatullah was killed after a local militant group, the Haqqani Network, said on October 4 that they were breaking away from the TTP.The announcement marked the first official break in the TTP, which is widely seen as the most powerful of Afghanistan's two main Taliban factions.Although Pakistan's TTP had been linked to the recent bombings in Sri Lanka and the US attack on a Pakistan hospital that killed 17 people, it had been largely inactive since the 2001 invasion that brought Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud to power.After the 2001 US invasion that ousted former dictator Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistan government had imposed a crackdown on the Afghan Taliban movement which had been blamed for a string of deadly attacks, including the 2009 attack on the Lal Masjid mosque, where a dozen people were killed.However, since then, the Pakistani Taliban, led by Mehsud, have launched a series of attacks against Pakistani targets, including the military, security and police forces.In recent months, the group have launched dozens of attacks across Pakistan, including a deadly suicide attack on a Lahore hospital in August 2012 that killed nearly 100 people. The TTP are estimated to have killed more than 4,400 people during its rule between 2001 and 2010.The Pakistani Taliban have been accused of responsibility in the assassination of former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a US drone attack which killed him in 2011.After Pakistan's US-backed military launched its operation	0
Does a week go by without news of federal bureaucrats outrageously extending their tentacles of authority over more of society? Earlier this month it was the Environmental Protection Agency, announcing its plan to introduce on its own the carbon dioxide limits that Congress specifically rejected. Then it was the Food and Drug Administration, insinuating itself into the centuries-old process of aging cheese. Last week it was the IRS trying to shed at last the inconvenience of congressional oversight. Now the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is claiming sweeping authority over our smartphones, asserting the right to approve any software that might be used in a car. This would likely make the smartphone the first object ever to be regulated both as a medical device and as a piece of motor vehicle equipment. Yet surprising as it may seem to consumers, the matter is clear to NHTSA regulators, who "maintain that they already have the authority over navigation aids and merely want it clearly written into law," according to The New York Times. NHTSA, the Times reports, believes that apps like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze pose threats to highway safety that entitle the agency to demand changes to their user interfaces -- matters which are far outside the auto regulator's zone of expertise. Under the same principle, of course, NHTSA's control could soon creep beyond the navigation apps. Any software that might theoretically be used while driving could fall under the agency's regulatory powers: music applications, news alerts and e-mail notifications, even the phone function itself could be construed as threats to highway safety. What's next? Atlases? AAA maps? Printed directions? Coffee cups from the McDonald's drive-through? NHTSA has already pushed car manufacturers to adopt "voluntary" regulatory standards for their in-car navigation systems, but technology companies have not been so willing to hand federal regulators the keys to one of their core products. If they're smart, companies like Google and Apple will fight to keep it that way. For my book "Breakout," I interviewed Robert Norton, a former assistant general counsel for Chrysler who spent much of his career negotiating with NHTSA, including stints at each of the American Big Three auto companies. "There's so much soft power that NHTSA has over the industry," Norton told me, "because you're always needing extensions and exemptions and 'Can I have 60 more days to give you this report?' And generally you are expecting to get the 'Mother-may-I' permission on that."	1
Three French journalists charged in an alleged plot to kidnap African children for adoption in Europe arrived in Paris on Sunday, hours after French President Nicolas Sarkozy held emergency talks in Chad. But 14 other people remained in custody in utes where they had been held since last Friday pending a series of court hearings.While the French journalist, Robert Verkaik, was charged with illegal entry under immigration law, he denied the charges, saying he had come to France on a valid tourist visa, not as a tourist, and had taken his passport back from police. He was due to appear for interrogation at the offices of the Drome, a court of first instance.In a statement released by the UFS, the French National Federation of Journalists, which represents journalists, said it was “profoundly concerned” by the charges against Verkaik, saying he would be placed “in a very difficult situation.”The group said Verkaik had been followed by police for several hours on his way to a restaurant in the Paris suburb of Auteuil.Story continues below advertisement“He had been under surveillance over a long period of time and was not in any real danger,” said the statement, which added that while media coverage of the case since May 11 had been “critical,” “this does not give rise to any cause for concern.”The UFS statement said a journalist “is a citizen who carries the responsibility not to violate any laws” when visiting a country, such as travel to a European Union nation.“It is not an issue between a journalist and a minister, it is a political issue between a journalist and a government,” it said.Verkaik works for the online news site Mediapart, and had just released a report examining the growing number of children that are forced to migrate alone to Europe.The report said the process of forcibly removing children from their parents is happening in Africa as well, with the United Nations estimating that up to 150,000 children have been taken from their parents through the process over the past 15 years.It is feared that more than 200,000 children under the age of 15 have migrated this way to Europe since 2000.“France is a country whose government is strongly committed to the fight against trafficking in human beings and is trying to put	0
Signing up for Obamacare has become a part-time job for Susan Lane. Starting the minute healthcare.gov went live October 1, Lane spent five to six hours a day trying to make the site work before she finally managed to enroll two weeks  later.“I wanted to wait until the fall to enroll because I thought it would be a little more difficult,” said Lane, who earns $9.50 an hour as a bookkeeper at a community college in the Washington, D.C. area. (Read more Obamacare enrollment stories.) Healthcare.gov was not designed by computer experts, but by programmers from Apple and Google. But it worked, because people like Lane, who were smart enough to learn their way through the website, were among the many who got it right the first time.“It wasn’t until I saw Susan’s story on CNN that I learned the system was as I described it – they had the wrong number,” said Joni Hecht, the CEO of the National Association of Health Underwriters. “I have never seen it before. As a business owner, I can only shake my head.”Healthcare.gov opened Oct. 1, and the online enrollment period is now officially in effect. With the site live, people have a lot for them to do to sign up. There’s an application. There’s an online tutorial. There’s a video on the site. As of Monday morning, some 20,000 individuals had signed up over the two-and-a-half weeks since the open enrollment period began. Another 30,000 have filed for insurance plans through an insurance broker, and many people are still enrolled in other state-based plans.Obama has called for all Americans to sign up for government plans, but Republicans in Congress have blocked the effort, claiming that there’s no evidence that private insurance has been in better shape since private insurers left the market several years ago.The House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this year that would prohibit the use of federal funds to pay for private insurance plans, but the GOP-controlled Senate did not approve the bill, which would have prevented millions from getting coverage through the online exchanges.It’s unclear whether the lack of federal funds for private insurance plans will ultimately affect the millions of people who will sign up for plans through	0
She predicted events that unfolded in the Middle East well before they happened. And her book on Iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country. Veteran journalist and author Sandra Mackey died Sunday, her son, Colin Mackey, said. She was 77. Her extensive career began in anonymity. She was an undercover reporter working for U.S. newspapers from Saudi Arabia as her husband, Dr. Dan Mackey, worked in a Riyadh hospital. For four years, she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around Saudi Arabia's prohibition on foreign journalists. Her work appeared under the pseudonym Michael Collins. As she chronicled what was happening around her, Mackey's distinctive voice began to emerge. Over the years, a stream of books followed. "The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom" offered "a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of Saudi social and public life," The New York Times wrote. Her 1992 book "Passion and Politics: The Turbulent World of the Arabs" helped bridge gaps in understanding between Arabs and Americans, critics wrote. Mackey wrote for the people she knew, in a layman's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher. "Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans," Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal. After earning a history degree from the University of Central Oklahoma, Mackey attended the University of Virginia to study international relations. She graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program. For her book on Iran, Mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied, allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change. Her 2002 book "The Reckoning -- Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein" portended some of the outcomes of the war in Iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism. "If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf," Mackey wrote in the book. "We will be sucked into the resentments of the Arab world, the hostilities of the Iraqis, and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of American vital interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.''	1
Joseph Horman already had seen the lock-picking videos on YouTube. But it was a different thing entirely for the 13-year-old puzzle-lover to get lessons in lock picking and computer hacking at an event sanctioned by adults. The world's largest gathering of computer hackers -- DEF CON, which is happening this weekend at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas -- held its first-ever hacking classes for kids this year, at an event appropriately called DEF CON Kids. Sessions in hacking were designed for kiddos ages 8 to 16. A common parent's reaction to something this might be: They're teaching them what?! But hear these hackers out. Their intentions are good. Take Horman's uncle, Adam Steed, a computer security professional in Salt Lake City, Utah, who brought his nephew to these training sessions because he already was fascinated with games and coding. (He actually has written his own computer game, called "Blooks," in which players "try to build as many buildings as you can while avoiding enemies," he said.) "You can watch lock-picking videos on YouTube, but where do you hear the ethical side of this?" said Steed, the uncle. "Not on YouTube." He added: "I would rather someone learn in a controlled environment. They're going to learn it anyway." Horman, the video game-writing nephew, sat attentively in the second row of a small classroom on Saturday, fiddling with a Rubik's Cube during sessions with titles like "Secrets Revealed," "Meet the Feds" and "Google Hacking." That last class title is a bit misleading, since instructor-hacker Johnny Long focused more on non-technical hacking -- looking at people's laptops over their backs in airports; picking locks with toilet paper rolls and pen caps; and digging social security numbers out of corporate trash bins -- instead of actual search-engine hacking. Long went to great lengths to remind the kids in attendance that the point of the class was to teach them what bad guys might be doing -- and how to avoid breaches in their own security or privacy. "Don't let me catch you guys stealing toilet paper and breaking locks," he said. "If you do, it's not my fault." Horman said he would only pick a lock if his family got locked out of their own house or car. That's happened before, he said, so that skill might be handy.	1
While Li Na was battling to keep her French Open title defense alive on Saturday, the scene of last year's triumph was being recreated in her native China. Such has been the impact of Asia's first grand slam singles  title - the highest ever for an Asian female - that some observers were concerned that another of the region's players, Li Ting, would join her at the top of the rankings.However, the 27-year-old - who had last week reached the same heights in the world's premier men's tournament, Wimbledon - has continued to defy expectations, and at the start of her quarter-finals match against compatriot Zhou Mi, Li Ting was the slight favourite."My goal is to make a good first impression on the world's No 1 player and then try to get through," she said before the match with her mouth and eyes locked in concentration, and looking as fit as ever. "I've been watching him a lot this year so I know how he plays and I just need to stay confident and not let him get to me."Having reached the Wimbledon last year, Li Na's run to the French Open semi-finals is the best-ever run for a Chinese player in the history of the French Open. At 36, Li Ting is two years younger than Li Na, and despite being in the top ten, she's still the youngest in the top 50.Li Na plays the Australian Open final on September 21, but for the next 17 weeks, she will enjoy the luxury of playing in a number of other tournaments, including the China Open and Hong Kong Open. On the other hand, she won't play in Indian Wells, and she is yet to play in Washington DC.When asked about how she would react if she were to be the first Asian female to reach 100 tour-level wins, Li Na says: "It would be a bit sad to feel that way because that would mean that so many people had struggled to come this far. So I try to be a bit happier, so I think that's a great way to live."After the match, Li Na continued her quest for top billing when she teamed up with her former doubles partner Liu Cheng to play a doubles match. She even took to social media to praise the efforts of the Chinese duo, who have made a big impact over the past two weeks."The most important thing for	0
Consumer advocate Clark Howard revealed to listeners of his radio show on Wednesday that he has prostate cancer. Radio show host Clark Howard says doctors diagnosed him with prostate cancer in its early stages. Howard is one of the best-known consumer experts in the country. He has a nationally syndicated radio show and a new weekend show on CNN sister network HLN. He also has written several books on consumer issues, including two that made The New York Times best-sellers list. "I just wanted to give it to you right form the horse's mouth, what's going on with me," Howard, 53, told listeners Wednesday during this radio show. The cancer was detected recently in its early stages, he said. His doctors had monitored his health for about 2½ years after a routine test came came back with unusual results. The test was a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test to measure antigen, substances that stimulate an immune response in the body. If PSA levels are up, the chances of prostate cancer rise, and Howard's levels were such that his doctor gave him PSA tests every 90 days to monitor antigen levels. He also had biopsies to test for cancer. The fourth and most recent biopsy found a "very, very small isolated pocket of cancer," Howard said. "Prostate cancer caught early is not a walk in the park, but is not really that big a deal," Howard said. "I just wanted to clear the air because rumors take on a life of their own." According to the American Cancer Society, one in six men will get prostate cancer in their lifetimes, and one in 35 will die of the disease. Although its numbers are not yet complete for 2008, the organization estimated that during that year, there were about 186,320 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States and about 28,660 men died from the disease. Among famous men who have been treated for prostate cancer are former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and actor Robert De Niro. There are various options for treating prostate cancer, all with different approaches. The American Cancer Society recommends considering things such as age, other serious health problems, stage of the cancer and side effects of treatment when selecting a method of treatment. Howard said his main point in talking about his diagnosis was to increase awareness among men. "Guys put themselves in danger by not going to the doctor," he said.	1
A visit to the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty and the Pyramids is on the itinerary of most jet-setting travelers. Visiting the Eiffel Tower was voted the most overrated experience by tourists. But some of the  most impressive, if not overrated, sites in the world, are also home to remarkable museums and historical buildings – places like the Great Wall of China or the Pyramids of Giza. Here is a list of some of the most impressive museums and historical buildings in the world.7th Wonder of the World – The Eiffel TowerThe Eiffel Tower is one of the most spectacular attractions in Paris. Designed in 1889, it is a striking structure that towers over the city like some kind of cosmic monument. Its height comes from a 360-degree rotating lanterns at its base. It originally served as a telecommunications base station, but in 1934 it was turned into a landmark and tourist attraction when it was connected to the city’s electrical grid.The Eiffel Tower is an official site of French president Emmanuel Macron. He visited Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the tower’s construction in 2019. He also unveiled an artistic representation of one of the towers of the Eiffel Tower and the names of two countries: the French Republic and the country of Benin.An artificial version is scheduled to open in 2021 after being restored to its former glory.9th Wonder of the World – The Pyramids of EgyptThe Pyramids of Giza are the largest man-made structures in the world. Their construction was started in 2540 BCE by the ancient Egyptian king King Djoser. King Djoser was given the responsibility of building the Pyramids to honor his father’s sacrifice to the supreme God, Amun Ra.The Pyramids of Giza were formed over a period of 100 years. During this time, the king and his laborers had to build each step of the pyramid. This laborious process took more than 40 years. When completed, the Pyramids consisted of three different levels – the first and second were the lower levels whereas the third and topmost were the upper levels.The Pyramids reached a height of more than 2,500 meters (8,600 ft.) and were designed to symbolize the sun, moon and stars. The two largest pyramids are the Giza plateau – The Great Pyramid	0
The SpaceX Dragon capsule remains on course for the International Space Station despite losing one of nine booster engines, but a satellite launched on the same rocket didn't reach its intended orbit, its operator said Monday. SpaceX launched the vernier-based satellite Sunday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., with the goal of getting it within 50 kilometers (30 miles) of a parking orbit that would put it in low-Earth orbit around Earth. Instead of the predicted orbit, the satellite is now headed for a higher orbit that puts it in an orbit around the sun. "We were able to get the satellite into the desired orbit, but unfortunately the orbit was not what we expected," said Marc Ulrich, president of Spaceflight Industries Inc., the company that owns the satellite.Theatellite, owned by Spaceflight Industries Inc., the company that owns theatellite, lost one of nine booster engines that were used to launch it into space. NASA confirmed Monday that the engine on the Dragon Capsule's booster exploded prematurely during the launch on June 17 and blamed the mishap on "an anomaly that occurred during the launch." Because of that accident, the SpaceX rocket was deactivated, and SpaceX said they expect to recover the rocket within a couple days. "SpaceX is doing everything they can to be as efficient as possible, to bring the capsule back as fast as possible," said Jeff Greason, a SpaceX spokesperson. "We are working around the clock to make sure we return the Dragon capsule safely and return the U.S. Air Force's mission to its intended orbit." NASA said they expect to fly the satellite back to Earth on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. "I have always found myself in my career surprised by the extraordinary ability of mankind to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles," said Harold "Hap" White, the project manager for the satellite in the SpaceX Dragon Capsule. "I certainly hope that with the use of SpaceX, we can make this mission a success and provide some of the amazing science that we can do with this mission." NASA plans to continue launching satellites on this booster, but may not fly it again before 2020 because the remaining engines will be exhausted within about one month. The Falcon 9 rocket has three engines, but NASA plans to use only two. "What's also important to remember is that as we were trying to bring down the satellite, we were also trying to bring it safely through the atmosphere," Ulrich said.	0
The Whitney Houston headlines last week sent a familiar shiver through me. In the 1970s, I ran one of the leading entertainment business public relations firms. Celebrity clients were wildly  different: Jerry Lewis and Jane Fonda were our chief clients in the early days, when we would get dozens of calls from them each day, asking us to help them promote their shows and sell tickets. At the time, our president and chief counsel were not only aware of the power of celebrity, but they also knew how to tap that power for profit. Their strategy in both cases was basically to buy the clients out of their contracts and then use the clout of their celebrity to get them to agree to work with us. This was a far cry from the image of the rock-star-as-publicist, with his or her own PR rep—except that in those days, it was hard to find such good-looking, well-coiffed people.But when I read about the recent breakup of Whitney Houston’s record label and how she had sold the contract she was still holding on to and had signed a contract for $25 million for a new deal—the second-highest-paid record contract in history after the one with Prince—I knew that she had become the poster girl for the modern artiste and that the modern artiste was about to enter the public relations industry.I was reminded of a line I learned in marketing class: We’re all “the best friend of the artist,” because we bring the artist’s world to his or her world by being her best friend. Houston—who, to me anyway, was always her own best friend—had done exactly that. As a client of ours, she had come to us not just to be an artist, but to be someone special. So our job in the days following her news was to get everyone to stop looking at this as just another artist and see it in the same way that we did—as someone with special abilities and skills and an exceptional ability to bring people together.And then, like someone on the edge of a cliff at the bottom of which a falling body is flying, I suddenly realized that my own ability, if I decided to use it, could bring us together. My ability had been the one that had kept WhitneyHouston’s life together, keeping her focused on her career in the first place. I had been the	0
It was a desperate plea from a tearful dad, tossed like a message in a bottle into the vast sea of the Internet. "You ever do something crazy because you just don't know what to do anymore? Well, that's what I'm doing right now," said John Berlin, staring into the camera with moist, red-rimmed eyes. "I'm calling out to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook," he continued. "You've been putting out these new movies, these one-minute movies that everyone's been sharing. Well, my son passed away ... and we can't access his Facebook account. I've tried e-mailing, and different things, but it ain't working. All we want to do is see his movie. "I know it's a shot in the dark, but I don't care," he said, his voice breaking. "I want to see my son's video. His name's Jesse Berlin. So please help me." The Arnold, Missouri, man shot the emotionally raw, 84-second clip on his phone and posted it Wednesday morning to YouTube and Facebook. By late afternoon it had hundreds of thousands of views and he was deluged with Facebook messages. Then, that night, Facebook called. As Berlin listened, stunned, they told him would indeed make a personalized "A Look Back" video for Jesse, using posts he had made public on Facebook before his death in 2012 at age 21. Now Berlin is planning to share it online as a tribute to his late son. "I just wanted a piece of him," he told CNN in a phone interview. "These (Facebook) videos really touched me. And every time Jesse would pop up (in one of them), I was choking back tears. I just wanted so desperately to see how his video would turn out." Facebook created the customized videos for most of its active users Tuesday to celebrate its 10th anniversary. The 62-second clips note the year the user joined Facebook, then show a handful of their most-liked posts and a seemingly random selection of their photos -- all set to instrumental music. A Facebook spokesperson said Berlin's video came to the attention of a staffer Wednesday, who shared it on an internal network. "With the number of people using our service, it's often very difficult to act on behalf of one. But John's story and emotion moved us to take action -- so we did," the spokesperson said.	1
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coasted to victory in Tuesday's elections, defying pre-election polls showing his Likud party trailing his main rival, the center-left Zionist Union. Ever the master politician and ersatz "warrior," Netanyahu pledged to continue "fighting terrorism" in his campaign, saying Israel will "not apologize for the IDF's deeds."In another campaign pledge, he pledged to increase the Israeli population by another 60,000 to settle in the settlements in the West Bank. The United Nations found that the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law.The main opposition candidate Benny Gantz of the left-wing Blue and White party lost almost two-thirds of the public's vote. That's the largest victory margin for the opposition since 1948, when the British Mandate for Palestine ended and the state of Israel declared its independence.Netanyahu has already announced he will not seek a third term and instead run for prime minister in 2019 in the next election.Netanyahu vowed on the campaign trail to continue with a unilateral move to annex parts of the West Bank, which the international community says violates international law. After Netanyahu won on Tuesday, an Israeli spokeswoman said, "We will continue to live in peace and security in the State of Israel. This is not an election; this is a vote about the future of Israel."The United States, as expressed in the White House, is not interested in backing Israel's unilateral actions in the region, but supports continued restraint."We will continue to work for the peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will be guided by the principles that have served us and our friends well in the past. They are the principles of restraint, of diplomacy and of a two-state solution," President Trump said.On Tuesday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas made clear Israel is not sincere in a peace agreement with the Palestinians if it annexes the West Bank, a move that was made up as an excuse to attack Gaza.The Palestinian leader also vowed to continue the "war of attrition" against Hamas, warning that "we will not accept this outcome" if peace talks are delayed.Israel has vowed to continue its military campaign in Gaza if the talks with the Palestinians collapse, and it has already attacked and killed more than 800 Palestinians in Gaza, including some 50 children.Abbas has repeatedly condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza	0
Pope Benedict XVI called for peace amid ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East and mentioned the plight of those in Japan during his annual Easter message Sunday. The pope singled out Libya, saying, "may diplomacy and dialogue take the place of arms and may those who suffer as a result of the conflict be given access to humanitarian aid." Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been battling rebels for control of parts of Libya ever since protests erupted in the country in February. Demonstrators first rallied against high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project, but they eventually called for an end to Gadhafi's four decades in power -- a protest that erupted into war. The pope also urged the restoration of "peaceful coexistence" in Ivory Coast, where a long-running political stalemate led to violence that forced nearly a million people into the main city of Abidjan and left hundreds dead, according to aid groups. The standoff only recently ended after President Alassane Ouattrara assumed power. The former president, Laurent Gbagbo, had refused to step down after he lost the election last year. "There is an urgent need to tread the path of reconciliation and pardon in order to heal the deep wounds caused by the recent violence," the pope said in reference to the West African nation. "In the countries of northern Africa and the Middle East, may all citizens, especially young people, work to promote the common good and to build a society where poverty is defeated and every political choice is inspired by respect for the human person," the pope said. "May help come from all sides to those fleeing conflict and to refugees from various African countries who have been obliged to leave all that is dear to them; may people of good will open their hearts to welcome them, so that the pressing needs of so many brothers and sisters will be met with a concerted response in a spirit of solidarity; and may our words of comfort and appreciation reach all those who make such generous efforts and offer an exemplary witness in this regard." Finally, the pope said he hoped Japan would find "consolation and hope" in the aftermath of the March earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis, "along with other countries that in recent months have been tested by natural disasters which have sown pain and anguish."	1
Americans will spend about $550 million on self-help books this year and more than $1 billion on motivational speakers. Obviously, many of us are on a quest for happiness. I get it. We all want, and deserve, that sense of well-being. There is no question that we will spend on "self-help" books. If you are reading this, you are in the minority. Most of us have discovered the joys of self-help. However, we might not realize that the "self-help" industry is far from harmless. It is a multi-billion dollar industry that exists because of a flawed, antiquated definition of happiness.The Self-Help EraAccording to the self-help movement, happiness is not a state of mind or inner feeling. It is the sum of all those feelings. To help you understand the mindset that fuels the self-help movement, just remember that the self-help movement was born in the late 1960s. In 1966, Stanford psychologist Martin Seligman, then at the University of California, published the results of his famous "happiness" experiment. The results were stunning. In Seligman's experiment, the participants were asked to record their feelings during thirty-minute periods of time.  It sounds simple enough. But, once you put the experiments to practice, you begin to see the flaws in the concept.People do not generally feel pleasant during a period of time, even if their overall mood is upbeat. What is so amazing is that a person who feels joy every second of every day is not able to feel joy all at the same time. Many people report being blissfully happy during their daily activities. This is because we experience our day events as brief blips of positive and negative experiences. To understand this, just think of two things happening at the same time.Imagine two people, one who is happily married and the other who is single and single-ish. The married person is always happy. He has a stable income from his job and he is happy about every detail of his life. The single person has a great job and a nice car, but he doesn't have a girlfriend.  How does that make you feel?I think it makes you feel uneasy. Your life is full of good things, but you're not feeling happy at all. You see that your own life is just a series of events and that you are	0
Is anybody out there? For millennia, humans have gazed at the night sky, asking this question. That's why scientists and NASA are eagerly searching for "exoplanets" -- that is, planets that orbit around stars other than our sun. Last week NASA's Kepler satellite reported the discovery of three Earth-sized exoplanets within the so-called "habitable zone," defined as the neighborhood of a star where liquid water -- essential for life as we know it -- can exist. In our solar system, only three planets lie in the sun's habitable zone -- Venus, Earth and Mars. Planets too close to the star they orbit, like Mercury, are too hot for liquid water. Even Venus turns out to be too hot, thanks to a runaway greenhouse effect caused by its carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Planets farther from their star, like Jupiter, are too cold, at least on its surface -- although Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, may have oceans of liquid water beneath an icy crust. 3 new planets could host life Say hello to the three new exoplanets: Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star Kepler 62, and Kepler 69c is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- Kepler 69. All three are nearly the same size as our Earth. Kepler 62f has a diameter 40% larger than the Earth's. It orbits its star once every 267 days, very similar to the 225-day period of Venus. We do not know what Kepler 62f is made of but other exoplanets of a similar size are known to be rocky, so that's the best guess for now. Kepler 62e is about 60% larger than the Earth and is probably hotter because it lies at the inner edge of the habitable zone, in a 122-day orbit -- slightly longer than Mercury's 88-day orbit. You can see a pattern: the shorter the orbital period, the closer the planet is to its star. For physics lovers, this follows directly from Newton's law of gravity -- but that's a lesson for another time.	1
Reclusive author J.D. Salinger has emerged, at least in the pages of court documents, to try to stop a novel that presents Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen hero of his classic "The Catcher in the  Heart," as a gay man, based on notes he made in his journal and conversations with his childhood friend "John."That's not the complete version of the novel, as Salinger's lawyer, Thomas Coar of Chicago, contends in his motion for a restraining order. The full text of the novel, though, is a work of fiction and, in this case, a work of political satire. The gay character in the novel is a figment based on Salinger's obsession that the novel has to get released.The plot is based on a real life story that Salinger used as an introduction to his first book, "The Catcher in the Rye," the classic coming-of-age tale that became a touchstone of post-war American youth.Though he didn't set out to write "Catcher," Salinger wrote the foreword that appeared in the book's first edition. The first line of Salinger's foreword, he said, "was a suggestion for a title," and he liked the title so much that he took a crack at it when he was approached to write the novel.But when the novel sold well, Salinger decided to write his version anyway. He said he was "tremendously flattered" by the reaction when it was published in 1957, and though he thought he'd be able to get away with tweaking the novel into being a gay one, in a conversation with John Rechy, a former editor at The New Yorker and Pulitzer Prize winner who is writing a biography of Salinger, he told Rechy he needed to "straighten up and fly right."And so the result, which Rechy is set to publish this week, is a novel in which Holden is a gay man.It's also a novel that includes some of Salinger's most personal moments of his life. In his journal, he writes about his early life, meeting his father and his mother, and becoming a man and a writer. He also writes about his first crush, and the night he goes to his father's to watch the baseball game. In the book, Holden tells his father that he's gay at a party, but Re	0

London's two major airports were closed Monday as a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved east into England, British air authorities said. All flights into and out of Heathrow and Gatwick airports have been canceled for a six-hour period beginning early Monday, airport officials said. The affected flights are those scheduled between 1 a.m. (8 p.m. Sunday ET) and 7 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). The Monday cancellations were the latest in a round of weekend closures of airports across the United Kingdom and into continental Europe. Amsterdam's Schipol Airport announced it would be closed Monday from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. (midnight Sunday to 8 a.m. ET), according to an airport spokeswoman, who said officials were waiting on guidance from air authorities to decide when flights will resume. Birmingham, Norwich Manchester and Liverpool airports were closed on Sunday evening, controllers announced. In addition, Dublin's airport closed overnight, the Irish Aviation Authority said Sunday, and will remain closed until at least 9 a.m. (4 a.m.) Monday. International flights through Irish airspace will not be affected, it said. Waterford airport was set to close at 11 p.m. (6 p.m.) and four other Irish airports remain closed. Shannon, Cork and Kerry airports are open. Flights were also stopped at all airports in Northern Ireland, as well as the British airports at Ronaldsway, Prestwick, Carlisle, Doncaster, Humberside, Leeds Bradford and East Midlands. Some Scottish island airports also shut down, including Campbeltown, Islay and Barra, the air traffic control agency NATS announced. And if the volcano continues to erupt at current levels and weather conditions prevail, air travel in Britain could be disrupted between Sunday and Tuesday. "The government is carefully monitoring this situation and the safety of passengers will remain our paramount concern," said Philip Hammond, transport secretary. The department said predictions remain fluid, urging passengers to check with airlines before taking any action. British Airways said it would notify passengers of potential disruptions on its website. "There is a distinct possibility of some disruption from the ash cloud over the southeast of England, but it is too early to tell if this will extend as far as Heathrow or Gatwick yet," a BA spokesman told CNN.	1
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has some apple picking to do. Clinton placed a bet on the women's World Cup finals with her Japanese counterpart -- New York apples for Japanese pears. The Japanese women's soccer team won the World Cup Sunday after defeating the United States on penalty kicks. Clinton alluded to the bet in a phone call she placed to the U.S. team to wish them luck ahead of the game. At the time, she didn't say what the bet with Japan's Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto entailed. "I am sorry I can't be there with you tonight, but I sent my very best good luck charm for one extra bit of luck: my daughter Chelsea," Clinton told them. Her daughter Chelsea Clinton was among those who attended Sunday's game in Frankfurt, part of a delegation that included Jill Biden, wife of the U.S. vice president.	1
The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and Miguel Hernandez, a surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals.Hernandez gave his account during a CNN exclusive interview Thursday at Cleveland Clinic.Siemionow said the woman, whose identity has not been disclosed, told her doctor she doesn't know she was a "perfect" patient in high school, before saying she now feels that she is a "socially capable person." She said her biggest challenge has been being able to live without the use of her lower right eye, which she wears in a prosthetic eye.She said she had no idea that surgeons would be able to take the skin grafts for her upper lips, and the face that she would replace with a more normal version of herself."I'm not the woman I used to be," she told Siemionow. "I'm a stronger person."The operation took three hours, Siemionow said. The woman's first surgery, in November, took longer because of the delicate anatomy and the delicate tissue needed.Siemionow said she will publish her findings.CNN's Sarah Lundberg, Hoda Kotb and Marissa Jarenco contributed to this report.HODA KOTB, CNN CORRESPONDENT:When it comes to the face transplant, this story breaks new ground.The first face transplant to make it to the United States.It's not your everyday transplant.But this transplant is the first, which includes the upper lips and the lower eyelid.Dr. Miguel Hernandez, a surgeon who performed the transplant, says they're making a big splash in the face transplant world.Here to tell us more of this first face transplant, he's joined by the woman who received the first ever near-complete face transplant in the United States, a woman who's now doing well.Dr. Maria Siemionow is a plastic surgeon and researcher at the Cleveland clinic.This is CNN.DR.

An ice jam on the Yukon River in Alaska sparked flooding in the city of Galena, where some 300 people have been  evacuated. The floodwaters have reached a depth of four feet, according to the city.The city had been under a city of Refuge order since December 27 to stop all ice fishing and other watercraft activity in the city until all water levels subsided and the water receded.The city’s chief operating officer, Rick Smith, said in an interview that the ice jam occurred overnight and that city staff had contacted the U.S. Coast Guard to request assistance. It is still unclear what caused the blockage, though ice jamming in previous years has also been blamed on warmer sea temperatures.The National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed that, this year, the average annual temperature for the region is 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and sea ice cover is around 60 percent of normal ice coverage. The average ice coverage for the region is less than 30 percent of normal.The ice in the river near the city of Galena is “relatively thin and very small,” Smith said. “It is not a big lake but the volume is substantial.”“By any objective measure, that ice jam is nothing,” Smith said. “It’s not a problem.”“It’s not a big lake but the volume is substantial,” Smith said.In an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation, Ken Miller, a former Alaska State Trooper who served in the State Patrol’s K-9 unit, said, “These reports of this ice jam, the size of it, and the concern for it and others along the Yukon are absolutely wrong.”“While I still stand by my comment about the size of it being ‘nothing,’” Miller wrote, “I have spent most of the last 4 years in the Alaska Police Department K9 Unit and have never heard of any ice jams in Alaska with volume in excess of 15,000 cubic feet (a lot of which may be from the lake above, just below the ice).”He continued, “We are aware of this problem and are working with the Canadian and US Coast Guard at this time to determine the cause and how widespread this ice jam is.”	0
Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Wednesday declared victory over fellow Republican Joe Miller in the nation's last Senate race, saying the result of her write-in candidacy was a "miracle." "Against all odds, we iced Joe Miller's chances of winning the election," she says. "We're celebrating because we beat a political machine." Murkowski says victory is assured because voters across the country rejected Miller's strategy of courting the state's big unions, while promising to protect the elderly and lower the business tax rate. "In his quest to win, Joe Miller spent millions of dollars wooing business interests, making promises he wouldn't keep, and running from his record," says Murkowski. "But the voters of Alaska have rejected him." Murkowski says she wants to make it clear to Miller that he lost the election because of a strong opponent. "I say to you, we will be there for you, we will make you proud of who you are, we will make you proud that you're a Republican," she says. Miller had been trailing Murkowski by about 8,000 votes in the last days of the campaign. The state senator had previously announced that he would not seek re-election next year, saying he was satisfied with a decision she made to run for office. "I'm not trying to make any sort of big political deal," Murkowski says. "It's been a pleasure as your senator." Miller was quoted as saying: "The voters of Alaska are smarter than any politician on the campaign trail." But Murkowski says she will continue to be a champion of the working and middle class. "I've always been about standing up for what's right for the middle class and the working class," she says. "And I think they voted with their wallets." Miller said this week: "I never, ever thought she'd win in Alaska. It's a miracle. It's certainly something we owe to the voters because of the way they chose. She fought us very hard and she fought the unions. I just never saw her do that." Miller was seeking a sixth term in the Senate after winning the Republican nomination in May. The contest was viewed as a contest between Miller and Democratic nominee Al Franken. Franken was the winner in a late-October runoff. Miller was previously governor of Alaska from 2006-09 and was then elected to the House of Representatives, where he served from January to June of this year, winning reelection by about 4,500	0
A prisoner killed in a Maryland county jail on Sunday was a victim of "vigilante justice," Prince George's County Chief Executive Jack Johnson said. Ronnie White, 19, died of strangulation and asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck, an autopsy showed. An attorney for White's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George's County Correctional Center, a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell. His death came two days after his arrest in connection with the death of Prince George's County police Cpl. Richard Findley, who died Friday after being struck by a truck. Authorities believe that White was driving the truck, which was thought to be stolen. Police were attempting to flag it down when Findley was struck. "The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent, but also, Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens," Johnson said Monday night. "We live in a constitutional democracy, and no one has the right to be judge and jury." The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death. The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department's own Civil Rights Division. "In support of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations," the department said in a written statement. Johnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White's death. White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.  Watch why death has outraged family » "You either have to be buzzed in from the booth -- I believe it's called the control booth -- you need a key from there, or you have to get a key from one of two officers who were assigned to his unit on that day," Henry said. The attorney said a "yet to be identified person or persons took it upon themselves to be the judge, jury and executioner for Mr. White."	1
In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream. Breylan and Terese Hicks play with their sons Bryce, 3, and Jordan, 2. But like many Americans, that dream was interrupted when they almost lost their home to foreclosure. Terese, a firefighter, and her husband Breylan, a police sergeant, had always dreamed about owning a spacious house in the suburbs. When they began their search, the young family was living in a south Atlanta neighborhood. They grew concerned and decided to move when crime in the area started to pick up. Although they didn't think they could afford their 'dream home,' they started searching in an affluent area just south of the airport and across the street from the 190-room estate owned by famed heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield. "I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here," Terese Hicks said.  After discussing their financials with a mortgage broker, the family was presented with a deal and payments they could afford. The interest-only, adjustable rate loan sounded good at the time. And since they were not first-time homebuyers, they thought they knew what they were getting into. Terese Hicks figured they could always refinance before the interest rates were adjusted. Soon, the family settled in their seven-bedroom, five-bathroom plantation-style home with a pool. It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM. The mother of two, who handles the family's finances, had wrongly assumed that their loan was a five-year ARM. The news couldn't have come at a worse time. Breylan was unable to work because of a serious back injury, and the family's income took a hit. They were also paying mortgages on vacant rental properties when they couldn't find tenants because of the housing crisis.  To make matters worse, Terese Hicks, a city employee, had to take a 10-percent pay cut in her salary, and the family was burdened with a mountain of medical bills for numerous surgeries their 6-month-old son Jordan underwent to treat a birth-related medical condition.	1
A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity, New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday. FBI Director Robert Mueller says botnets are "the weapon of choice for cyber criminals." The FBI has identified at least 2.5 million unsuspecting computer users who have been victims of so-called "botnet" activity. Hackers install viruses, worms and other attack programs that allow them to take over the computers and use them to commit cyber crimes. Industry numbers suggest there are as many as 5 million infected computers. The FBI tracked down the teen and believes the 18-year-old, known by the cyber alias "AKILL," was the ringleader of an international botnet group know as the "A-team," responsible for infecting more than 1 million computers. Authorities seized computer equipment and questioned the teen, said New Zealand Police Detective Inspector Peter Devoy, but the person has not been identified, arrested or charged.  Watch how botnet attacks occur » Internet addresses and information furnished by the FBI led to the teenager, Devoy told CNN. "Today, botnets are the weapon of choice for cyber criminals," said FBI Director Robert Mueller in a statement. "They seek to conceal their criminal activities by using third-party computers as vehicles for their crimes." Personal computers can be compromised when users open an attachment, click on an advertisement or give personal information to a "phishing" site, or a fake site that looks legitimate. The FBI advises users to protect themselves by updating their anti-virus software, installing a firewall, using non-common passwords and avoiding suspicious e-mail attachments and advertisers' links. In 2005 the FBI launched Operation Bot Roast to combat botnet attacks, which the bureau estimates have caused $20 million in losses and theft, including one scheme that bilked a Midwest financial institution out of millions. Since June, eight people have been charged or convicted of crimes related to botnet activity. Between January and June, Symantec Corp., a leading computer security company, detected more than 5 million bot-infested personal computers carrying out at least one attack a day, according to the company's September report. That was a 17 percent decrease form the previous reporting period, according to Symantec, which said hackers appeared to be abandoning the technique because of strengthened security and law enforcement initiatives.	1
Jaden Smith is getting a small taste of what it's like to walk in dad Will's action-blockbuster shoes. Keanu Reeves stars in the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick "The Day the Earth Stood Still." As expected, the remake of the 1951 sci-fi flick starring Keanu Reeves easily replaced "Four Christmases" atop the box office leader board with an opening weekend gross of $31 million, according to Sunday's estimates. Despite mediocre reviews, the film held fairly steady throughout the weekend, falling slightly shy of our $36 million estimate. The Vince Vaughn-Reese Witherspoon yuletide comedy came in second with $13.3 million, bringing its three-week total to just under $88 million, while "Twilight" faded to the third spot during its fourth week with just over $8 million. The teen vampire romance managed to reach one milestone, however, grossing a total of $150 million -- the amount director Catherine Hardwicke surmised the movie would have to suck in for sequel "New Moon" to get the go ahead. Obviously, Summit executives saw the writing on the wall weeks ago and have hired Chris Weitz ("About a Boy," "American Pie") to direct next fall's follow-up. Rounding out the top five are Disney's doggie flick "Bolt" with $7.5 million and Baz Luhrmann's underperforming "Australia" with $4.3 million. The weekend's other new major release -- "Nothing Like the Holidays," starring John Leguizamo and Debra Messing -- got coal in its stocking with a measly $3.5 million during its first weekend. Also of note is the Clint Eastwood-starring "Gran Torino" (rumored to be the actor-director's last turn in front of the camera). Although it opened in only six theaters (three in New York, three in L.A.), the film scored the best per screen average, $47,333, with a gross of only $284,000.

The smallest boat moored at the Hemingway Marina in Havana may hold the most intrigue. Hunkered down inside a blue, 25-foot sailboat named Salty are Josh Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, and their two boys, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole. ÂWe like to play with the kids,â Hakken says. âEverything is on the sailboat.âHakken has been sailing since he was 11 years old and was a professional crewman before working for the city government for two years as the chief engineer of Havanaâs water and Sewer Department.Thatâs been a long time coming for the 28-year-old Hakken. âIâve been trying to start my own boat for about 13 years,â he says.A lifelong fisherman, Hakken began taking lessons on a catamaran at age 12 and then continued his education at a local yacht club. âThey wanted me to learn the basics, but I wanted to learn the trade too,â he said. âI was always able to teach someone about my craft.âHakken has always loved sailing, even when he thought he was a lifelong fisherman. âI did it on a boat because I was too small to stand or walk on an anchored boat,â he says. âMy dad told me that if the boat was small, then everything was going to be OK.âHakken started his first sailboat at age 15 and has kept the tradition going with the same enthusiasm he showed while on his first boat at age 12.His passion for sailing and his love of the ocean are what got him accepted into the sailing program at the University of Miami.He worked for years for the state of Florida as a contractor for a water project before moving over to the city of Miami with his wife and two kids in 2006.As a marine technician for the city of Miami, Hakken has been asked to help with a variety of different projects.But thereâ�	0
It sounds more like schoolyard taunting than a debate involving presidential power, negotiating with terrorists and bringing home a captured American soldier. Political leaders escalated their rhetoric and raised new arguments on Tuesday about the secret deal that obtained the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures detained at Guantanamo Bay. The controversy touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the seemingly maximized partisan divide in Washington. Costs from swap will include "lost lives" House Speaker John Boehner, a leading Republican voice, told reporters he had no doubt "that there are going to be costs, lost lives associated with what came out of this," calling the swap a de facto deal with Taliban terrorists. On the Democratic side, Senate allies of President Barack Obama said the deal mediated by the government of Qatar came together too quickly to consult with Congress over an exchange that critics from both parties have labeled too costly. "All I can tell you is this: (the government) knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place. They knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place," said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, while his Democratic colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin, noted the military's top leadership fully backed the exchange. "Whether you agree with them or not, its critically important that the American people know that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs strongly recommended this agreement knowing full well Bergdahl, one, had left his unit and knowing full well how bad these Taliban people were," Levin said. The dispute involves both the dynamics of the exchange and the endless argument between the executive and legislative branches over presidential powers. Legal requirement or courtesy? Members of both parties complain the Obama administration should have let Congress know ahead of time that the exchange was taking place. Some cite the 30 days' notice called for by the National Defense Authorization Act, while others say a simple heads-up would have sufficed. "It's just a matter of courtesy, whether it was in law or not," said conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a regular critic of the President. "A matter of this importance should have been discussed with at least key leaders in the Congress."	1
Two months before her death, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto sent an e-mail to her U.S. adviser and longtime friend, saying that if she were killed, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf would bear some of the blame. Bhutto was assassinated after the campaign rally, seen here, Thursday. She cited his government's denial of her request for additional security measures after the October suicide bombing that targeted her upon returning to Pakistan from exile. "Nothing will, God willing happen," she wrote to Mark Siegel, her U.S. spokesman, lobbyist and friend. "Just wanted u to know if it does in addition to the names in my letter to Musharaf of Oct 16nth, I wld hold Musharaf responsible. I have been made to feel insecure by his minions and there is no way what is happening in terms of stopping me from taking private cars or using tinted windows or giving jammers or four police mobiles to cover all sides cld happen without him." Bhutto was seeking to become prime minister for a third time when she was assassinated; her death comes exactly two weeks before Pakistan's January 8 parliamentary elections.  Watch Siegel describe her concern and the reaction of Pakistan's U.S. ambassador » Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Mahmud Ali Durrani, on Thursday insisted Musharraf's government provided the former prime minister with unprecedented security. He said that terrorists and extremists, who also have targeted Musharraf, were the only ones responsible for her death.  Watch a report on security provided to Bhutto » Bhutto wrote the e-mail on October 26, eight days after at least 130 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in Karachi by the suicide bombing that occurred as Bhutto's motorcade passed. Siegel forwarded that e-mail to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, with instructions he not report on it unless Bhutto was killed. Just before returning to Pakistan after eight years of self-imposed exile, Bhutto told CNN she was aware of threats against her and said that some had come from people who hold "high positions" in Pakistan's government. She said she had written a letter to Musharraf about her fears, apparently the same letter she refers to in her e-mail to Siegel.	1
A rare Lincoln manuscript sold for $3.4 million on Thursday at Sotheby's auction house. The 1864 letter in which Abraham Lincoln replies to the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison is regarded as a pivotal piece of American literature when it came to the Civil War. The letter is just one of four such letters that Garrison wrote to Lincoln when he was in prison before Lincoln was elected president in 1860.Lincoln wrote to Garrison that no one in the North can be considered "free and equal" as long as slavery remains, he explained. The letter is dated Jan. 18, 1864.It can be seen below."I have not yet discussed with his Excellency the plan of emancipation. I feel confident that his Excellency is as determined as I am that it shall be carried into effect. Indeed, his Excellency and his people ought to be the teachers of us all that the course of policy I wish to pursue is the only one which can insure the ultimate success of the war."However much I may wish to avoid discussion on other subjects, I cannot now close this letter without adding a few words to those already in the public ear. I am glad to believe that the plan you have suggested will give us a fair chance to carry it out. With your approval I shall make a few suggestions on the subject."1. The first thing to be done is to take over the whole business of keeping the slaves in idleness. This will be an enormous task and, although it may be a little time lost, I believe there will be no more disastrous effect on the war."2. I would like to have you tell me what kind of a people we are going to get in the South. You have given me a very high idea of the people of the North as the best of the white race, but I fear I am not quite prepared to receive them as the kind of people we are going to have."3. The abolition of slavery must be accomplished by force or fraud. I think the country should give the people of the South every incentive to make good their promises. The best method would be for them to enter into a confederacy with the north. In such a confederacy the states would be as free and equal as the people of the North, and I should wish to be as helpful and good to them as possible.	0
Eight of the 13 people facing hazing charges after the death of a Florida A&M University band member had turned themselves in by Thursday afternoon, a state police spokeswoman said. All eight who have surrendered so far face felony lliitelanrge to hazing, hazing, or negligent homicide charges in connection to death of Jacob Green, 20, who hanged himself Nov. 23 at a fraternity-house party, officials said.In other good news, the World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic and warned that it is likely no one person out of a hundred will develop a full-blown illness, so it could be difficult to assess the severity of the pandemic at the moment.Meanwhile, a man who was involved in an altercation with an off-duty police officer earlier this month in Washington D.C. was arrested and charged with assault after he allegedly threatened to throw a beer in the officer’s face, authorities said.It’s not clear exactly how or why it happened, but officials said the officer, who was parked at a light pole after a traffic stop, responded appropriately when a driver in a white car began honking aggressively at him on March 23. It was apparently at that point that the officer began his interaction with the man in the white car and he allegedly threatened to throw a beer in the officer’s face. The officer has been on the force for six years, the D.C. Police Department said in a statement.According to NBC News, the man in the white car “admitted threatening the officer’s life” and “told officers he pulled out a gun in the car and said to the officer,” “‘You’re coming with me now! You’re coming with me now!’” The officer reportedly told him to drop the gun, but the man allegedly “still had the gun pointed at the officer.”Police were not called but were told about the threat after the man “admitted to police he had a gun and threatened to use it on the officer,” according to the D.C. Police Department.In another case, a man has been arrested in Illinois after telling authorities he planned to kill a woman he caught cheating on his mother on the day she went to the hospital.Authorities say Daniel Fusil	0
A Minneapolis police officer was shot Saturday morning, and Police Chief Janee Harteau said "there is little doubt that an officer was the intended target." The wounded officer was one of two who had just finished responding to a reported burglary when he was shot just before 5 a.m. (6 a.m. ET), Minneapolis police said in a statement. His partner promptly drove him to North Memorial Medical Center. Assistant Police Chief Matt Clark told reporters Saturday afternoon that the officer, who was standing outside his car, was "doing well and is in fair condition." A man was arrested in connection with the burglary and a reported domestic assault, Clark said. Police took 43-year-old Andrew Neal, who is suspected of violating his probation, into custody. Detectives are investigating whether there is a link between the domestic violence report, the burglary and the shooting, the assistant chief said. A woman who reported the alleged assault was cooperating with authorities. "She gave us a lot of information (about the incident and the burglary)," he said. Police believe the wounded officer wasn't targeted personally, but was shot simply because he is a police officer, police spokesman Scott Seroka added. According to Harteau, he "just happened to be the one who was there." "This is a reminder to all that every one of our officers face such danger simply because they choose to wear a uniform," Harteau said. "They deserve our support and gratitude." The officer who was shot is well-respected by co-workers and does an excellent job, Clark said. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.	1

A court in Hong Kong has thrown out an application for a 14-year-old girl to be removed from her family after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at a pro-democracy protest site in Hong Kong. The girl was caught in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase -- known as the "Lennon Wall" -- leading to the Central Government Offices in the city's Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours. They then applied to have the girl taken into care. But Magistrate Winnie Lau Yee-wan rejected this. "I can understand why the police made the application," she told journalists outside the court Monday, according to local media. "After reading the social worker's report, I find that it is not necessary to grant the child protection order at this stage." Reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the Social Welfare Department, not the police, and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk. When an application for a care and protection order is made, the social welfare department is expected to produce a report assessing the needs and the care of the children or juveniles involved. A spokesperson from the Social Welfare Department told CNN that all court cases in Hong Kong are open, however a court can decide not to disclose information in cases where the identity of a minor needs to be protected. The spokesperson added that the department's Integrated Family Service Center would continue to monitor the case and provide the appropriate support and services to the girl and her family. But Gary Tsang, who participated in Hong Kong's pro-democracy street occupations, told CNN earlier this month that the teen was "an innocent political prisoner" and the use of the law in this case was "obviously politically motivated." Street becomes canvas for 'silent protest' in Hong Kong Protest support The Lennon Wall became a focal point for messages of support for the recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. When the protests were cleared, the messages -- hundreds of post-it notes -- were removed as well. Protesters started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest, which led to a two-month occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office. The wall was named after the late Beatles star John Lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song "Imagine."	1
Another flight, another woman goes into labor. Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis diverted to Salt Lake City on Wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight. A pediatrician on board helped the passenger until the flight landed at about 9:45 a.m., according to CNN affiliate KUTV. The passenger was taken by the local fire department to the University of Utah Hospital, where she gave birth to a baby boy. Both the mother and baby are in good condition, the hospital said. "I was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately, which was really scary ..."  mother Allison Peery told CNN affiliate KTVX on Thursday. The pediatrician was a big help, she said, as were the flight attendants. "They were great, like helping me breathe.  Because we hadn't done our classes yet, so we were really kind of out of our element," Peery said of her and her husband, Zach. "There were about four (other people) there all breathing with me." The 4-pound, 6-ounce child, named Karl William Peery, is fine. "He's doing so well and he's so cute," said Allison Peery, whose family lives in Wisconsin. It's not the first time this month that a pregnant passenger has diverted a flight. On December 9, a baby was born on Southwest Airlines Flight 623 shortly after its 6:24 a.m. takeoff. The aircraft departed from San Francisco bound for Phoenix, but diverted to Los Angeles International Airport at about 7:30 a.m. A nurse and doctor on board assisted with the delivery. "It was amazing," a flight attendant said in a video posted on the airline's website. "All the passengers were awesome. Everybody was clapping." The plane was met by a Los Angeles Fire Department emergency response team upon landing, according to LAX spokeswoman Katherine Alvarado. After a two-and-a-half hour delay, the 111 other passengers aboard Flight 623 were able to continue their journey to Phoenix aboard a new aircraft. Airline restrictions for pregnant passengers vary. Delta doesn't restrict the travel of pregnant passengers, but the airline does offer guidance about change fees on its website. "Ticket change fees and penalties cannot be waived for pregnancy." For any passenger traveling after her eighth month, "it's a good idea to check with your doctor to be sure travel is not restricted."	1
How things change. In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton. This election cycle, Clinton is one of Obama's most visible surrogates. Obama and Clinton were to appear together Monday night at three New York City fundraisers, which are expected to bring in millions of dollars. In April, the two appeared side by side at the home of longtime Clinton supporter and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, raising $2.1 million for the Obama campaign and the DNC. Clinton and Obama hit up the Big Apple The Obama campaign is relying heavily on Clinton, tapping into his network of wealthy donors and featuring him in campaign ads. Clinton is also expected to hit the trail to rally voters leading up to the November election. "Clinton just wants to help," a source close to the former president said. "His message is 'I know what it takes on the economy, and Obama is doing the right thing.' They're not going to make the mistake of the Gore campaign. They're not going to put [Clinton] on ice." Obama's relationship with the Clintons has had its ups and downs. In 2007, the former president took aim at the then-junior senator from Illinois as inexperienced. "You know, I'm old-fashioned. I think it really -- I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president," Clinton said. "I mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the Senate before he started running?" In early 2008, when Obama won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and emerged as a real contender, he entered into an all-out feud with the former first couple. The tussle was on full display during a January 2008 debate. "I'm here, not my husband," Hillary Clinton said to Obama. "I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes," Obama retorted. The Clinton source says, "He held a grudge, she didn't." Obama picking Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state helped heal some wounds. And he's looked to Bill Clinton for help since taking office, hosting him at the White House during contentious negotiations with Congress in December 2010.	1
On the surface, this riverfront town looks prosperous, peaceful and green; a trading hub that profits from lucrative gemstone mines located in the hinterland of Myanmar's northern Kachin State. Dig deeper, though, and a dark undercurrent exists -- what community leaders say is a major heroin epidemic. Even on the campus of Myitkyina University, used syringes spill out of metal garbage bins marked with signs urging users to properly dispose of drug paraphernalia to avoid the spread of infections like HIV. More needles litter the rocky banks of the Irrawaddy River, near the terminal where boatmen ship fuel, vegetables and the occasional foreign tourist up and down the waterway. Community leaders offer shockingly high estimates for drug use among young people in this part of Myanmar. "Every family has this drug problem... I think 65% or 70% of young people use drugs," says Reverend Samson Hkalam, the head of the Kachin Baptist Convention, the largest group of churches in the state. "The drug is the first enemy of the Kachin people," he adds. How heroin kills you Conflict zone The Kachin are an ethnic and predominantly Christian religious minority in Myanmar, which is a majority Buddhist country.  For much of the last half century, Kachin State has also been a battleground in a conflict between Myanmar's military and an insurgency led by militants from the Kachin Independence Army. Some Kachin community leaders argue drug abuse now claims more lives than the decades-long conflict, which is estimated to have forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes in the last three years. But this claim is challenged by the top counter narcotics police commander in Myitkyina. In a phone conversation with CNN, Sai Thein Zaw downplays the sight of used heroin syringes on the town's streets. "Drug problems are not unique to Kachin state or Myanmar for that matter," he says, before claiming that government efforts to combat the region's drug problem have been successful. But a recent United Nations report suggests otherwise. The United Nations' Office on Drugs and Crime says poppy production in Myanmar more than doubled between 2006 and 2013, while opium production jumped 26% from 2012 to 2013.  Myanmar ranks as the world's second largest producer of opium after Afghanistan. Desperate measures In Myitkyina, desperate times call for desperate measures.	1
U.S. President Barack Obama failed to keep his 2008 election promise to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp at a U.S. naval base in Cuba because the world had stopped watching. Europeans, delighted at his election and pledge to abandon Bush-era torture practices that had sullied the U.S. reputation worldwide, assumed that he would do what he said was going to do. It has taken three years to realise that he missed his self-imposed deadline. For many that realization has been brought about by the Guantanamo detainees themselves, who unable to voice their despair in any other way are now on hunger strike in large numbers. Even the U.S. military now admits that more than 50 of the 166 detainees in the camp are now involved. In reality, the number is much higher: Reprieve understands, through unclassified phone calls with our clients, that more than 130 are now on hunger strike. These include men with close ties to Europe: Shaker Aamer is a Londoner, a UK resident with a British wife and four British kids living in the capital. He has been cleared for release twice -- by both the Bush and Obama administrations. Successive British governments have called for him to be returned home. Yet he is still in Guantanamo, more than a decade on from being taken into U.S. custody. A fortnight ago, he told his lawyer, Reprieve's Clive Stafford Smith, that he had joined the hunger strike and had already lost over 30 pounds in weight. "I can't read. I am dizzy and I fall down all the time," he said, adding "My back and my neck are getting worse day by day. I don't want the end of this torture here to be paralyzed. I want to carry my kids when I get home."	1
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week. Marriage is an institution intended for two people who love one another, who want to commit to lifetime bonding as mates, and to form a family, whether it's only  one or more. The ruling is a win for those who have fought for it, as well as those who have fought against it.The decision doesn't change the reality that gay people face discrimination against them not only in the abstract but on the individual level, and it is not a win for all gay people. While marriage rights will now exist for same-gender couples, it won't make marriage for them a possibility for the rest of their lives.The fight for marriage, like the fight against it, has required a great deal of courage. It's also inspired much creativity.I have always loved weddings, and I have always loved the idea of seeing my gay friends get married.I also have a deep and abiding loyalty to the church. I believe in the power and the beauty of marriage. I believe that marriage is a commitment to a lifelong relationship with one person. I believe that I want to be married to my best friend, and I believe that is important for gay and lesbian people to have same-sex relationships. The church has given me many opportunities to express these thoughts during weddings, and in the process, I have found that I can and do respect the church, and respect the church's position on marriage. It's my favorite church on earth.I don't want to argue with the church on everything. But, to me, when you are talking about marriage because of a church position, you are talking about what marriage is in the minds and hearts of some people in the church, and that's not my definition of marriage.A few months ago, I had the pleasure of attending a wedding where one of my best friends would be marrying his best friend. I left the service thinking that this was the most beautiful wedding I had ever attended.I left thinking that the joy of that day was not on the gay wedding, but in the church. In the service, I saw the power of love. The joy of these two people loving and being loved. I saw the love of those who were able to stand in front of the congregation and recognize that loving each other was a part of the very being of Christ. I saw the love in those	0
Rupert Murdoch is the last of a dying breed: An old-fashioned press baron with ink running through his veins, a hefty checkbook, and a hunger for the next big story. Now aged 83, he has spent the past half century turning a  UK tabloid into one of the most profitable in the world.Murdoch's media empire began in the 1930s with the launch of Britain's first daily newspaper, The Sun, and continued with his acquisition of the Daily Mirror in 1941, the Times in 1947, the Sunday Times in 1960, and News Corp's purchase of the rest of the British press in 1982. The purchase of Dow Jones would have been even easier had he not been able to raise the funds from his own resources—in the 1960s, he famously said, he would not have bought the paper had he known that the assets of the Wall Street Journal would become publicly owned.Under Murdoch's stewardship, the number of British papers has dwindled from three to two, while the number of American papers—which has increased in size and influence—has proliferated from five to 12. He has been called, along with US media chief Henry Luce, "the grandfather of modern media." And he has become a billionaire. Despite a relatively modest personal fortune, he has earned a fortune of more than £3 billion, a figure set to soar as shares in his newspapers have soared to almost £400 a share.He is not the only media tycoon to have earned their empire through the power of the press. In the United States, one of the earliest was William Randolph Hearst, who was also a newspaper editor. The media are usually only bought and controlled by rich men who believe in their own values. Murdoch, however, is a product of a different generation—one far more influenced by commercialism than he—and he is not alone.As a result, the British and American press have come to reflect its own peculiar values. In the United States, newspapers tend to be more liberal when compared with the tabloids in Britain, particularly those that are owned by Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch's News-Times, for example, is more pro-choice than is rival News Group Newspapers Inc.'s Sun and Times, which have long been staunchly pro-life. The Sun and the Times have been the only tabloids with pro-market candidates, including Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton's father	0
Sean Connery wasn't supposed to be James Bond. Keanu Reeves wasn't supposed to be "The One." So, who were the original choices? "I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix,'" Will Smith  told MTVNews. "I have no idea what I would have done with it... I would have totally ruined it. It would have been, like, 'That wasn't the right place,' or 'That character was too different.'"For this year's Bond 25, which was produced by EON Productions and Skydance Productions, the producers have a vision for the franchise's future and asked a few big names to join in. "It's like your high school senior year... you get these opportunities, but you don't know what you are doing and what you want to do with them," Smith said.Will Smith, in a video for a charity called the Global AIDS Foundation, speaks to MTV News about making the film and his plans for a future Bond film."A very important part of the script that he and I were discussing was the relationship between James Bond and Michael Myers, as well as a new villain, in the form of the Ripper Killer." Smith said. "I came up with the idea of her as a femme fatale. She could be so cruel. She's like a femme fatale. But I didn't love who I thought would be the villain [in this movie]. I was very focused on introducing the idea of this guy who is really sinister.""I can say that this is another person that would work well for them because of how I feel about Michael Myers," Smith said about the Ripper Killer. "I loved working on those kinds of films. I was always drawn to the villain that was more like me than the hero and then this person who is so different... like this femme fatale that's got to die. That's how I felt about her."So, I asked Smith to come on the show and give his thoughts on this version of Bond, and he told me that "this Bond is an American, and he's a little more 'normal.'" And it's not like this Bond has a wife or kids or anything like that. He doesn't have to keep the family together, he just has a normal life, Smith said."I don't know what it says about America that this person could be so strong	0
The state of Georgia, stricken by months of drought, confirmed Friday that it will sue the Army Corps of Engineers. A view of the East Point Reservoir in Lithia Springs, Georgia, in 2006 ... Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue had said The state of Georgia, stricken by months of drought, confirms Friday it will sue the Army Corps of Engineers.Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue had said he would make a "preemptive" lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.AUGUSTA, Georgia —AUGUSTA — Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue announced Friday he will sue the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for not providing adequate water to residents of his state ravaged by drought.Perdue said he was not seeking help from former President Barack Obama, who had come to Augusta for the summer. Obama is on a weeklong tour of the Gulf Coast. He arrived Friday in New Orleans with a delegation of mayors and governors and is expected to tour flood ravaged areas of Louisiana."I will be doing what I can to get the water back to the people," Perdue said.Perdue made the announcement after nearly 24 years without having the state's two major reservoirs stocked.For almost a week Georgia's two reservoir — East Point and Flint River — have been dry from the Georgia and Florida border to about 75 miles west of Savannah. Most of the southern parts of Georgia are facing similar problems.In the middle of the night Friday Perdue sent a letter by email to the Corps of Engineers, explaining his decision and demanding that the Corps act immediately to refill East Point."The state faces the prospect of losing almost all of its water reserve," the governor said in his 10-page letter, which was published in the Augusta Chronicle."Georgia had been able to store water in more than 1,000 lake and river systems, making it the state with the highest water storage capacity in the nation but it is now facing a potentially catastrophic situation due in part to the inability to store water from rain storms."Perdue said he would not ask the Corps of Engineers for help, but he said he would "make all the necessary efforts to seek the aid of whoever you may need."The Corps has said the East Point reservoir is the only lake in the state that can be filled quickly to meet the state's needs now.	0
The mother of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation Thursday, saying he was "slaughtered" and that she wants to know why. Kimani Gray, 16, died over the weekend. His death triggered protests in Flatbush, a community in Brooklyn where distrust of the police runs deep. "I'm still waiting for Kimani to come home," Carol Gray told reporters during an emotional news conference. She wore dark sunglasses and struggled to speak as she recalled picking the color of her son's casket. "He has a curfew," she said. "Sometimes he's late. Sometimes he's early depending on the night. But whatever time he gets there, I'll be real happy to see him as soon as the bell rings. And for the past couple of days, the bell hasn't rung." According to police, plainclothes officers were on patrol in their car in Flatbush when they saw a group of men gathered on the street at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday. As the officers got closer, Kimani Gray broke from the group and adjusted his waistband. The teen "continued to act in a suspicious manner," so the officers got out of their unmarked car and tried to get his attention, said a NYPD statement. Kimani Gray then "turned on them," it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers. They fired at the teenager, striking him. The teen died at a hospital, and a loaded .38 was recovered from the scene, the statement said. One officer fired four rounds; another fired seven, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Both are now on administrative duty. The officers were taken to a hospital and treated for what the department described as trauma and tinnitus, a ringing in the ears. Gray said that her son was killed in front of his best friend's house. She described him as a typical teenager, into girls and hanging out with friends. Most people in the city likely don't believe what police say happened Saturday, said Councilman Charles Barron, who appeared with the teen's mother at the news conference. For her part, Carol Gray said she did not think her son had a gun, but added, "I wasn't there." "He is not the public's angel, but he's my angel, and he's my baby, and he was slaughtered and I want to know why," she said.	1
Having established itself as Apple's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper, Amazon will now go head to head with the category-defining iPad on its own turf. Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD. That pits the new device, which will ship in late November, against a device with which Apple has, thus far, squashed all direct competition. No tablet that has tried to match the iPad feature-for-feature has gained more than a token foothold in the market. So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up? Because only a few people have gotten their hands on the new device, some questions can't be answered yet. But here's a look at what we do know so far: Price The Fire comes out way ahead on this one, as is to be expected from Amazon, which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay Apple's heftier price tag. For $499, the cost of the lowest-end iPad (the 16GB, WiFi-only model), a buyer can get a 32GB version of the Fire HD with a 4G LTE connection on an upgraded cellular network. The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad. Size While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire. Apple's iPad screen measures 9.7 inches diagonally, while the Fire is at 8.9 inches. That's less than the difference between the screen sizes on the iPhone 4S and the larger Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones. (There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen). But competition between Apple and Amazon could heat up on another front if rumors that Apple plans to release an "iPad Mini" turn out to be true. Display Both tablets feature high-definition screens, although the details vary. The iPad's "retina display" featured a total of 3.1 million pixels, with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536. By contrast, the Fire HD measures 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, with custom features designed to reduce glare and improve color saturation.	1
A militant Islamist group claimed responsibility Monday for bombings the day before that the Nigerian Red Cross said left 50 people dead at three Christian churches in Nigeria. Boko Haram said the attacks Sunday in the Nigerian cities of Lamu and Damasak killed about 350 people.President Obama: "We will be prepared to get involved if Nigeria requests help."The New York Times reported that two U.S. officials with knowledge of the administration's contacts with Israel said they were convinced that Israel had "preferred to deal with Boko Haram indirectly" instead of the U.S.A federal police spokesman said, "The US Embassy in Abuja is aware of reports of recent bombings on Sunday in Nigeria that may be linked to the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram. Federal police have begun an investigation into these reports which we await the results of.""The situation is very serious. The question is what to do about it," said Nigerian Foreign Affairs minister Geoffrey Onyeama as he met with the U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, William Brownfield.Citing a U.N. report, Nigeria's foreign ministry said 200 people were seeking medical assistance after the attacks "of late have been a major cause of distress for the local population."Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group based in northern Nigeria, has killed at least 20,000 people since 2009 and thousands of people have fled their homes to escape the violence, with tens of thousands more displaced internally."The situation in Nigeria is very bad," Nigeria's foreign minister said, adding that "we are talking with a lot of our international friends to see if we can coordinate any assistance."U.S. officials, however, said the U.S. had had “very limited, very minimal” contact with Boko Haram, despite reports it was behind the attacks.“The State Department has had contact with the Government of Nigeria and has provided information to them on a continuing basis,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Abuja. “We have not in any way facilitated or facilitated the release of this particular individual as there appears to be an arrest warrant out for the individual in Nigeria, and therefore we would not be in a position to do that at this time.The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria has not been formally informed of the developments in the case, and would	0
The United States is concerned that Pakistan may have given China access to the high-tech helicopter that crashed in the U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, a U.S. official said Monday. "We have reason to suspect China was given access but we cannot confirm it definitively," said a U.S. official who is not authorized to discuss intelligence matters publicly. "We have strong suspicions." The comment came after news reports suggested Pakistani authorities may have allowed Chinese engineers to see the stealth aircraft. Pakistan's military has denied the allegation, saying there is "no truth to the report." In a written statement, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN the claim is part of a "malicious campaign" against Pakistan's security forces. Abbas "expressed his astonishment at the far-fetched reporting of certain foreign media outlets," the statement said. Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times newspaper in London reported that it had learned that Pakistan "allowed Chinese military engineers to photograph and take samples from the top-secret stealth helicopter." It added that "people close to the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency" told the paper that "the Chinese were in fact given access to the helicopter." China declined to comment, the article said. The New York Times reported that "Pakistan's intelligence service probably allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage," citing "American officials and others familiar with the classified intelligence assessments." It noted that the "American assessments were disclosed" by The Financial Times. When the aircraft crashed during the raid that killed the al Qaeda leader in May, Navy SEALs destroyed most of it to protect the technology. But the tail section remained mostly intact and it was that area that the Chinese engineers examined, according to the New York Times report. China and Pakistan enjoy a long-standing military relationship, and the May raid that killed bin Laden -- staged without informing the Pakistani government -- stoked tensions between Washington and Islamabad. In July, the United States said it was withholding $800 million in aid to Pakistan. "They've taken some steps that have given us reason to pause on some of the aid which we're giving to the military, and we're trying to work through that," White House Chief of Staff William Daley said at the time. CNN's Barbara Starr, Reza Sayah, and Josh Levs contributed to this report.	1
Frankel and Black Caviar. The burning question in the horse racing world is whether its two biggest stars will ever get together. While that once meant "Who would win if they went head to head?" now all the ichor is taken over the internet, but it's also very hard to find out. So the racehorse owner who wants to make sure he and his star horse cross paths will have to know how the game is played.To get a head start, he should start with a study of the betting patterns of the major players. At the end of 2010, for instance, Black Caviar was the third-highest rated filly in the race for the Champion Two-Year-Old Filly at $10,000, four points behind Black Pearl. As far as horses going around the turn, her first three wins had come on the back of races where she got up to win from the start.This means that owners will usually have to make their decision on the back of a race where Black Caviar is the best horse. There have been horses that have done well at the back of the starting gate, but the ones that end up being the winner are usually the fastest horses going around the race course. Thus, the fastest horses going around the turning are the ideal horses to watch going forward.By getting a sense of the winning horses, the owner can get a better sense of which horses might give him a better chance at winning. As is the case with all things in horse racing, however, there is no easy way to do this.The owners of horses who consistently win often give up on trying to predict what the horses will do going forward. They simply bet on the wrong horses.The fastest horses to go around the turn are usually among those that start from behind. In those cases, the odds do make everything look like horse racing. The horse that has the best chance of going around the turn first is the horse favored on the back of the start. This is called the favorite.The best horse going around the turning is the horse to whom the favorite does not have a superior speed in his last three races. When they were racing for the Champion Two-Year-Old Filly at the end of 2010, Black Caviar was the favorite going forward on the back of a very strong run. On the final stage, she went as the favorite and as an underdog, but was still	0
Thailand's prime minister huddled with the chiefs of the country's armed forces early Friday after a string of grenade attacks killed at least one person and wounded dozens of others in the already-tense capital. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva called an emergency meeting of top officials after the Thursday night attacks, which followed weeks of protests aimed at toppling his administration. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told CNN the grenades were launched from the area where the anti-government protesters, known as the Red Shirts, have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks. Suthep told Thai television earlier that three people died in the attacks, but Bangkok's Erawan Emergency and Rescue Center later revised the number to one. At least 87 people were wounded, the center said. Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff. Across the barricades, the Red Shirts were playing music and trying to encourage a festive atmosphere. iReport: Are you there? Share your story, images Demonstrators told CNN late Thursday they wanted to drive home the point that their demonstrations are supposed to be peaceful. Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation. Three of the grenades landed on the roof of the station, but at least one landed outside a nearby hotel, Sansern said. The emergency center, which records patients admitted to Bangkok hospitals, said the victims suffered wounds ranging from light to some more serious injuries. Watch red shirt protests The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They want Abhisit to dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country. Meanwhile, pro-government demonstrators in multicolored shirts have also mobilized to support Abhisit during the crisis. Thailand's military on Monday stationed about 1,500 troops in the area, a Bangkok financial center that houses offices for some of the nation's largest companies. The Red Shirts are occupying a large area nearby. Clashes between the two sides left about two dozen people dead and hundreds wounded on April 10.	1
Paul Tanner, one of the last surviving members of the Glenn Miller Orchestra, died February 5 at an assisted-living facility in Carlsbad, California, his stepson said. Tanner was 95 and died of pneumonia, said Dick Darnall in a telephone interview. Tanner was born in Skunk Hollow, Kentucky, in 1917, but soon left to tour the country with his five brothers and their father, all of them musicians, during the early 1930s. "Everybody was trying to survive during the Great Depression," Darnall said. After one gig, Miller, who scouted his own talent, came up from the audience and "asked Paul to become part of his band." The trombonist went on to play with Miller, who also played trombone, from 1938 until 1942. But when the band leader joined the military and started a military band at military wages, the civilian band broke up. For the next few years, Tanner stayed in Hollywood, where he did studio work, Darnall said. At age 39, he enrolled at UCLA, which offered him a teaching job and advanced degrees upon his graduation four years later; he went on to teach music there for 23 years, Darnall said. Tanner was also working with the ABC Orchestra, where for 16 years he played with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Andre Previn and Arturo Toscanini, Darnall said. His interests included early forms of electronic music, and he developed the Electro-Theremin in the 1950s, said Darnall. The device, which is mechanically linked to an audio oscillator, produced the eery, almost human sounds showcased by the Beach Boys on "Good Vibrations" and on the TV series "My Favorite Martian." The Electro-Theremin also was used in movies, including 1964's "Strait-Jacket," with Joan Crawford. "She was accused of chopping off everybody's heads," Tanner said in an interview in 1997 that is posted on his website. "So, she was a psycho, they thought. There was one spot in the picture where she was to go up the wall, and they put her in a little small room, and then she got more and more and more excited and then she gradually got limp and passed out. And all through that, I'm the only thing playing.	1
As many as 86 Atlanta-based workers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have been unintentionally exposed to anthrax, the agency says. This includes people who have come forward since the announcement Thursday, saying  they were exposed in a 2011 laboratory animal study of the disease and were subsequently diagnosed with it.All told, the outbreak that began in late summer has infected 873 people and caused the death of one, the CDC says. The CDC is calling the illness rare, but is urging anyone who has been a possible, or diagnosed, exposure to anthrax to see their doctor as soon as possible.Some of the patients may have died from the disease, the CDC says. But it’s not possible to know “for certain.”“Our health and well-being are our top priorities,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement. “We are treating this disease.”The CDC says there is no evidence to suggest that one or more employees deliberately contaminated the lab study and the agency has “no information to suggest that anyone has intentionally exposed any employees.” But the CDC says it can’t rule out employee error.

Philip Seymour Hoffman's last wish for his son was that he grow up in New York, Chicago or San Francisco, according to the late actor's will. Hoffman, who died of a heroin overdose earlier this month, left his entire estate to "friend and companion" Mimi O'Donnell, who is the mother of his three children, according to the document released by the Manhattan Surrogate's Court Wednesday. It was signed by Hoffman in October 2004, when his son, Cooper, now 10, was just a year old and before daughters Tallulah and Willa were born. "It is my strong desire, and not direction to my guardian, that my son, Cooper Hoffman be raised and reside in or near the borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, or Chicago Illinois, or San Francisco, California," Hoffman stated in the 13-page will. That provision was in a section that applied only if O'Donnell was not living at the time of his death and if a guardian was to be appointed for his children. If living in his preferred three cities was not possible, Hoffman requested that his son at least visit there twice a year. "The purpose of this request is so that my son will be exposed to the culture, arts and architecture that such cities offer," Hoffman's will said. Noticeably absent from his list is Los Angeles, given Hoffman's fame as a Hollywood actor. Hoffman named O'Donnell as his estate's trustee and executrix of his will. Hoffman, 46, was found on the bathroom floor of his apartment, a needle in his arm. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in "Capote." He earned Academy Award nominations for roles in "Charlie Wilson's War," "Doubt," and "The Master."	1
Eighteen victims of child pornography were rescued during a nationwide sweep by federal law enforcement agencies, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday. The sweep, dubbed Operation Orion, resulted in the arrests of 190 individuals. Most of them were in the U.S., but some were in Argentina, the Philippines, Spain and the United Kingdom, ICE said in a news release. The operation took place from May 1 to May 31. The arrests were made in 33 states and Puerto Rico, authorities said. Some of the victims were residing in the homes of the persons arrested, ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said. For example, a child in San Diego was photographed in a shower, and authorities made a rescue in that home, Bennett said. "Let this operation be a warning to anyone who would think they can use the Internet to exploit children: we are out there looking for you, we will find you, and you will be prosecuted," ICE Director John Morton said in a statement. Morton said that as children begin summer vacations, parents should pay extra attention to how much time they spend on the Internet. "Many of the child exploitation cases under Operation Orion began with a child or teen chatting with someone he or she met online," Morton said in the statement.

The Chinese government is bracing itself for a rush of people wishing to marry when the summer Olympics kick off on August 8 -- because the number carries a special significance in Chinese culture, the state news agency said Sunday. A traditional Ming-style wedding is held in Nanjing, China, last December. The number "eight" (ba) is considered auspicious by many in China because it sounds like the word for "wealth" and "fortune," the news agency Xinhua said. "We've long been prepared for a stampede of newly-wed couples this year," Guo Xusheng, spokesman with the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, told Xinhua. Every year, many couples choose the 8th of August -- the eighth month of the year -- hoping "eighth of the eighth" luck will rub off on them, the news agency said. Nearly 3,400 couples got hitched on the day last year, some waiting all night outside the marriage registration office in Beijing. This year, the civil affairs bureau is accepting online reservations for marriage registrations for the day. The significance that numbers carry in Chinese culture often dictate various aspects of the people's lives there. And of all the numbers, eight is considered one of the luckiest. Beijing, itself, opted to kick off the Olympic Games at 8 p.m. on 8/8/08. E-mail to a friend	1
Wearing a purple polo and stylish Ray Ban sunglasses, Osama Morsy strolled into the interview room calm, confident, and defiant. "What do I see in the coming days? That the revolution will succeed and that the legitimate leader will  be placed in power."This is not a dream. It was not a hallucination. This was not a vision. Osama Morsy, the leader of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah, was sitting here with me in Beirut. We were standing in a green, glass-walled conference room in an upscale restaurant for our meeting with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman on the eve of the second anniversary of Hezbollah's victory in February. I think we were the only people in the green room. No one else was there except for Morsy, a long, slim man in a dark blue suit, who was dressed in light gray pinstriped pants and a dark blue polo shirt tucked into crisp white linen underwear.Morsy sat on another chair that was near the window, a few feet behind me, with his hands in his lap, his elbows resting on the dark gray leather sofa that lined the entire back wall of the room. He asked me to close my eyes so he could focus on the people of the Middle East. I did as he asked, and after several seconds of concentration, the room around me was filled with different green and white patterns."I believe that this revolution will succeed and that the legitimate leader will be placed in power by God," he said. "I also believe that the revolution will spread throughout the Middle East and the world. The Arab Spring—the uprising in the Middle East—is a blessing to the world. I see all of this. I see great people like you who are trying to bring peace to the Middle East. I see a lot of people like you. This is the future of the Middle East. God wants to bless these people in the future. He wants to make them a model for the entire world. We are all part of God's plan."Hezbollah won a major victory when it ousted the pro-Western government of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005.

Serena Williams has revealed she is not in love with playing tennis, despite an impressive straight sets victory on her return to action at the Brisbane  Australian Open.Williams, who is one of the world’s top female players, looked in spectacular form, beating Serena Henman 6-3, 6-2.Asked about whether she was in love with the sport, the 27-year-old said: “I don’t know if I am in love with the sport.”Wearing an all-white courtsuit, she did her best to exude the calmness of a champion, as she approached her third Grand Slam final.World No.1 and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki and defending champion Petra Kvitova were involved in a scrap before the final against 10th seed Karolina Pliskova.“I don’t play games,” said Williams. “And I play to win.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg already owns a good chunk of the Internet, but on Wednesday he won another victory as an appellate court upheld his right to sell his shares of Facebook -- and the court said the move didn't violate anti-trust laws.The Supreme Court also refused to accept Zuckerberg's bid to appeal his decision to sell his stock, saying his challenge is moot because the company he controls is using the money to pay a $5 million fine for using the social media site to promote its political agenda.As the deadline grows near to vote on whether to grant the company's petition to allow it to split itself into two companies, the court is set to decide whether to review an attempt by a Silicon Valley billionaire to make it harder for companies that don't serve the public interest to be traded on stock exchanges.The case in question is Zuckerberg v. Shulman, in which a judge ruled that the founder and chief executive of Facebook can sell shares to avoid the risk of the company being blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission from trading on stock market exchanges, because Facebook "is a public company that serves the public interest."A federal judge in California, however, said the case isn't moot because Zuckerberg hasn't been forced by the judge to sell his shares, and thus his challenge to the ruling has not been resolved.The case is in the Supreme Court's high court for the first time.The Supreme Court said Tuesday that a lawsuit challenging a California judge's ruling forcing an online services company to sell its shares isn't moot.The high court's refusal to hear the appeal was an important step toward clarifying the definition of a "moot case," and has implications for the decision on Wednesday.Zuckerberg's lawyers said justices have a "constitutional responsibility not to accept arguments that do not advance the court's understanding of what the law requires."The suit was filed by California state Attorney General Steve Cooley after Judge Richard Seeborg in May ruled that Facebook failed to prove that it is entitled to block the sale of its shares.Seeborg ruled Facebook is a public company that can't be blocked from buying and selling stock on a public	0
New Zealand may have retained rugby's Sevens World Series in fine style, but Fiji's Samisoni Viriviri claimed the honor of being named the competition's leading player following the finale in England. The flying winger was  the recipient of one, perhaps two, of four first-place votes. Viriviri received two second-place votes for his two tries and 14 points, while halfback Aaron Jones was third with three. In third place was lock Ryan Hall, who helped Fiji to the championship series win in Dubai, which means he will be staying in the Sevens World Series for the first time.The tournament was led by England, which defeated Australia in the final in June to win its ninth title. The New Zealand team, which defeated Russia in the semifinals, advanced to the final with victories over Argentina in the semi-finals and then Tonga in the bronze-winners' play-off. Fiji, Australia and Russia, the latter of which was led by an impressive backline, all also had strong performances.England had a strong finish, winning the final over Australia 11:10 to 8:9. New Zealand's rugby in the final was also strong, with four New Zealand players in the starting pack and three other players named for the final.The first game saw England and New Zealand battle out a hard-fought, back-and-forth battle. They led 5-3 at halftime, but England pulled away in the second half to take a 10-5 lead. In the end, New Zealand came up with another strong response as it led 10-9 late in the game, earning a berth to the final.Australia kept the final strong as it defeated England 13-6. New Zealand and Russia both had a good finish against the home team, with four New Zealand players in the starting XV as well as one from each of the two home nations.In the second semi-final, Japan was looking to become the first Asian nation to win the competition. It was followed closely by Russia, which had to beat Tonga 18-12 in order to advance to the final. China and the Philippines both had to win in order to get in.Russia was the only team to advance, beating Japan 16-14. Tonga kept the momentum going by beating China 10-9 to earn a final berth.

Lone individuals are the most likely to launch attacks in the United States following the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to a joint   Pentagon report. The analysis was based on the   2001 bin Laden compound bombing in May and a second attack in October, both of which failed to kill any U.S. military personnel."From the beginning, we've known that these radical extremists are going to try to do us harm," said Lt. Col. David Paulison, a spokesman for the Army's Fort Bragg intelligence arm. "And they were successful in doing that during the first attack on the compound. "The second attack failed because of a combination of the bin Laden leadership being killed and a lack of U.S. intelligence information pointing to al Qaeda, Paulison said. "Their ability to carry out their operations was limited."The assessment of the new classified report on bin Laden's leadership and al Qaeda is largely a repeat of the conclusions reached by experts in 2009, when the report was reviewed by The New York Times.A copy of the classified report obtained by The Washington Post was heavily redacted, with the exception of key information about information about bin Laden's activities, including his top lieutenants.The report states that after three months of planning, al Qaeda's affiliate in Pakistan, the Pakistani Taliban's Haqqani network, carried out the May 19 attack. Following the failure of the October 1999 World Trade Center bombing, al Qaeda began to launch several attacks targeting the United States."We have no indication that the leaders were actually involved in the planning for the attacks on the World Trade Center and our embassy in Nairobi," Col. Thomas Ryan, the U.S. commander of Central Command and Africa, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in an annual defense policy hearing in February.The Pentagon report, which concluded that the U.S. government had information about al Qaeda leader bin Laden's activities since at least November 1999, said he was the target of an intelligence campaign that killed him between January and May of 2001.The report said that by late 2001, Bin Laden had become increasingly isolated and unable to strike back and so decided to seek refuge in Pakistan. It quoted U.S. intelligence officials as saying that bin Laden's al Qaeda was no longer in direct contact with him.Al Qaeda, it said, was also "at a breaking point. It	0

After a judge temporarily lifted a gag order so that he could respond to allegations made on YouTube by his ex-wife, comedian Steve Harvey Tuesday released court documents saying those allegations are false. Mary Harvey posted a YouTube video last month, alleging, "I'm going to reveal a lot of things about the things that were going on in my marriage to Steve and I'm going to get out of this situation." After the posting, her lawyer accused Harvey of using his media company, VH1, to do her dirty work. Mary Harvey and her lawyer, J. P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, said they will be releasing information in the coming weeks about Harvey's actions. (The Washington Post)A lawsuit was filed against Harvey and his company, VH1, Friday afternoon alleging he violated a former wife's right to privacy. (Los Angeles Times)The lawsuit was filed in state court in Delaware, where Harvey has offices in New York and Washington. (ABC News)The lawsuit alleges that Harvey used his personal fortune to pay for a private jet flight to Washington in September to discuss divorce and custody issues with one of his former wives. (Los Angeles Times)The lawsuit contends that Mary Harvey, a former wife of the comedian, had her children removed from his custody when she accused him of domestic violence and child abuse. (Los Angeles Times)A lawyer for Harvey released a statement to the Associated Press saying his "sole purpose in the divorce was to secure more money for the family." The statement added that his $15-million-a-year VH1 is "a place where the public can come and hear his views on current events, but it is not a forum for personal attacks."Harvey, who was ousted as the head of VH1 in 2012, is suing his ex-wife for $15.5 million over her allegations that he abused and emotionally abused her for more than a decade during their marriage. (Los Angeles Times)Harvey will take part in a series of interviews with a number of publications and media companies, including MSNBC's Morning Joe and CNN's New Day with John King.

Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, more than 25 years after he was treated for Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman at his company Vulcan Inc. told CNN on Monday. Allen, 56, "received the diagnosis early this month and has begun chemotherapy," Vulcan CEO Jody Allen said in a memo to Vulcan employees. The memo was posted Monday evening on CNET's news site. "Doctors say he has diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a relatively common form of lymphoma," Jody Allen, who is Paul Allen's sister, said in the memo. "This is tough news for Paul and the family. But for those who know Paul's story, you know he beat Hodgkin's a little more than 25 years ago, and he is optimistic he can beat this, too." The memo said Paul Allen is feeling OK, is still working and "has no plans to change his role at Vulcan," which is based in Seattle, Washington. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, like the less-common Hodgkin's disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is distinguished from the other by the presence of a certain type of cell. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in the mid-1970s, was that company's chief technologist until he left the company in 1983, the year he was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to the Web site for his Paul G. Allen Family Foundations. In September, Allen ranked 17th in the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.  His net worth was $11.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Among Allen's business interests are the professional sports teams he owns, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. He also is part owner of Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.	1
A man police believe is a member of the ''Pink Panther'' ring of thieves was transported from Spain to Michigan and murdered, along with three other people believed to be associates of the ring.John Wojciechowski, 34, was the mastermind behind a multi-million dollar scheme where thieves would kidnap their victims and sell them for $25,000 each.They would then disappear into the woods, with the victims never knowing what happened to them.Police say Wojciechowski was killed during a high speed chase through the city of Grand Rapids last week that involved five vehicles and several law enforcement officers.His body was found by a Michigan State Police motorcyclist while driving by a hotel in Kalamazoo on May 26.Two weeks after Wojciechowski's disappearance, Michigan State Police arrested a Michigan man and two women in a raid near Lansing, in connection with the case.In the search for Mr. Wojciechowski and the other three, the police believe he had the money to purchase the five-carat purple Heart of Spain diamond earrings from his last victim's jewelry box.The victim's $20,000 diamond earrings were later seized by police after he was murderedMr. Wojciechowski was the ring leader of the kidnappings and robberies that took place in Michigan, where police estimate about 700 jewel-robbed victims were taken and sold for $25,000 each.Police say Mr. Wojciechowski was the mastermind behind a multi-million dollar scheme from 2004-2005 where he and his accomplices would kidnap his victims, strip them and sell them for a fraction of what they were worth.They would then vanish into the woods without the victims ever knowing where they have goneWojciechowski was responsible for robbing at least four people across the country of diamond earrings from their jewelry boxes.An arrest warrant for Mr. Wojciechowski's arrest was issued on June 1, 2005.Mr. Wojciechowski and his accomplices would hold the victims captive and make them drive out to a remote area on a dirt road and remove the victim's jewelry box.From there, they would dump the jewelry inside a Dumpster and remove the victim's wallets, cell phones, keys,	0
Trash litters its cities. Electricity is sporadic at best. There is no clean water. Medical and educational services are limited. Basic infrastructure is severely lacking. "Planet in Peril" met in a secret location with members of the Movement for Re-education and Social Responsibility to discuss this reality. People spoke openly and without inhibition about their lives in South Africa.The meeting of Re-education and Social Responsibility started with an update on the government's work on AIDS. Re-education members reported on the death rate of children, the impact of AIDS, and the need for education. Sustainability was also discussed.One topic during the meeting that caused dismay was the use of AIDS drugs in general by the government of South Africa. People were outraged that the government has allowed drugs to be used to support a failing system.The meeting went on to talk about how the drug regime was hurting people. After this discussion, the members of Re-education and Social Responsibility began to talk about how to change the current approach towards treating AIDS. They did all of this in a clear, yet private manner so that people could not see what was going on.People told about the impact that the drugs currently have (and some had heard of this from the media) on people's bodies, their families, and their finances.  The meeting went on for a while about the use of these drugs.When the meeting ended, people began to move up the hill towards the secret "bomb shelter" that they had been building. The meeting was over and people went their separate ways.SourcesExternal links  http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ngo-interactive-global-report-2011/2008/jul/03/south-africaCategory:South African activistsCategory:South African political party factionsCategory:South African Re-Education MovementCategory:HIV/AIDSCategory:South African societyCategory:South Africa-related listsCategory:South African political neologismsCategory:South African politics-related listsCategory:Political party factions in South AfricaCategory:Re-education	0
"Big Bang Theory" fans can breathe a sigh of relief. According to Deadline, the stars of the hit CBS series have agreed to hefty pay increases for the new season. Quoting unnamed sources, the publication reports that Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco have secured three-year deals for "$1 million per episode for the 72 episodes the show is slated to produce in Seasons 8-10." According to reports, the trio will also have an increased stake in the show's backend profits. It's been said that the trio previously received more than $300,000 per episode. The Hollywood Reporter confirmed the deal in its story and said co-stars Kunal Nayyar  and Simon Helberg were still in negotiations, but expected to sign a deal soon. Warner Bros. Television told CNN that "we aren't commenting on the speculation at this time." Earlier, the company confirmed that "ongoing contract negotiations" had caused production on "The Big Bang Theory's" eighth season to be postponed. Production had been scheduled to begin July 30 and on  Tuesday the company released a statement saying "Production on season 8 of 'The Big Bang Theory' will begin Wednesday, August 6, with contract negotiations now having been concluded." Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company. The new deals would put Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco in the same territory as the former cast of "Friends," who also negotiated for pay raises at the height of their show's popularity. The popular series was renewed in March. Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, who also appear on the show, are reported to have received raises in September.

Friends and family of Holly Bobo, last seen in 2011, waited three years for news. Their worst fears have now been confirmed. A man has been indicted on charges of kidnapping and murder in the case of the Tennessee woman, authorities announced Wednesday. Zachary Adams, 29, is being held without bond. A Decatur County grand jury handed down a two-count indictment of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. "As this investigation continues, we are still asking for the public's help and support to help us continue to seek out justice regarding the disappearance of Holly Bobo," Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters. Because the investigation is ongoing, Gwyn declined to comment on whether any human remains have been found. Bobo, a nursing student, was last seen in April 2011. She was 20 years old. Her brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading her away from their home in the small town of Darden. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- turned out to hunt for clues in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Many more attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via groups on Facebook. The TBI and local and federal authorities have spent hundreds of manpower hours on the case, Gwyn said. More than $450,000 has been offered in reward money. Adams, who is being held at the Chester County jail, is set to appear in court on Tuesday. Prosecutors are evaluating whether they will seek the death penalty. "Obviously, they're devastated," Gwyn said of the Bobo family. "They've been devastated for three years. But, hopefully, this is the beginning of closure for the Bobo family, and they deserve that." Missing woman was 'in fear of her life'	1
Getting ahead in your career is not just about being successful; it's about being noticed. So how do you stand out to be hired by potential employers? How do you stand out for a promotion to a superior? How do you stand  out as an individual with a positive work history? How do you stand out as a valued employee at your current company? How do you stand out at a new company? How do you stand out as a young professional who wants to advance and advance?I don't know any young professional who has not had a chance to think through these questions. As I mentioned earlier in the book (page 3), there are at least two competing pressures on young professionals: (1) to be sought after and noticed as a "hot shot" and (2) to find a career that pays and fits your talents. These pressures can be confusing and conflicting because there are many more career options than options. I think we'll have to see who survives the first year in their career and whether they are able to avoid the second.I'm glad I'm not alone. I've been in this exact same position, but I have a good perspective now on what it takes to survive in this competitive climate. The most important things to remember are this:  * If you don't like your job, work hard and keep trying for a better job.  * If you do like your job, then keep getting promoted.  * If you have a "real" job, then keep working on it.  * If you have no job at all, then work on your career.  * Sometimes you have to choose your career.# Why is this book about how to get ahead in your career?I'm convinced that the career you're building is the most important and influential aspect of your life. As I mentioned earlier on page 36, I've learned that I am a social creature. If I didn't like my job, I would want to work on moving up, and I would want that job. I can't say the same about career advancement; it tends to be a choice that's either forced on you by your parents or is something you make. The key is recognizing that no one gets ahead in a career unless you take control of your own destiny.I've worked in a myriad of positions over the years: from working as a houseman, doing landscaping, working in	0
State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that "people need to serve where they are needed." Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of "directed assignments" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq "a potential death sentence" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week.  Watch the diplomats exchange angry words » "I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues," said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. "Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK," Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do "everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats." However, she said, "This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations." Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, "I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed."	1
We arrived in Mali's capital city, Bamako, on January 22, a four-person emergency assessment team rapidly deployed by International Medical Corps. With violence raging throughout the country as French and Malian forces  fight to secure Bamako-the-capital-from-a-Malian-mafia, a team of medical experts, and our two teams from Doctors Without Borders (MSF), set out to establish a medical clinic, two hospitals, and a community outreach office - all in one week.Our primary mission was to provide basic medical services for people without access to adequate medical care during a conflict zone. We were also supporting Bamako University Hospital's emergency response team, providing medical supplies, equipment, and personnel. As the conflict intensified, so did MSF's medical staff. Over a five-day period, two of our three teams were dispatched to the hospital, to help treat patients in need. We established a clinic, three emergency rooms, and a surgery unit that was later expanded to include 10 operating rooms and a pediatric unit. In collaboration with several local hospitals, MSF provided care during the first day of fighting.Our medical team did just that: provide free medical treatment to victims of the war. As the medical team made its way through the streets of the city, we were stopped by both a Malian army officer and a local militia leader who asked, with some apprehension, "Are we a group of armed fighters?" In Bamako, people were just as scared as we were to tell them our mission. When we told them, most of the locals were more interested in what "armed fighters" meant; they wanted to know if this could be a terrorist group.We explained that we were "Doctors, Nurses, Paramedics...medical workers...and we work just for the community," in the words of MSF's medical coordinator, Jean-François Schillace.Our medical team's mission in Bamako is ongoing. When the rainy season starts, our team of five doctors is expected to be on-site to provide basic health care in the emergency room.Our medical staff members, a team of three nurses, and our four paramedics make Bamako their home. Our medical team was on the frontlines, assisting victims of war, delivering babies, and making sure that basic needs are being met in the city.MSF's staff members work tirelessly providing services in a war	0
Months after accepting asylum in Russia, fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden on Thursday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices. "Does Russia intercept, store or analyze in any way the communications of millions of individuals?" Snowden asked in English via a video link during Putin's annual question-and-answer program, which was broadcast on state television. "And do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies, rather than their subjects, under surveillance?" Putin responded that Russia has a special service that bugs telephone conversations and Internet communications to fight crimes, including terrorism, but only with court permission and only "for specific citizens." "So, the mass character is something we do not have and cannot have," Putin said in Russian. "On such a mass scale ... we do not allow ourselves to do this, and we will never allow this. We do not have the money or the means to do that," he said. Putin, a former intelligence agent, noted that his questioner, a former National Security Agency contractor, shares that background. "So, we can speak in professional language," he said. Snowden last year disclosed details of the vast U.S. surveillance network put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including the government's record keeping on billions of phone calls. Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Moscow. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. Last month, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told National Public Radio that U.S. officials must plan for the possibility that Russia has access to American battle plans and other secrets. "If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries -- in this case, of course, Russia," Flynn said. He cited intelligence capabilities, operational capabilities, technology and weapons systems as potential subjects that Snowden -- and now Russia -- may have. "We have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised," Flynn said. Last October, Lon Snowden visited Moscow, where he told reporters that his 30-year-old son told him he had had no contact with Russian security or intelligence.	1
Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has spoken of his relief at finally making public the fact he is gay -- and now wants to become a role Â­model for other closeted gay men in Wales.Thomas, who has played 170 times for Wales, is now a father of three children with partner Scott Thomas, who he has been with since 2011.The pair met after Thomas spotted Scott's gay flag on the team car of his former club Carmarthen.Told Thomas was gay in 2007 to see if he was in a relationship, he replied he was "a bit gay but not super-gay".After talking to Scott, he decided to come out, telling his teammates at the time, including team-mate and current Wales head coach Warren Gatland, that while he loved being gay, he didn't think he was going to be with anyone else.Now, after 12 years, Thomas spoke of his happiness that he has finally said the words he was afraid to say for so long."I want to be a role model to anyone who lives with their sexuality or feels they are different or have experienced homophobia," he said.Thomas, who was born to a Welsh father and Scottish mother, added: "I've been a role model so far in my life and I haven't had to really get down in the nitty-gritty of it, I've just been happy to talk to people about who I am and what it means to me."It was Thomas who was the first gay sportsman to come out in Wales to his teammates at the 2006 Six Nations Championship, when he said: "I was very reluctant when I first came out to my rugby team, a lot of them were gay and I was worried that they would think poorly of me if I came out and the rugby team were gay."Now, Thomas is happy to open up to his children, but he said he was unsure about what he would say to them."I'm not really sure what they would think of me having a gay dad or a gay grandfather and a gay child. I certainly would never want to see them suffer, but I am nervous about how they would handle news that their family has a gay member."There are some important things to say to children and it is very important that we talk openly about our family, in that respect I hope, as a man	0
The world will soon see an "explosion" of swine flu cases as the H1N1 virus spreads rapidly around the world, a top World Health Organization official said Friday. Spread of the H1N1 Â 2009 virus was "much higher than our initial estimates," said Dr. Margaret Chan of WHO's global health emergencies program in Geneva.But, she added, "the epidemic curve is still expected to peak in the middle of next week," with the number of new reported cases declining as H1N1 subsides. Chan said that she expected the epidemic curve to be flattened out in the late summer.The WHO's global influenza coordinator, Dr. Margaret Chan, said that a flu epidemic has already taken hold in many countries, including Asia, Europe and the United States. She said that the H1N1 virus "spread much faster than was initially predicted."To date, around 940 people in the United States have been confirmed as infected with H1N1, with two deaths reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This is the first time that the WHO has been forced to make a global emergency about the spread of a new flu strain, she said.Chan said that it will take time to determine whether the global spread of H1N1 has reached the level of a pandemic.H1N1 was already reported this week by a Spanish nurse who recovered from the illness after returning to her country. The nurse, who had recently returned from a trip to Mexico, is the first person to contract the virus in Spain.Last month, the WHO also issued a warning about the spread of the H1N1 virus, saying that it was "not yet under control in the global population."Chan did not rule out a pandemic, but said it could be prevented by better surveillance, and other measures, not available in the United States, such as "early infection control and quarantine measures" in all commercial settings.Chan, who is a member of the U.S. Senate, said that she was "heartened and gratified by the response" of the U.S. public, including President Barack Obama, who will meet with her Friday at the White House. Chan said she will also receive U.S. representatives from all 50 states.U.S. Representative Chris van Hollen (D-Md	0
There's a standard Atlantic City itinerary: arrive at one of the many casinos along the Boardwalk, head straight for the card tables and slot machines, drink some complimentary cocktails and proceed to empty your  casino  winnings . Or you can take in a show at a nearby theater (or find something really classy, like a night at the opera) before walking back to the hotel. For the best of the gaming action, though, it's all part of Atlantic City's "Lucky Harbor" package: two casinos, a resort and a full-service hotel. The casino at Harrah's Casino and New Jersey's first resort — the Sands — will feel like a big deal. The resort's new  Harrah's Atlantic City Ocean Club , which opens in October, is pretty much just a big, new casino and new hotel.While Atlantic City has long been in the casino business's crosshairs, the arrival of Harrah's in the area has been one of the most transformative shifts in the local economy. The state's economy is booming, and there is a lot of room for expansion. But the city's casino population is expected to decline from about 200 when Harrah's Atlantic City Ocean Club opens in October to about 100. Even more troubling, the city is losing money every year it keeps the casino open, according to city records.The situation begs the question: Is Atlantic City losing money by keeping the casino open? Or, by putting money into Harrah's that it might have saved and investing it in the city's infrastructure and housing and everything else? The answer is not entirely clear, and we may never know for sure."The city's a casino city, and they have no choice," says Steven Green, the executive director of the Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, a source of information and inspiration for our research. "If they close the casino, then we're in a lot more of a hole than we're accustomed to as a city. [Atlantic City] is one of the reasons we've had to start investing so heavily in Atlantic City's infrastructure and in housing."Harrah's's plans include construction of a $180 million hotel next door to the resort. It also will build a resort next door to the Atlantic City Convention Center and extend its parking lots into the convention center parking lot. All of that creates a lot of space for potential new uses for the Convention Center and a big opportunity for residents	0
My brothers." That is how President Obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at Morehouse College this Sunday. Addressing the historically black all male institution gives Obama an opportunity to rectify his strategic neglect of African-Americans. In this high-profile talk to his own demographic, the president has some explaining to do. Obama's identity as a black man is usually communicated subliminally, with the swag in his walk, the basketball court on the East Lawn, the sexy glances at the first lady, his overall cool. Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern. That's the good work that calling us "brothers" would do. In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing. He told the Congressional Black Caucus to "stop grumbling, stop complaining, stop crying." In a Father's Day talk at a black church in Chicago, he criticized "too many fathers" for "acting like boys not men." African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history. They are on the bottom of many indicators of achievement. They suffer the highest level of incarceration, and the largest homicide rates, of any Americans. In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school. Their unemployment is among the highest in the country. "I'm sorry I haven't done more." The president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration. He has not memorialized the mainly African-American victims of gun violence in Chicago the way he has memorialized the mainly white victims of gun violence in Newtown and Columbine. Asked why he hadn't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of African-American unemployment, Obama said, "I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks. I'm president of the entire United States." "Thank you for your support." Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.	1
There are two good ways to buy your new car or truck at a reasonable low price and avoid all of the negotiating games and hassles: 1. Buy through the Internet Buying your new or used car or truck through the Internet is the easiest and most hassle-free way to make the purchase. All you have to do is choose the vehicle brand and model you wish to purchase as well as provide some basic contact information such as your name and e-mail address. In return, you'll receive - via e-mail - low bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area for the exact vehicle you want to buy. Compare the various selling prices and find the lowest one. Then, simply go direct to that dealership's Internet Department, sign the papers and drive your new car home - no negotiating, no hassles. To begin the process, get your free price quotes from AOL Autos. It only takes a few minutes. This service is totally free and you are under no obligation or pressure to buy. AOL, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner. Within 24 hours, you'll receive your bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area. Once you've compared the various prices and found the lowest one, you then have four good options: • You can go to the dealership that gave you the lowest price, sign the papers and drive your new car home -- no hassles, no negotiating. AOL Autos: Best deals of the month • You can try to negotiate the lowest price with the dealership in order to get the price even lower. There's nothing that says you can't. AOL Autos: Aggressive car buying tactics • You can shop the lowest price around to other dealerships to see if any of them are willing to beat it. AOL Autos: Which dealers treat you best? • You can do nothing. If you feel unsure or uncertain, then set it aside for a while. You are not obligated to buy anything you don't want. By getting these low bottom-line selling prices via the Internet, you're avoiding the car salesman's entire negotiating game altogether. And you're buying your car at about the same price you would expect after lengthy negotiations. It's certainly the fastest and easiest way to beat the car salesman. AOL Autos: New rules to car buying 2. Buy through the dealership's Fleet Department	1
Manager Ozzie Guillen was back in the dugout Tuesday night after serving a five-game suspension imposed by the Miami Marlins for his comments praising former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and angering the city's sizable Cuban-American  base, which has a history of protests.Guilli was the first manager to be suspended after comments he made at a book signing in Miami when he was still an executive with the Washington Nationals. He apologized for the incident, saying to the Associated Press that he was only trying to promote a good cause by speaking positively about the late dictator. There are, however, no good causes for the Marlins and that's the problem, he told MLB.com."They're the most hated people in this world," he said. "I'm not going to sit here and lie and say I don't have a problem with them, but I certainly have a problem with how they've handled themselves the last three years of this city's history, and I think I've been pretty clear in my statements, and they've just done everything, they've done exactly what I asked."But the Marlins had already decided to go for it, with Guillen telling reporters that he had been advised by their front-office staff that they might be able to land the manager who was so outspoken about their home city."I've been advised they feel they've got an opportunity to get me," Guillen said. "So I'll remain under contract and I'll accept whatever they've got to offer."He will receive a $500,000 guarantee if he agrees to remain in his current position, he said.Guillen wasn't happy about his suspension and said he was "furious" over what he called the Marlins' "shameless political opportunist" approach to his comment the day before. But, he said, he was glad to get a chance to talk with the Marlins again. And he had a good talk with the city during a private visit Sunday."I think the city is aware in an effort to move past this, you know, to just move on from this, to just move on from it, to get back to business as usual," Guillen told MLB.com. "So, I hope that that happens. I feel like the city is aware and wants to move on."Guillen said he was "excited" by the	0
The death toll from the magnitude-7.1 earthquake in the central Philippines rose Saturday to 183, authorities said. The massive earthquake triggered a tsunami that inundated about half of the city of Tacloban with up to 10 feet of water, forcing people to flee or risk drowning.The quake was felt across most of the western half of the archipelago, with the worst damage along the northeastern coast."It's devastating," said Dioscoro Aguirre, a spokesman for the city's public safety and disaster agency. "All buildings are submerged."Tsunami waves reached up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in height in the northern part of Leyte and flooded a major bridge. The death toll rose to 23, local police reported, as rescuers worked to reach more than 80,000 survivors."We need as many boats as possible to rescue people," said mayor Alfred Romualdez as he surveyed the smashed roadways and buildings. "We may have to take everyone to shore, or stay on the beach and help build a new world there."Tacloban was about 350 miles southwest of Manila and about 100 miles inland from Leyte Island, where waves as high as 10 m (33 feet) were reported to have hit the coast and a city of about one million people was submerged.The worst damage was reported on the coast.A man paddled a dugout canoe through a flooded street in Tacloban. "It is terrifying to see a city like this," said Jhiany Villanueva, an administrator in the northern part of the city."I'm still trapped in my house with my children and I don't know what to do," he said. "This is what we live for — we have everything."A man stood in waist deep water, on the edge of the shoreline, on a river that was barely moving."We got about 2.5 m (8 feet) of water, which makes the streets look like an aquarium," said Jose Manguerra, a spokesman for the city's disaster agency. "All the houses in Tacloban are now submerged."The death toll was expected to rise dramatically as more bodies were pulled out of houses that were swept by the tsunami. At least 27 people were listed in critical condition at a	0

A man who for 20 years has lived near one of six men accused of sexually abusing young relatives said he finds the allegations "absolutely unbelievable." Bob Ramsey, a retired Graceland University chemistry professor and David Vince Wilmer's father, said he has learned to accept the idea that sexual abuse is a problem and to "stay away" from church members and school staff who might know something about his son's alleged victims. But Ramsey, who has not talked to Wilmer since he graduated from high school in the mid-1970s, said what's been said so far is "quite frightening." "As I've been watching this story develop now, it's absolutely incredible that something like this would happen in this day and age, and it's unbelievable, totally inconceivable, but what's happened in some cases is absolutely frightening," Ramsey said. A church deacon, former school teacher and Wilmer's childhood friend said he had been at the Wilmer family home on Monday and said there were three young children, three boys, ages 6, 7 and 11. The women said Wilmer, now 56, began molesting them when they were 11 years old, when they were sitting on a carpet with their heads on his lap, the deacon said. Wilmer also gave them marijuana, which the girls ingested, and took photos of the girls' naked bottoms, the deacon said. Most of the girls were under 16, Ramsey said. Wilmer "took pictures of them naked and put them in a scrapbook," Ramsey said. The deacon and the women said the abuse continued until the girls were 17 years old, after the boys came back from boarding school, Ramsey said. They continued to be molested, the deacon said, and Wilmer kept a record in a notebook and a file of about 100 photographs of the girls, Ramsey said. The women said they were abused by their fathers and brothers, as well. Wilmer, now married, has not been seen in public since leaving Graceland College in 1979. He has not returned telephone calls from The Associated Press. His divorce had been scheduled to go to trial in July. Wilmer graduated in 1973 with more than 4,000 hours of courses, including chemistry, math and biology. He earned a master's degree in 1976 and a	0
The Supreme Court gave unanimous support to an American father's court fight to regain custody of his daughter living overseas, saying the case is still active even if the child is out of  court for more than 12 years.On Friday, a divided Supreme Court reversed a lower court's ruling and ordered the family court judge to restore the girl's father's custody.“We are pleased by today’s decision overturning the lower court’s judgment of child custody,” said Peter J. Smith, an attorney for the father.He said the ruling will allow the father to make regular supervised visits with the 17-year-old girl, who spent most of her life living abroad and has a U.S.-born sister.“It gives the father much more time with his daughter, and assures that she will continue to live in close proximity to him,” Mr. Smith said.Mr. Smith said his client is doing well, and is “more focused on his daughter than ever” after Thursday’s ruling. He declined further comment.The girl, who was 15 when her father filed the case, was born in April 1994 while her mother was in a serious car accident in New Zealand that left her with severe brain damage. She was moved to the United States shortly after being turned over by her mother and raised mostly by her father and grandparents.The family court judge in Delaware issued a final order granting the father temporary custody in October 2006, after the girl’s father alleged he and the mother were not speaking.The family court judge in Delaware concluded that while the girl had strong emotions, they were “not of a magnitude necessary to compel the court to grant the father his requested custody.” The judge ordered both parents to attend counseling on the issues of trust, conflict management and safety.A separate family court judge in Maryland heard both sides and decided against granting the father any physical custody. The ruling was issued in 2009. He had filed a motion for enforcement in 2011, which was denied. The father appealed to the Delaware Court of Appeals and it was denied without a hearing in September 2011. The father asked the Delaware court for a hearing and a decision on his appeal was expected soon.A federal appeals court sided with the father in 2011, but the case was sent back to Delaware for re-evaluation in light of its	0
The Voice" crowned Texas teen Danielle Bradbery its new winner on Tuesday, proving to the country singer that she could do what she'd thought to be impossible. "I remember singing in my room to my wall, just acting like there's so many people out there even though I knew I could never do that," Bradbery told CNN after her big win. "My mom wanted to do something about my voice, and signed me up and we took a road trip to Dallas for 'The Voice' (auditions) not knowing what was going to happen. I was scared to death. And it led to me being the winner, and that is unbelievable." The 16-year-old claimed the title during Tuesday's finale of the NBC singing competition, which was packed with performances from Cher, Bruno Mars and "Voice" coach Christina Aguilera, who will return to the series next season after a short hiatus. Bradbery is "The Voice's" youngest winner, and also the third victor in a row from coach Blake Shelton's team. Shelton, who was celebrating his 37th birthday on Tuesday, told CNN that he doesn't try to win as much as he tries to build a team that excites him. "This year, I finally got the country team that I dreamed of since day one, and I have a little bit more knowledge about that than I had in the past," he said. "But the truth is, anybody could win if they have Danielle Bradbery. She's just an incredible, God-given gift to the music industry. Anybody who can sing like that, with almost no experience whatsoever coming into this thing, is very special. Any producer, no matter what genre, would be thankful to work with somebody that talented." New "The Voice" coach Usher Raymond saw one of his mentees, Michelle Chamuel, land in second place, while the Swon Brothers from Shelton's team came in third. The show itself was a huge ratings winner for NBC on Tuesday, as the finale pulled in 15.3 million viewers. That marked "The Voice's" most-watched finale to date, and it also surpasses the 14.3 million who watched "American Idol's" 12th season finale on Fox in May.	1
A Detroit man, who stabbed an officer outside a courtroom and escaped wearing the officer's uniform, has been captured, authorities  say.The Michigan Attorney General's Office says David Edward Leininger was recaptured Tuesday after leading police on a foot chase through his home city and a suburb Tuesday afternoon.Police say Leininger, 34, drove a white Toyota four-door car to an apartment complex in Detroit, located about 35 miles northwest of The Michigan State University. He went to an apartment complex near the intersection of Edsel and Grand River streets, and then to an apartment complex on Saginaw Street.Police say Leininger tried to hide in one of the apartments and called police. He then exited with a knife and stabbed one officer.Police were able to cut the chase short after about two hours of foot chases.He was captured after a foot chase in his neighborhood, police said.His escape was not a case of an innocent officer, police say."These two officers have been injured, in a very serious way and they're obviously being treated for it," said Oakland County Sherriff's Detective Sgt. Jim Cleland. "Our officers have responded to this call and obviously they feel the need to protect and serve this community."Leininger is being held in the Oakland County jail while awaiting an extradition hearing.The attorney general says an investigation is underway to determine what Leininger's motive was for leaving the courtroom to attack an officer, but the motive has not been determined yet.Police were first called to the courtroom in the Wayne County Circuit Court.Two of Leininger's victims are still recovering from the attack.The attorney general says a preliminary investigation shows Leininger was intoxicated and the knife he used was an 11-inch, two-and-a-half-inch sword that is similar to a sword used by the Navy SEALs.Leininger was in custody Monday at the Oakland County Jail. His preliminary hearing was set for Tuesday.Copyright 2014 by ClickOnDetroit.com. All rights reserved.

The Thai army declared martial law throughout the country Tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled Prime Minister said the government didn't know about beforehand. "They took this action unilaterally. The ills for which the army is responding are not a result of policies of the government," said the aide, who was not allowed to be interviewed. The army announced that it had launched a crackdown in response to the unprecedented protests by 1,500 monks, who occupied a government building in the capital, Bangkok, since last Wednesday.The army chief, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, said "we would not stand by" while 1,500 monks occupied the site. And the foreign minister, Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said that the government couldn't allow the state-run media to continue its coverage of the protests, and that foreign journalists shouldn't cover the demonstrations.But one of the first victims of the crackdown was the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, David W. Barbe. The ambassador was arrested under a draconian law that has been employed in repressive countries such as Indonesia since the days of the Dutch colonial government. The law bars non-foreign citizens from being sent to Thailand; however, Barbe was able to get an exemption from the law as he was a citizen of the U.S. The U.S. has issued a travel warning (of "high concern") to its citizens advising them to avoid the country.The U.S. embassy also issued warnings to its citizens about demonstrations in Thailand.Foreign students, students of other countries, and any non-foreign workers were also warned against travel to Thailand. "Although the situation has changed, we are not recommending that foreign nationals return to Thailand and would not recommend leaving because of the lack of safety and other risks," the U.S. embassy said.The U.S. embassy advised citizens to contact Thai authorities after the demonstration as they have information about other demonstrations scheduled for Wednesday. "If you are a foreign citizen, you should immediately contact local law enforcement authorities in any affected area," the warning said. According to witnesses and media reports, the army deployed around 200 soldiers to the scene in the early morning hours of Tuesday. But when demonstrators tried to force their way into the main building of the office of the military's intelligence chief, it was barricaded by troops. A Reuters reporter said soldiers then charged a group of demonstrators, sending	0
While the visiting national news media focuses on the latest utterances of Republican presidential hopefuls in advance of the January 3 caucuses, many Iowans have found a bone to pick with a journalism professor -- from the University of Iowa, no less -- who wrote: "Whether a schizophrenic, economically depressed, and some say, culturally challenged state like Iowa should host the first grassroots referendum to determine who will be the next president isn't at issue. ... In a perfect world, no way would Iowa ever be considered representative of America, or even a small part of it. Iowa's not representative of much." Iowans are wondering what they did to incur the wrath of Stephen G. Bloom, who for 20 years has taught journalism at the state's flagship university and shared his observations in an article for The Atlantic magazine titled "Observations from 20 Years of Iowa Life." It may be a good thing that Bloom, a native of New Jersey, has been away teaching this semester at the University of Michigan because in trying to explain "in both a real and metaphysical way, what Iowa is," he has drawn the ire of Iowans literally from all corners of the state -- from Sibley and Keokuk (whose mayor has invited him to visit and explain the "a depressed, crime-infested slum town" remark) to Decorah to Shenandoah. In the interest of full disclosure, many of my childhood vacations (including winter) were spent visiting my mother's parents in Iowa. I graduated from a college in Iowa, and my first full-time job in journalism was at a newspaper in Iowa, so I admit to a certain fondness for the state. And every four years, as the political spotlight shines on Iowa, I share with colleagues whatever helpful insights I can muster. Blitzer's blog: Turbulence in Iowa The state is not one large cornfield, but driving along Interstate 80, it can appear that way for long stretches. Visit northeast Iowa along the Mississippi River for proof that the state is not flat. Iowa's farms not only help feed the United States, but also much of the world, connecting this piece of "flyover country" to a global view. Still, economists report that agriculture only accounts for roughly one in five jobs in the state.	1
Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round. "Most of the protests were peaceful, although disruption was caused to the road network in Belfast and across the country," police said in a statement. One of the most serious incidents occurred at O'Neil's Road in Newtownabbey, where about 100 Protestant rioters -- many of them teenagers -- threw concrete blocks, paving slabs, bricks, planks of wood, gasoline bombs and Molotov cocktails at police. They targeted about 30 armored police vehicles and as many as 100 police officers clad in riot gear. At least one officer appeared injured. His head bowed, the officer was helped away by comrades. Amid rain and temperatures just above freezing, police brought in two water cannon, deploying one of them to push back the rioters. Police were trying to gain control of a main highway. In pictures: Flag protests in Northern Ireland In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said. Thirty-three gasoline bombs were thrown at police during the demonstrations, after which all the roads were reopened. Read more: Clinton urges calm amid tensions in Northern Ireland The eruptions occurred after two nights of calm that followed five consecutive nights of rioting. Belfast has been at the center of a wave of protests prompted by the City Council's December 3 decision to limit the flying of the flag to 18 days per year. The disorder has resulted in more than 100 arrests and left 66 officers injured. The flag was raised Wednesday for the first time since the controversial vote to mark the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine. It was lowered at the end of the day. The leaders of the two main unionist political parties met Thursday to discuss concerns within the unionist community. Read more: Political forum aims to stem N.Ireland violence Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year. The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic. The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured.	1
(Billboard)The key to rock's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance. So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday ̵ — not to mention a few "It's time to die" chants — it was clear that what was most significant was that "Black Sabbath" hadn't gone anywhere.It's easy to get excited when someone becomes a member of the Rock Hall, a hall that serves as one of the most important symbols of our culture. As such, there is often a lot of talk about the kind of history they will put on display when they are inducted. And since "Black Sabbath" was a band that had one foot in the world of rock and roll as well as the world of the arts, that made it seem like they had an especially full history when they were inducted.Of course, you don't have to go far back to find the "lost" guitarist of a rock band. Or the drummer who played the drums. Or the singer who sang in a band. And that's what was happening with Sabbath, a band who broke the mold of the blues form and helped usher in a unique sound that would change music forever.They were the first band. The first to incorporate a full band, songwriting from all the members and a sound that sounded both rock and metal. They were the first with a song that was written as a whole and not just on one single guitar part. And they were the first band to take their music on the road in a touring bus that didn't need to be plugged in. It allowed them to play and tour without any of the problems that touring with a band like Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden or Black Sabbath sometimes brought."Black Sabbath" wasn't the first band that defined themselves with a full band, songwriting and a new sound. There were bands that emerged in the 1960s and had a similar sound, but there was not the same sense of rock-n-roll history or longevity. The Rolling Stones and The Beatles were the first band that established that for a generation of fans. But "Black Sabbath" was the first band to take it one step further and build on it. They didn't just get something that worked, they made something that never felt like they were an experiment. And they set the groundwork for a new rock and roll tradition	0

December 16, 2014 was a dark day, not just in our nation's history, but the world's. Young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in Peshawar along with their teachers. It shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years, to a whole new level. Naturally, I was in no less despair. Hailing from a humble background, where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives, the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply. READ MORE: Bloodstains, bullet holes mark Peshawar classrooms I canceled my tours and concerts and couldn't gather myself to do much in coming weeks. However, being an artist, I had to express myself; even more so because I have always believed that an artist should be more than a tool for his art to resonate through. He must also resonate the voice of his surroundings by being socially aware and strive to contribute to his environment for the better in whatever little or large manner that he decides for himself. I thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future. So I picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film, fashion, TV and music. I was pleasantly surprised that all of them agreed with my initiative and came on board without a second thought on such a short notice. We all got together because we all want a progressive, peaceful, tolerant and positive Pakistan. And the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every Pakistani wants the same. They just need someone to show them the way. And to me, education is the way forward. It's the the key to progress and peace. I also feel that there is a lot more to Pakistan than what the world gets to see. Pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world. A place where people sing, dance and play. Unfortunately because of an extremist minority, it is sometimes seen as an extremist country. But no society is void of extremism in one way or the other.	1
Three European nations were notified about concerns over horse meat as early as a year ago, the United Kingdom's food safety agency said Sunday. The alerts -- sent last year on February 1, February 15 and March 7 -- identified Denmark, Hungary Ã¢â‚¬â€ and Poland Ã¢â‚¬â€ as likely infected by the horse meat bacteria, E. coli 0157:H7.The three countries have been informed that they are infected by E. coli 0157, which is common in beef, but rare under routine conditions.In an additional alert, the UK Food Standards Agency said it was investigating an outbreak of E. coli 0157 on three cattle farms in Scotland, where live cattle were slaughtered between March 26 and April 3.As of Sunday, the three infected countries have announced no cases of the disease, a Food Safety Authority spokesman said.But the UK Food Standards Agency said it had been notified by the Danish, Hungarian and Polish food safety authorities of findings on the beef meat that suggested that all three countries may have been exposed to the E. coli 0157:H7.All three countries have been placed on a high risk alert and have been informed that they are at risk from consuming contaminated meat, the spokesman said, adding that they have been contacted by the UK Food Standards Agency and food safety investigators.The spokesman said that all countries have been made aware that E. coli 0157:H7 can be found in meat on the premise, as well as in the processing environment.As a precautionary measure, the UK food safety agency is making samples available to UK investigators, the spokesman said.The UK Food Standards Agency has asked for public reporting of cases of E. coli 0157:H7 to help with the investigation.It has also asked affected people to eat fresh meat with the confidence that the meat is fit to eat and avoid raw meat when possible."You must ensure your food is free of known pathogens in order to protect the public," the Food Standards Agency spokesman said. "The public should be clear about how to identify if meat is fit to eat safely."Any reports of this dangerous illness should be reported immediately to the UK Food Standards Agency or the [UK Food] Authority, or the Food Standards Agency by telephone."Last Thursday, E. coli 0157	0
We hear of tremors that shake, rattle and roll, but really cause no damage. Then there are the big quakes that hit offshore and cause a scare, but nothing more. So, will the "earthquake" of the fringe parties coming in first in France, the United Kingdom, Greece and others be a tremor, or will there be damage? That now depends on whether these parties can translate their momentum into seats in their national parties. In many countries the fringe parties already have seats. In Greece, Syriza should not even be called a fringe party, though they do occupy a space in the European parliament on the far left. I'm thinking more about UKIP. Call them populist, call them fringe -- the UK's other parties must respond. For the first time in more than a century, a third party In the UK has come in front in a national election. UKIP has already had the desired effect of changing the national debate in Britain. Both Labour and the ruling Conservatives have for the past few years had to defend their policies on Europe and immigration. The Conservatives have had to move closer to UKIP's anti-EU and strong anti-immigration stance. All this before a single ballot was cast. Now, UKIP will the largest number of MEPs from Britain. But unlike many other fringe parties in Europe, UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the national parliament. Westminster is controlled by the three main parties, with a smattering of seats going to regional parties from the far reaches of the UK, and just one to the Green Party. UKIP would have to create a massive earthquake to pick up even one seat during next year's general election. But if you believe all the buzz from the elections, UKIP is about to form the next government. This reminds me of five years ago when the "Rise of the Right" in Europe was the screaming headline after the last EU Parliament election. Then most people forgot all about the EU Parliament, only for it to rise up the agenda when parliamentary expenses are criticized. The difference this time is perhaps, that the parties have gained more seats. They have the momentum. France's National Front has gone from 6% to 25% of the vote. UKIP has gone from 16% to 27%.	1
Pam Biggers, a 52-year-old woman from Hueytown, Alabama, disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle. Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.  The police in Florida claimed that Biggers was killed in an accidental electrocution during a commercial application at a power plant in Leon County.  The Leon County Coroner’s Office later admitted that Pam Biggers’ body had been cremated and that the body had been found in 2008 with a note written in her handwriting that stated, “What was once lost will be found. ” Police have also admitted that they are searching for the remains of Pam Biggers in hopes that her body would be found.On July 20, 2010, the FBI announced that they had obtained a DNA sample from William P. Biggers, Pam Biggers’ son, as a possible match to the DNA profile found in the remains.In 2011, investigators and officials with the FBI and the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that William P. Biggers was the biological father of Pam Biggers.  During a press conference, authorities announced that William P. Biggers is no longer a suspect in Pam Biggers’ disappearance.In February 2011, William P. Biggers, who is now 52 years old, was indicted on murder charges based on the theory that his daughter committed suicide.  William P. Biggers was indicted for murdering his daughter by allegedly setting her on fire after a confrontation with him, causing her death.  In August 2012, William P. Biggers was found not guilty of murder. William P. Biggers was later acquitted of another charge of felony theft against his daughter’s clothing, based on the State’s case.In October 2012, William P. Biggers, who is now 52 years old, was sentenced to life without parole.  William P. Biggers was found guilty of one of the seven charges related to his daughter’s death and was sentenced to life without parole.  The jury in this case found William P. Biggers guilty of “torture, physical abuse and deprivation and deprivation of rights under the eighth amendment.”  William P. Biggers was required to serve 65% of his sentence.

What may be the most famous religious relic of them all, the Turin Shroud, made a rare appearance on Easter Saturday -- on Italians' TV screens. One of Benedict XVI's last acts as pope, according to Vatican Radio, was to authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from Turin Cathedral, where the mysterious Christian relic is kept, out of sight, in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case. According to Vatican Radio, only once before have images of the centuries-old linen cloth been broadcast. That was in 1973, at the request of then-Pope Paul VI. Some Christians believe the shroud, which appears to bear the imprint of a man's body, to be Jesus Christ's burial cloth. The body appears to have wounds that match those the Bible describes as having been suffered by Jesus on the cross. Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the Middle Ages, when many purported biblical relics -- like splinters from Jesus' cross -- surfaced across Europe. Even the Roman Catholic Church does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of Jesus. Its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity. Archbishop of Turin Cesare Nosiglia will lead a service from the cathedral on Saturday afternoon during which the images of the shroud will be broadcast, according to Vatican Radio. A video message from Pope Francis was played as part of the broadcast. In it, he thanked God for the technological advances that have made it possible for the "Man of the Shroud" to be seen by, and reach out to, so many people. "This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart," he said. "This disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity, by war and violence which afflict the weakest ... And yet, at the same time, the face in the Shroud conveys a great peace; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty." To coincide with the television broadcast, a new Shroud 2.0 app was launched Friday. The app, released in several languages, allows users to scroll over a high-definition image of the shroud and find out more about its history and religious significance. Giulio Fanti, a professor of mechanical engineering at Padua University in Italy and co-author of the book "The Mystery of the Shroud," said the app will be "very useful" to the scientific community.	1
Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. Park officials used 10 tracking dogs to hunt for the brazen black bear, which wandered into a vernal pool at the Arataca Mountain Recreation Area in southwestern Colorado.Park authorities say the animal’s presence sparked a massive hunt for the animal, but after the dogs were dispatched all the bears that wandered into the waters were killed. Several bear sightings were reported in the area for the rest of the day.The bear’s name is a matter of public record.A mother bear called it “Shannon” after the city of Denver, which the bear had once known. The animal’s last known resting spots were near a water treatment plant in Arataca, according to local news reports.It’s not known if the bear is still alive, but if it were to be euthanized, it would be the first “bear kill” at Arataca since 1976.It’s unknown when the bear killed the teenager or his family.The boy, who has been in the hospital since the Friday attack, is recovering.This post was updated after the initial story was published to include the bear’s last known resting place.Related posts:Police: Mother bear killed son in Colorado park, ate itBear mauling victim’s father calls for end to bear huntsMother bear eats son in Colorado park, family saysBear mauls 2-year-old son, mauls his mother in Colorado parkBear mauls family in Colorado park, family saysBear mauls 2-year-old son, mauls his mother in Colorado parkBear mauls family in Colorado park, family saysBear mauls 2-year-old son, mauls his mother in Colorado parkBear mauls family in Colorado park, family saysBear mauling victim’s father calls for end to bear huntsBear attacked in Colorado park, family saysBear mauled, killed in Colorado park, family saysBear mauled, killed in Colorado park, family saysBear killed in Colorado park, family saysBear m	0
The military's top brass went into damage control mode Friday after a picture of an elite Marine unit posing with a flag symbol that is similar to a Nazi "SS" logo surfaced on the Internet a day earlier. First, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta erye-day disclosed that the flag's origins are uncertain because an inquiry is still underway. He also defended the flag.Panetta also defended the flag in his weekly radio interview with "American Morning" host George Stephanopolous."We have very fine soldiers out there who want to be proud of this, who want to be proud of the flag that they serve for and protect," he said. "And I have seen that in all of my interactions with them. And we're not going to dishonor them, we're not going to dishonor our Armed Forces."Panetta, who was joined by Air Force Secretary Michael Donley, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker, and Navy Adm. Mike Mullen at a hearing at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, said there is no need to worry about the image appearing on the Internet."I don't think it's going to hurt us," he said. "I really hope it doesn't hurt us. It does not. Our reputation is not what it is today and what it will be in 10 years."Panetta's defense of the flag is in sharp contrast to the administration's response when the Flag-Concealing Banners Act was introduced in the House by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Tex.House Republicans said that the flag's use promotes Nazi ideology. The law, which would prohibit flag-toting soldiers from wearing the emblem on their uniforms, has already been approved by the House by a vote of 205-173, with three House Democrats backing the effort. It also has the support of the Senate by a vote of 74-18.The flag's use by members of the military is an "extreme violation of our core values," McCaul said in a news release Friday morning. "As a former commissioned officer and a Navy SEAL, I know what it means to serve with and stand guard over the flag. I am deeply troubled by these images, which dishonor our troops and our nation. Our military should stand proud of the great sacrifices it makes for America, not hide behind Nazi symbols."McC	0
The number of cases of E. coli stemming from a county fair in North Carolina has grown to 38, including one child who died, the state's department of Public Safety says.The latest cases include five adults, a child and two teenagers, state police said Monday.Investigators believe the outbreak started when an adult ate food at a county fair in Henderson County. The county fair is closed until at least Wednesday, spokesman Tim Hogue said."There may be other cases that we'll learn about as people make their way to the fairgrounds," he said. "For now, this is not indicative of something that's widespread throughout the state."State health officials are investigating the E. coli outbreak. They have not identified a specific source or common factor that caused the illness.More information is at the state health department website.E. coli is a bacteria that can cause serious, sometimes fatal, intestinal problems, most often in young children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of E. coli can include diarrhea, vomiting, cramping and stomach pains.Public health officials recommend that pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immune systems monitor their drinking water for E. coli contamination."This is a particularly scary situation as we see the number of people falling ill grow across the state," Hogue said.The state health department is taking calls and emails about the outbreak at http://www.nc.gov/ncb1201/index.html.--This report was sent from NewsCenter 4 at WNCN, the WNCN-TV NewsChannel 4's news bureau in Raleigh.10:25 p.m. — A woman tells WNCN she believes this is the largest E. coli outbreak in the state's history and she has been worried about her two young children for nearly a week.A Henderson County woman who spoke on condition of anonymity said she was recently home from work when she noticed a bad odor coming from her fridge."I didn't know what it was at first," the woman said. "When I opened up my fridge, the kitchen was the same bad odor I smelled when I returned home from work."A couple of days later she noticed a "very bad" odor in her sink, she said.She began to search the Internet and discovered a local radio report	0
Initial tests on the flight data recorder recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 show that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation  agency, CNA-Avia. CNA-Avia also reported that the accident occurred after the plane had lost pressure in its hydraulic system and it's assumed that Lubitz was trying to increase the aircraft's speed by deliberately using the control yokes to "push" the control column.Lubitz's co-pilot, Dimitrios Vellidis, has been cleared of any wrongdoing, the agency reported.The findings further point to an indication that the plane's right wing was found to be too high and the left wing apparently over-corrected in the final moments of the flight. The German aviation regulator said Thursday that the German and French regulators are closely examining the data and that there was no evidence at the time that the pilot's actions may have contributed to the crash."The fact that it was a complete reversal in altitude is not necessarily evidence of this kind, but it does represent a risk which we have not detected with our systems. But we have examined the data all the same, as is standard procedure when a plane passes below 1,500 ft without any indication of a deviation," CNA-Avia chief Jacques Beauchamp said.The investigation into the French air accident authority, known as Avia, found that the plane's angle of attack (AoA) was reduced after it had lost pressure and that the pilots did not have the means to deal with the situation. The regulator also claimed that there was no sign of the flight data recorder from the left side of the cockpit, suggesting that the co-pilot was looking straight ahead during the flight, but was in fact looking down the wing to see if the plane was accelerating.Read moreSpeaking to Germany's Bild tabloid, the head of France's aviation authority, Edouard de Vincenzi, said that data from the flight data recorder recovered from the wreckage showed that the plane's flight recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were simultaneously recording, suggesting that the co-pilot's actions may have contributed to the crash."There was a risk the plane could overshoot to the right of the runway in a violent maneuver," de Vincenzi told the magazine.

A defiant Evo Morales was back in Bolivia on Thursday, railing against the United States after his presidential jet was held up in Europe under suspicions that U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden had hitched a ride. France, Spain, Eduardo Gamarra was a member of the Peruvian Air Force and shot at the American flag from 10,000 feet up.A Bolivian Air Force F-4 fighter jet crashed in the Andes on Thursday, killing all four pilots and the two civilians who were in the cockpit. The pilot's ejection seat malfunctioned, forcing an emergency landing in the mountains of southern Peru, forcing the pilot to parachute and die. The Bolivian pilot, Evo Morales, was unhurt and survived the crash and was rushed to a hospital in Lima.The air force said the crash happened around 12:45 p.m. in the area of Colquitt. The army said the plane was carrying the Peruvian president, Evo Morales, a cabinet minister, Evo Gonzalez-Avella, and an aide.Two army pilots were killed. One pilot was identified as Roberto Martínez, president of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Peruvian Armed Forces. The other was identified as Miguel Angel Paez, an aide to the president.Morales, who was president of Bolivia from 2006 until he was forced out of office earlier this year, appeared on Peruvian television channel TV Punto  on Thursday and criticized the U.S. for what he saw as a "deliberate attack" on Bolivia.Morales said in a statement posted on Facebook that he was going to Washington to complain about the plane's disappearance.The plane took off from La Paz Air Base, Bolivia, and flew east into the Andes mountain range. A source in the Bolivian aviation ministry told CNN the plane, a single-engine Cessna 172, was heading to the Andes region.A video has emerged on social media of the crash on the side of a road."I'm going to tell them who's the criminal. The criminal is the U.S. president," said Morales, who is serving his second term as president.The Bolivian president said he was in Lima, Peru, to receive medical treatment when he was evacuated for treatment in a Lima hospital.

As little Tatyana Larbi, aka Little Miss Muffett, sings about selling her cotton and twigs to the "sister pigs," you can tell the young girl is enjoying her moment in the limelight, even if she can't see the audience's response. The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence. The set and costumes are pretty basic. Most were made by parents and volunteers. But that doesn't matter to the beaming mothers, fathers and grandparents in the audience. The fact that these 10 children are performing this day is enough for them. All of the actors in the Pumpkin Pickle Pop Cookies Opera are visually impaired 4- and 5-year-olds. Two are blind, and the others have varying degrees of sight. All are students in Atlanta's Center for the Visually Impaired BEGIN program. But today is their last day here, and performing this 20-minute opera is their "thank you" to their families.  Watch an awe-inspiring opera performance » "These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program. She is very aware of the efforts that both the children and the parents put into the program. "They have to give up vacation time from their jobs," she said. "Some people travel two and three hours once a week to get here." McComiskey says the program works with newborns, sometimes only days old, up to 5-year-olds. It helps parents understand what is possible for their visually impaired or blind children. "First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child," she said. "Because some 90-odd percent of learning comes through your vision, we have to teach mommy and daddy how to do what they would do typically, a little differently." She says with the infants, it can be even more basic. "With a newborn, you're teaching them about their body. A lot of kids don't know they have feet. They have never seen them." All of the children go to the center one day a week. The BEGIN program, which is an acronym for Babies Early Growth Intervention Network, was started in 1985 and has about 95 children go through the program each year. The course costs $250 to register, but financial assistance is available.	1
A national poll suggests that nearly three-quarters of all Americans support the plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, even though most respondents said they think the troop movements will lead to an increase in violence in that country. A U.S. soldier plays soccer with children in mid-June in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll comes Tuesday, the day of the long-anticipated deadline for American troops to pull out of Iraqi towns and cities. The U.S. military gradually has been moving its combat troops out of Iraq's population centers for months to meet the deadline agreed to by Washington and Baghdad. Since January, Americans have handed over or shut down more than 150 bases across the country, leaving U.S. troops in a little more than 300 locations that gradually will be handed over to Iraqi control. The United States has pulled about 30,000 troops out of Iraq since September, leaving about 131,000 troops there. The Iraqi government describes Tuesday's pullout as National Sovereignty Day.  Watch Iraqis celebrate the transition » Seventy-three percent of Americans questioned in the poll favor the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, with 26 percent opposed. "This plan has widespread bipartisan support," said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. "Seventy-two percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans favor this move." The poll indicates that 52 percent think the level of violence in Iraqi cities will increase after U.S. troops withdraw, with 32 percent saying things will remain the same and 15 percent saying the level of violence will decrease. If violence does increase, the poll suggests Americans are clear about how to respond: "Nearly two-thirds say that the U.S. should not send combat troops back into Iraqi population centers, even if there is a significant increase in the number of violent attacks," Holland said. "Americans seem to believe that once the Iraqis are in charge, it's up to them to solve any future problems." The war in Iraq remains unpopular, with about one-third of the public supporting U.S. efforts there. The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, with 1,026 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. More than 4,300 Americans have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion.	1
Thousands gathered in the Cuban capital on Sunday to pay their respects to one of Cuba's few remaining original revolutionaries, Juan Almeida, who according to state media died of a heart attack Friday evening. Cubans wait Sunday at Havana's Revolution Plaza to pay respects to deceased Cuban revolutionary Juan Almeida. A single column of people stretched around Havana's Revolution Square in a well-coordinated show of solidarity and remembrance during what state media reported as a national day of mourning. President Raul Castro and other top government officials were reportedly on hand, though elder brother and former Communist leader Fidel Castro -- not seen in public since abdominal surgery in 2006 -- did not make an appearance. Almeida, 82, fought alongside Fidel Castro and was among only a handful of surviving Cuban leaders who still bore the title "Commander of the Revolution." Watch as Cubans remember Juan Almeida » Widely admired among Cuban nationals, Almeida participated in the failed attacks on the Moncada army barracks in 1953. He was aboard the famed yacht "Granma," that carried the small group of Cuban rebels who would later topple U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. A vice president and member of the Communist government Central Committee, Almeida was among only a few black leaders in top government posts. "This shows how we're all participants in our revolution and there is nothing that sets you apart," said Havana resident Fernando, who declined to give his last name. "Not color, nor religion," he added. Almeida's death underscores the mortality of an aging cast of Cuba's revolutionary leaders. Widespread speculation surrounding the health of Fidel Castro grew in 2006 after he underwent abdominal surgery and later ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul. The elder Castro recently surfaced in a series of photos and video looking healthier, though he has not appeared in public in over three years.	1
A decorated U.S. soldier who died while unsuccessfully trying to rescue his daughters from their burning North Carolina home was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. The funeral took place, as scheduled, in the early morning, said cemetery spokeswoman Jennifer Lynch. Chief Warrant Officer II Edward Duane Cantrell, 36, was a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. The Green Beret had returned in August from his latest overseas deployment. His wife, Louise, told officials the family was upstairs when the fire broke out just before 2 a.m. March 5 in Hope Mills, a suburb of Fayetteville. She jumped from a second-floor window and ran next door to call for help while her husband went to get  6-year-old Isabella and 4-year-old Natalia, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said. "They never made it out," said Debbie Tanna, spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office. Officials believe the family's century-old home had tinderbox conditions that led to "a very intense fire." Military officials said the Fort Bragg soldier had completed six deployments, including one to Iraq and five to Afghanistan. He had four Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart for his service, according to the Army Special Operations Command. Cantrell was honored with a military funeral at the cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. "That was his wishes," said Lt. April Olsen of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. His two daughters will lie beside him.	1
Saudi Arabia's health minister was the first person in the country to receive the H1N1 vaccination Saturday in a televised event aimed at calming ills like the global flu pandemic that has killed more than 36,000 people.Health Minister Abdullah Al-Hammour told reporters that those who have the anti-virus and anti-flu vaccine, should be seen at the nearest public health centre."Anybody who is interested in vaccinating themselves should go to the nearest health centre, otherwise we hope for the best," Al-Hammour said during the televised event Saturday night.The H1N1 influenza strain emerged in Mexico in April, making it the first flu virus to break into the U.S. since 2009. The virus has been traced to Mexico, and authorities were looking into the possibility that it could reach the U.S.Mexico's health minister has said the case is being treated as a public health emergency.U.S. health officials have called for Americans to get annual flu vaccinations, but a number of states have refused to comply, saying they have not been told by the federal health department to get them.President Obama on Thursday said that while he supports the decision to refuse the vaccines, he was frustrated with a lack of action by the federal government."I've said from the outset that if we just keep doing what we're doing, we're going to see a lot more people die," Obama said.The flu vaccine is available in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., but Canadians would have to get their shots in Mexico.The vaccine, made by GlaxoSmithKline, protects against the strains of flu that cause the most deaths — H1N1 and H3N2.Al-Hammour said the ministry has been able to vaccinate more than 400,000 people and expects to be able to vaccinate 600,000 in the coming weeks.He said it was not the government's job to force people to get the vaccine."It is up to each person, and each person decides, according to his own conscience, whether he gets vaccinated," he said.H1N1 vaccination rally a successH1N1 vaccine rally in front of the ministry in Mecca, Saudi ArabiaThousands of people in a city near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, gathered to	0
Ever had the urgent need to tag the Coke can you're holding in that beach picnic picture on Facebook? Well, now you can, as the social network has added the ability to tag Pages in Facebook photos. Starting Wednesday (although the feature does not appear to be live yet), users will be able to tag Pages for Brands & Products as well as People (more options coming soon) in their Facebook photos. Mashable.com: Facebook to help users burned by Profile-to-Page migration Tagged photos will appear in the Photos tab of a Page, rather than on that Page's Wall, and anyone can tag a Page -- even if a user hasn't "Liked" it. Page admins can also nix photos from the tab by going into Edit Page > Posting Options > and unchecking "Users can add photos." For those who concerned about their privacy, Facebook assures us that privacy settings will still apply; if your photos are visible to everyone, everyone will be able to see the tagged snap, and if your photos are set to "only friends," only friends will be able to check out that pic of you standing in front of the local Rite Aid. Mashable.com: Facebook's new Anti-Bullying Tools create a "Culture of Respect" This move could definitely be beneficial to certain brands. Imagine if people started tagging themselves wearing, say, Levi's jeans. All of those snaps would then go to the Levi's Facebook Page and result in free advertising.

The three largest U.S. cellular carriers by subscribers sell the latest iPhone, and next week, eighth-place C Spire Wireless will join the group. Some people were taken aback this week when C Spire, which only has stores in Mississippi, Southwest Alabama and Southwest Tennessee, announced that it will begin carrying the iPhone 4 and 4S on November 11. Among those grumbling over the news were some of T-Mobile USA's 33.6 million subscribers. How, they asked, could a regional carrier get the coveted product before one of the big four? C Spire's infrastructure is based on a cell standard used by Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, which now both have the iPhone, but it is not common in other countries. C Spire, formerly Cellular South, has a deal with Verizon so that customers who travel outside of its Mississippi home base can still make calls. Since C Spire's network uses the same underpinnings and antenna bands as Verizon, Apple did not have to make modifications to its phones beyond what it already did for Verizon when it launched there in February. An Apple spokeswoman confirmed that C Spire would begin selling the phone next week, but she did not respond to a question about whether the company needed to modify the hardware. The iPhone 4S, Apple's newest gadget, uses a special antenna receiver from Qualcomm that works on typically incompatible networks. "IPhone 4S is now a world phone, so both GSM and CDMA customers can roam worldwide on GSM networks," Bob Mansfield, Apple's head of hardware engineering, says in a promotional video. T-Mobile's network runs on the global standard called GSM. AT&T Mobility also uses GSM. That's what makes T-Mobile an attractive takeover target for AT&T, which plans to bolster its own network using T-Mobile cell towers, as long as the merger is approved. (C Spire, along with Sprint, are suing to block the acquisition, saying it will reduce competition.) While AT&T and T-Mobile use the same basic network infrastructure, their cell signals operate on different antenna bands. That prevents T-Mobile from easily making iPhones run on its network. When asked why C Spire got the iPhone before T-Mobile, Brad Duea, a T-Mobile senior vice-president, smiled, having likely fielded the question before.	1
Some Christians in Iraq's capital were considering leaving, following a wave of bombings targeting members of their religion that left two dead and 16 others wounded. "I am 60 years old and I gave a lot to this country, but this tough situation is like a message asking me to leave my country," said Kiyour Kizarab, the male head of a Christian family whose house was targeted Thursday in central Baghdad. "If these attacks will continue, and the government can't stop them, then I don't think we will have a future here." The strikes appeared to be coordinated because they all took place within an hour, an Interior Ministry official said. Explosives were left outside and in the gardens of 14 homes in six neighborhoods across Iraq's sprawling capital. Among the homes targeted by improvised explosive devices was one Muslim dwelling that was picked because it had a Christmas tree inside, the male head of the family, Ibrahim Sharba, told CNN. The assaults mirrored the early-morning bombings of Christian homes in Baghdad on November 10. There were two explosions in the east, in New Baghdad; two in Yarmouk; six in the central Baghdad district of Karrada; two in the southern region of Dora; and one each in al-Saydia and Al-Ameriya, the official said. The violence is the latest targeting the Christian minority in Iraq, which has a predominantly Muslim population. One of the deadliest attacks came October 31, when militants stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, in Baghdad. Some 70 people died and 75 others, including 51 congregants and two priests, were wounded. The violence has prompted a "slow but steady exodus" of thousands of Christians from Baghdad and Mosul, the U.N. refugee agency said recently. Before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, Christians were estimated to number 1.4 million in Iraq, but the violence and persecution that followed drove nearly half of them out. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Baghdad and Mosul Christians have headed to other destinations in Iraq, including the Kurdish region and the Nineveh Plains, which have a strong Christian presence.	1
On April 15, the Boston Red Sox won an early-season game at Fenway Park in dramatic, walk-off fashion in the bottom of the ninth inning. About 30 minutes later, that win -- and baseball in general -- ceased to matter; the Boston Marathon -- a sports-crazed city's most exalted annual sporting event -- had just been bombed by terrorists. Nearly six months to the day later, the Red Sox needed some Game 2 inspiration after an uninspired performance against the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. They only needed to look to the pre-game ceremonies Sunday night, when 7-year-old Jane Richard stood on her new prosthetic leg before a sellout crowd and poignantly sang the National Anthem. Singing in front of nearly 40,000 people made her strong, but the circumstances that brought her there made her Boston Strong. Jane, who lives in the city's Dorchester neighborhood, didn't just lose her leg in the Boston Marathon terror attacks. She lost her big brother, 8-year-old Martin, as well. She underwent 12 surgeries and spent months recovering in Boston hospitals. When she was finally discharged, the Richard family issued an update that coincided with the bombing's four-month mark. "Jane continues to be an incredible source of inspiration -- and exhaustion," the August 15 statement read. "The loss of her leg has not slowed her one bit, or deterred her in any way." Fenway Park is barely a David Ortiz home run away from the marathon's finish line in Copley Square where the bombs went off and changed the city forever. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, Ortiz hit a late-inning home run to tie a game that the Red Sox would later win in dramatic, walk-off fashion in the bottom of the ninth inning. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, that win mattered. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, baseball mattered again.	1
A class action lawsuit against Instagram has been filed in San Francisco federal court, following user outrage regarding the mobile photo sharing app's changed Terms of Service. This appears to be the first civil lawsuit filed as a result of Instagram's service term changes, Reuters reports. Lucy Funes, a California Instagram user, claimed breach of contract, among other things, on behalf of herself and others similarly affected. The lawsuit was filed Friday despite Instagram reverting some of the clauses it had announced it would change. "In short, Instagram declares that 'possession is nine-tenths of the law and if you don't like it, you can't stop us,'" the lawsuit says. Mashable has reached out to Facebook, the company that now owns Instagram, for comment, and will update this story should Facebook respond. Instagram Vows: We Won't Use Your Photos in Ads Last week, Instagram announced that it had changed its TOS, which spurred widespread outrage from users and celebrities -- National Geographic even shut down its account, though it's now posting again. The new rules suggested Instagram would sell users' photos without compensation and introduced a mandatory arbitration clause, which would force users to waive their rights to file a class action lawsuit in most circumstances. Following the user response, CEO Keving Systrom retracted the new clause about using photos without compensation. Instagram maintained the mandatory arbitration clause as well as a clause saying it will display ads based on user content. Are you still upset with Instagram? Let us know in the comments if you think Funes' case has merit.	1
Despite a shared passion for food, we come from very different backgrounds. To look at us, you might not think we have much in common; one of us is a veteran Marine from New Orleans, the other a tattooed New Yorker with Mexican roots. But  I love food, he loves books. One morning he asked me if I wanted to try out for his book club. I didn't even know what a book club was. I told him that I didn't know any books, but I'd love to try out.A few months later, he walked into my bookstore with a copy of his book, _New Orleans Cookbook_ , and he told me to read it. I read it, and it blew me away. I had just met him, but I felt a kinship with him because he was a writer. I'd always wanted to write, and reading his book was the start of my writing career.It doesn't matter that the two of us are very different: we both love food. We go to the same restaurants, to the same parties, to the same festivals, we both like to cook, and we both love books.We're always together when I visit the island, and we spend a lot of time together in New Orleans. Every now and then, I have a friend who lives in the city and comes visit me on the island. He's a chef and he makes my favorite thing, chicken and dumplings, and he's a great cook. Whenever he comes, we catch up, and he tells me all about his life and his work. He knows the city really well. Some months he's here for only a few days, then he leaves, never to return to the city. What he sees and what he feels when he's here are sometimes completely different from what I see and how I feel.One day we were chatting about the other things we love in the city, and I told him about my food love, and my love of cooking, and we decided to start a group of people who love food the same way we do. The idea is to bring together people who love food the same way we do. We get together every weekend in a different setting, like a restaurant, a museum, a food hall, a park, and we cook and share recipes. I wanted to be a chef, so it all started with that.

The United States ambassador to Afghanistan, William Wood, said Friday that changes in communications with Afghan military forces have been made in the aftermath of a disputed U.S. air raid on an Afghan village. Civilians are overcome with emotion outside a home destroyed by a U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan. And despite Afghanistan's outrage over the loss of life, he said, the incident has not undermined the nations' relationship. The Afghanistan government has said that as many as 90 civilians -- including many children -- were killed in the August 22 air attack on a village in the Shindand district of Western Afghanistan. The United States had said that only seven civilians died, along with dozens of insurgents. A number of investigations into the incident are under way, including a "senior level" review by the United States. "People who are reviewing our findings have been in Afghanistan for a while, and I don't know when they will complete their review," Wood said at the State Department late Friday. "There is no American involved who doesn't feel a personal sense of pain and regret any time any civilian casualty occurs," he said. "Speaking as an official of the American government, I can say there is no one who works harder than the United States does to minimize such casualties. "I know as a matter of absolute certainty of operations that have been canceled precisely because there was a risk of civilian casualties," he added. "I think there is no question there has been what one Afghan official referred to as 'sort of a bumpy time' over this issue in the last few weeks. I think that it has never threatened the underlying relationship of confidence between our two countries and between our peoples or between our military and the people of Afghanistan. "That said, we are certainly committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure that such casualties are reduced to the absolute minimum and to working closely, even more closely, with the Afghan government to successfully carry out the military mission." The ambassador said the United States has made changes in communication between the U.S. and Afghan forces. "Steps are already not simply under way but have been taken to improve coordination," he said. U.S. and Afghanistan officials have just completed a new round in what is called the United States-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership. A joint U.S.-Afghanistan statement released Thursday referred to the attack.	1
A federal judge ruled Monday that Chicago's ban on virtually all sales and transfers of firearms is unconstitutional. "The stark reality facing the City each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun. But on the other side of this case is another feature of government: certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution, put outside government's reach, including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment,"  wrote U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang. "Chicago's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms," he continued. Chang explicitly did not rule out other types of regulation, short of a complete ban, in order to "minimize the access of criminals to firearms and to track the ownership of firearms. "But the flat ban on legitimate sales and transfers does not fit closely with those goals," Chang wrote. 'It's got to stop,' grandmother says after 3-year-old injured in Chicago shooting The judge stayed his ruling to give the city time to file an appeal. The FBI's latest annual crime report showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. Still, Chicago does not have the highest homicide rate in the United States. That unwanted distinction belongs to Flint, Michigan, with one homicide for every 1,613 residents, according to the FBI data. Detroit is close behind, with one killing for every 1,832 residents.

Imprisoned Ukrainian opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has ended her 12-day hunger strike, Ukraine's Batkivschyna opposition party said Friday. Tymoshenko's daughter, Eugenia Tymoshenko, visited her mother at the prison where she is held in Kharkov, according to the party. Eugenia said after her visit that her mother is "very weak now; she almost does not get up from bed. This is because it is her third hunger strike in a short period of time." Eugenia said many people, including European and world leaders, had asked her mother to stop the hunger strike, according to the Batkivschyna party. But her mother's decision followed a request by protesters who have been demonstrating in Kiev's Independence Square for Ukraine's integration with the European Union, her daughter told the party. "She stopped her hunger strike upon the request of the people on the square. They asked her to take care of her life, her health, so she could be with us," Eugenia Tymoshenko said. The government of President Viktor Yanukovich suspended talks with the European Union last month, angering many Ukrainians who say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. The subsequent protests are the biggest in Ukraine since the so-called Orange Revolution nine years ago, a populist movement that toppled the government. The battle over Ukraine: Toward a new geopolitical game About 7,000 people were protesting in the capital, Kiev, as of Friday morning, police said. The crowds often swell in size in the evenings as people leave work and join the protest. While many have been demonstrating in Independence, or Maidan, Square, others have rallied outside the Cabinet Office, the presidential office and other government offices. Larger rallies are planned for the weekend. Chief among Yanukovich's reasons for backpedaling on the EU talks was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead. Yanukovich was also facing an EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: free Tymoshenko, his chief political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power.	1
A crowd gathered Thursday for an emotional funeral in Manhattan's St. Thomas Church, where hundreds paid their respects to three young girls who died in a house fire in Stamford, Illinois, last June and were laid to rest Thursday.In the days following the girls' deaths, local media outlets reported on rumors alleging they had been abused by their mother."I can't imagine the grief that they're going through," said Pastor George O'Connor, who attended the funerals with his wife, Patricia. "They're going to be mourning now for a long time."The three young girls — aged 10 months to 4 years — died in the fire of their family's home outside Stamford, Illinois, on June 2, 2012. Their mother, Shaneka Miller, was charged with three counts of aggravated arson in the teens' deaths, which also injured seven other people, including three firefighters, in the city's second-largest firehouse.Miller, who is expected to be arraigned on March 7 in the death of her three daughters, declined comment Thursday, and a lawyer for Miller had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.But in an Oct. 11 criminal complaint, Miller alleged that her three daughters, all under age 4, died from "suffocation" and that their bodies were kept indoors and smothered because her estranged husband, Stephen Miller, threatened to kill his family if she didn't keep them warm. Miller, who had been separated from her husband for about 18 months, said she had called the family's home three times to check on her children. That's when she heard the screaming.The next day, the family had begun to prepare for the fire, but that night, Stephen Miller allegedly broke into their home and set it on fire, with the girls still inside. Authorities said Miller had admitted to starting the fire.In early 2013, Shaneka Miller was charged with three counts of aggravated arson by a judge in Cook County, Illinois, based on an extensive search warrant that was executed at the family's home in the hours after the fire. Police said they found two bodies, with Shaneka Miller initially saying they were her daughters. Police later said they found a third girl, 11-month-old Ava Miller. The complaint said that Shaneka Miller admitted to setting the fire, and that she had asked her daughter in the days leading up to the fire	0
Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, or the "Snow Leopard" as he has been dubbed, is making his final preparations for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A skier preparing to take part in the Games at this point in the calendar is not the most sensational news, until it is understood the 31-year-old grew up in Accra, Ghana (where the annual average temperature is around 79 degrees Fahrenheit) and learnt to ski only six years ago on a dry slope. Nkrumah-Acheampong hopes his remarkable and unconventional rise to prominence -- he achieved the strict qualifying criteria set by the world governing body of his sport from his training base at an artificial snow dome in Milton Keynes, England, where he was a former employee -- can act as inspiration to his countrymen. "The response that I get from emails and phone calls, that more people are going to come into snow sports, that's what I'm hoping to achieve and 10 years from now Ghana should have a ski racer who is 10 times better than me," he told CNN. The "Snow Leopard" first sprung to prominence after announcing his intention to qualify and compete in the downhill at the Turin Winter Olympics in 2006, despite only having taken up the sport in 2003. "It took 30 minutes for me to be able to just go in a straight line, slow myself down and stop, and the instructor who was my friend, told me: 'You know something, just go and train yourself now, just carry on.' And that's when I started falling down," he said. After becoming hooked on downhill and pleased with his natural ability he set about trying to qualify -- a feat that involved traveling around the world. He narrowly missed qualifying for the Turin-based Games but came back stronger to insure his place in Canada, an achievement the 34-year-old is exceptionally proud of. "I think it was like sending a Ghanaian to the moon, [but] apart from it being really cool -- I still wake up and still think to myself -- this is going to be really tough, people are going to be watching you -- you can't just go to the Olympics and just have fun," he added.	1
As winter storms continue to pound the United States, causing billions in damage and millions to be without electricity service, customers inevitably ask why doesn't somebody -- my utility, my regulator, my government -- do something about this? Why aren't power lines, for example, buried safely underground? It's not that simple. The short answer? It is expensive, requires the buy-in of multiple entities that serve the community and doesn't always solve the problem. Because it costs so much to bury power lines, it's crucial that the expense yields value for electricity consumers, who will ultimately bear all the costs associated with providing electricity service. It's easy to see why a community under siege by intense weather would want to put the lines underground: Underground lines are protected from wind-related damage as well as ice and snow. But they also may be more vulnerable to damage from water intrusion. They're popular, too, in densely populated areas and new subdivisions where utility poles and a plethora of overhead lines would cause a kind of overhead congestion. As of 2012, about 39% of the customers in the United States reported having underground electricity service. But going underground can be difficult: In the electric utility business in the United States, it is nearly impossible for the utility, regulator or government to address the question of changing how power is delivered without the sign-on and cooperation of the others. Frum: Why we should bury the power lines Let's start with the utility company: It is closest to the challenge, managing the electricity system, but cannot spend the money to change the power line configuration without the assurance from its regulator, whether it is the state public service commission or a city commission, that it will recover its investment through the rates it charges to its customers. For its part, the regulator cannot directly fix the power lines but still must ensure that any money the utility spends provides value for consumers. Finally, the government, or the other voice for the consumers, must determine whether consumers are willing to pay for such a change. (The state of Florida's reaction in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane seasons provides a model for this type of cooperative effort, as utilities, regulators and government officials meet every year to address the efficacy of Florida's storm hardening efforts, including the potential undergrounding of power lines.) Then there are two major challenges associated with relocating power lines underground: First, it is very expensive.	1
Every week, there's a new Facebook thing to gripe about. This week, there have been two -- and it's only Tuesday. On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was "testing" a feature that would let iphone users log in to their Facebook account using their iphone's Touch ID fingerprint reader.Now, the company has announced that if you activate the Facebook mobile app for iphone, you won't need a Facebook account to log into it, just your fingerprint.It turns out that the company has been testing the fingerprint login feature for about 18 months, and it only recently decided to allow it for those who have Facebook accounts."Some people found that the fingerprint login feature was inconvenient, especially if their Facebook accounts are on other devices," said Nick Stanton, senior director of Facebook App, in a blog post. "It's just one more way that our team was thinking about how we can better make our service more convenient. We'll continue testing and adding things that make people's lives better."That Facebook has been testing the feature for more than a year is great news for all of us. It means Facebook is now in a much better position to give users the full feature set of what Facebook can do on the iPhone that it already offers.What's great is that if you've got an iPhone and don't use Facebook on the iPhone, there's really no need to bother with adding a Facebook account to your phone. The fingerprint login feature is really only available to people who already have Facebook accounts, for obvious reasons.Stanton also noted that some people did find the fingerprint login feature too difficult to use."In the wake of this, we're listening to feedback from friends, family, and the public - and we're going to make some changes to make this easier," he said. "We've heard from you, and we're listening."The good news is that the fingerprint login feature will be available to everyone by the end of the month. You can find out more information about it, including how to enable it and enable it without a Facebook account, in the post from Stanton.Here are some other Facebook stories you might have missed this week:Facebook launches a new product that allows people to share and like books, films and music togetherFacebook launched its new photo album feature for users to view their photo	0
Three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the United States, House and Senate committees Thursday put Congress on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund operating until early next summer. But even as Republicans and Democrats drew closer together, some in the transportation industry decried the nearly $11 billion proposals as short-term fixes that leave the nation's bigger infrastructure issues untouched. House and Senate day of action Without an infusion of cash to the highway fund, the Department of Transportation has warned that road projects may have to start shutting down in August. After months of failed negotiations, key House and Senate committees passed proposals Thursday that were relatively close in scope and content. Previous drafts had differed in the source and size of funding, as well as how long that funding would last. Thursday both the Republican-led House Ways & Means Committee and the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee passed bills with the same central dollar figure, $10.8 billion. That's enough to keep the fund in business until roughly next summer. The two sides also moved closer on where to get the money. The Senate committee adopted a House idea, including something called pension smoothing, which allows employers to set aside less money for long-term pension funding. One key difference -- the House bill has a more expanded version of the money-raiser, bringing in three times as much money from pension-smoothing than the Senate. The bills are much closer on the amount of money they'd raise from an extended increase in customs fees. And they would each transfer $1 billion out of funds for underground storage leaks. Republican and Democratic senators stressed they had made compromises. Finance Chairman Ron Wyden had previously insisted on a long-term deal. "Colleagues, I want it understood that (pushing for a longer-term solution) was my position at the beginning of the negotiations," the Oregon Democrat said to his committee. "But it was clear that it would not be possible to reach a bipartisan agreement (for a longer-term deal)." His Republican counterpart echoed the story of tradeoffs. "While I won't say I've gotten everything I wanted," ranking Republican Orrin Hatch admitted, " I will say I think we've reached a deal that can satisfy both Democrats and Republicans." Differences remain	1
The player tumbles to the ground, writhing around as if he has been mortally wounded. Television replays, however, show that his opponent has made no contact at all. It's an ever-increasing sight on football grounds around the world,  especially when a player is knocked to the ground after a tackle that results in him or her being flagged offside.If a player has been injured after making contact with the ball, the rulebook doesn't allow for him to continue to play. In many cases, this means the player will be replaced by an opposition player. As a result, many stadiums are now using video technology to allow spectators to see what takes place after a tackle in the build-up to kick-off.The Football Association are in a unique position. They are the governing body for both domestic and international football—with the added complication that they have the added financial incentive of selling the broadcast rights to the global TV market. One way which football might have resisted this is for broadcasters to pay more for the rights rather than for being included in the rights package. In 2017, Sky, the UK's biggest satellite broadcaster, paid £541m for the English Premier League, one of the most valuable live rights packages on the planet.There was a long debate in 2009 about whether the FA should allow the cameras to be used on a wider scale. The issue was put to the FA's general meeting and the following debate was televised. The debate featured many of the leading footballing thinkers and was the first time the issue was raised publicly.By 2013, the FA had decided to make use of cameras on a much more widespread basis, with the aim being to see how the technology could deliver a more accurate picture of the game and improve the quality of play. It was announced the following year that the cameras would be installed on all grounds on the day of the match for the first time.The camera can be used either by the host of the match or by someone else for up to 15 minutes after the final whistle has been blown. The on-field use of the camera is voluntary and is subject to the FA's discretion, with no requirement that the cameras be used in an offensive manner.For the first 20 years, cameras could not be used for the first 20 minutes of the match. These rules had been in place since the 1966–67 season to prevent spectators from watching the game and then deciding	0
Loud music pumps through huge speakers, front row guests cheer and a parade of stunning models electrifies the gleaming catwalk -- welcome to Africa Fashion Week London. Currently in its third year, the glamorous event saw dozens of big names and up-and-coming designers from across the continent descending on the UK capital's hip district of Shoreditch to unveil their latest stylish creations. "Our platform is about promoting emerging and established Africa-inspired designers," said Ronke Ademiluyi, founder of the event, held from August 1 to 3. "The main thing is to bring attention to them, to showcase their creativity to the world so they get more global recognition for what they do and more appreciations for their brands as well." Vibrant colors The runways featured designs from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Kenya and Morocco -- but also from the diaspora, including Britain and the Caribbean. In many ways, the event reaffirmed why Africa-inspired designs are fast catching the eye of the fashion world. Mixing current trends with traditional patterns, more than 60 designers graced the catwalk with a wide array of colorful creations -- everything from show-stopping evening gowns and modern urban casualwear to bold textured prints and chic accessory lines. Glorious colors in the desert: Darfur's fashionable women Ademiluyi says the continent's fashion today "represents a fusion of contemporary and African designs" awash with "a lot of vibrant colors and tribal trends." Amongst those giving a modern twist to traditional styles is Nigerian designer Fashola Olayinka with her Lagos-based label "MOOFA Designs." Her latest collection, "Ashake" is celebrating the "very powerful and strong women" who "turn heads wherever they go to." "That's basically what's the collection is about," says Olayinka, who started the label about four years ago. "Women who are very feminine and sexy." Read this: Congo's designer dandies The young designer says that despite the existing challenges, such as frequent power cuts, it's very exciting being part of Nigeria's fashion scene right now. "We work hard and we party hard, so it's been really fun and it's a growing process in Nigeria," she says. "Nigerians like to dress up and a lot of people in Nigeria are now wearing their own fabrics."	1
In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said. The men escaped from a detention center Saturday night in Quebec City. "A helicopter iced-in, and when the door was opened a bunch of men ran out." — from Canadian Broadcasting Corp.They all came from the same family. They had one name: The Andersons.The Andersons arrived in Canada just before World War II, according to a genealogy website. They had made their fortune in the coal business, and had a house in Quebec City by the sea that became known as the Andersons' Palace.They were the most prominent and richest of a dozen Swedish families that settled in Quebec City in the 1830s. They had six brothers in all; one became an opera singer, but none stayed in the city. Most of their descendants are believed to have moved away, but one family member remained in Quebec. Now a group of men known as The Family — all related to The Andersons — are back in Quebec in a way they've never been before.On the evening of Aug. 6, the last remaining members of the group gathered at the Palace, where one of the Andersons lived. The man, who was 67, said he was the last of 11 children, six of whom remained in Quebec to help care for their mother, who had died the previous February.The Andersons' Palace was a small and rundown building, but a large, red-brick farmhouse sat nearby. In the evening hours, the men and their horses were being hidden there, and then were brought to the group's meeting place, a barn outfitted with a bar that was used for the family members' private drinking sessions. While the men would sing and dance, the bartender would pour them champagne.The group then moved to a beach in the Eastern Townships, where two of the Andersons' horses were located, and then to the ranch's stable, where a horse-drawn cart, stocked with bottles of champagne and whiskey and some ice, was waiting for them. At about 11:30 p.m., the men climbed onto their horses and rode out of the barn in the family's carriage.The horses were driven to a nearby hotel, as the group was being hunted.A local resident saw them head out, as he was walking	0
A man who crashed his plane in the Florida Panhandle in an apparent attempt to fake his death was sentenced Wednesday to more than four years in federal prison, officials said. Marcus Schrenker was accused of defrauding Â4,200 people of more than $100,000 by faking his death in the crash in December 2010.Schrenker was found guilty in December 2015 of wire fraud and tampering in a scheme he thought was over, authorities said. Authorities said he staged his death by crashing the plane, killing the pilot and his wife, then using social media to publicize his death to make it look like suicide.Authorities said Schrenker and his brother are no longer in Florida. Police in Georgia were called to Schrenkerâs home in December 2010 after receiving a call from a potential victim.

In an auction featuring memorabilia from the Beatles, Madonna and Elvis Presley, it was Michael Jackson who proved to be king. The red and black jacket, winged shoulders and all, that the late pop star wore during his zombie-ridden "Thriller" video fetched a $1.8 million bid at this weekend's Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, California, according to the auctioneer's website. The winning price was exponentially above the estimated bid of $200,000 to $400,000. Part of the proceeds will go toward the Shambala Preserve where Jackson's two Bengal tigers, Thriller and Sabu, have been living the past five years. The jacket had been given to Dennis Tompkins and Michael Bush, the singer's longtime costume designers, to use as a reference for concert performances of the "Thriller" song. It includes an inscription to them on the jacket's lining, and the sleeve is signed, "Love Michael Jackson." Its sale came exactly two years after the then 50-year-old Jackson was killed by a surgical anesthetic called Propofol, which a Los Angeles coroner ruled killed the singer in combination with several sedatives found in his blood. The jacket wasn't the only piece of history from the late King of Pop that was part of the auction. The signature fedora Jackson wore during his Bad Tour was sold for $16,250, a handwritten note to friend Elizabeth Taylor went for $5,625 and a signed pillowcase fetched $3,584. And a bidder paid out $330,000 -- more than 10 times what Julien's had expected to get -- for one of the famous, shiny, crystal-covered gloves that Jackson wore during the 1980s. "Michael Jackson has an unbelievable fan base," Darren Julien, the auction house's president, told CNN earlier this month. Other pieces of history, from other members of music royalty, were also featured at the auction. While gold records and instruments were common items, others were more practical -- like Frank Sinatra's boots (selling for $2,500) and his 1986 Jaguar car ($19,000). as well as the U.S. Army-issued sewing kit of Elvis Presley's that went for $1,536.	1
Joe Wilkins knew there was only one way to give his supercharged, alcohol-injected Hemi-engined hot rod more power: Put a jet engine in the trunk. "It started as a hobby and turned  into a business," says the owner of Hot Rod Power, a business based in the former Motor City Mall mall in south suburban South Holland. "We just couldn't find a better vehicle than this." Now, after three years of research and development, Hot Rod Power has finally built the first car to have a jet pipe engine in its trunk. And even more important, it's a car that will be able to run on regular gas without modification. "It's a jet-ready Hemi-powered hot rod," says Bill Smith, who started the business in December 1996 with three friends. "We're just not trying to sell the car."The car was originally intended to be sold as a street legal car with a V8, but when they finally had the money to build a car with no engine, they decided to stick with a Hemi because it's considered a more streetable car. The car is powered by a big-block Hemi V8 with dual intake and exhaust ports, and it can achieve an impressive 265 horsepower. It also gets an automatic transmission, power-steering, a roller-skate roof, and four-wheel disc brakes. Although the car may look like something out of a sci-fi movie, it's for real, so Wilkins said. "The engine's in there. It has a driver's seat, so when it pulls out of the water, your family can sit in there," he says. "It's got no doors, and you'll still be able to get your hands on the steering wheel."What's even more interesting about this car is that it's been built with the assistance and expertise of someone who worked as a professional carpenter before he began to work in the auto industry. "This car was built with a lot of precision," says Smith. The car was finished in a factory in Canada and delivered in May 1997. "I didn't realize the car needed to be designed to fit into the trunk. I thought it could be the engine, so I cut it off." In reality, the car's trunk was smaller because the back quarter panel had to be cut in order to create the trunk floor and to fit in four-wheel disc brakes. The	0
None of the seven doctors and one nurse investigated by the state will face criminal prosecution in the death of singer Michael Jackson, the state attorney general's office said Wednesday. But a doctor who prescribed drugs to the pop singer Â— and who was among six interviewed after the singer died last June Â— faces possible civil charges, according to prosecutors.This is not the first such case in which Jackson was being investigated. His death was the subject of a police investigation by the Los Angeles County SheriffÂ’s Department, and an internal affairs investigation by Jackson's security staff, who were also interviewed.The doctor, Dr. Michael L. Smith, said he gave Jackson, then 49, six drugs over the course of three days, including the powerful anesthetic propofol.âWhen I first saw him on the night he died, I told him, 'Man, you've got to take these and you have to call me the next day,'â Smith, a pediatrician at the University of California at Davis Medical Center, told the L.A. Times. âI gave him a drug combination and a phone number to call. He would text me the information and when I called, he was still in the ICU.âSmith told Jackson that a âdeath mask procedureâ would be performed, during which the singerâs body would be covered with a white sheet and placed on a table in a hospital âdo not resuscitateâ room, to allow for resuscitation efforts without disfiguring his body.Jacksonâs mother Katherine is among those demanding that two men she accuses of killing her son receive the death penalty. âIf what the government alleges is not proven, they should be executed,â she told the Los Angeles Times. âIf they are not sentenced of death, I will leave them to their fateâ without âthe death and destruction they have brought to me and to the people of Miami,â she said.âI would prefer that they be charged with manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide,â Katherine told	0
Past, present and future came together on a thunderstorm-filled Sunday, as President Barack Obama received an honorary doctorate and gave the commencement speech at historically black, all-male Morehouse College, where the Rev. _____ served as dean in 2009. The occasion featured a rousing recitation of the president’s African heritage, as well as a speech from Obama’s father, who addressed the issue of race and African-Americans. Obama was introduced by Morehouse’s president and senior class of 2013, while the valedictorian, senior, and student body president delivered his oration.“I think one of the most important stories to come out this year is the story of my father and the story of Barack Obama,” said Rev. Jesse Jackson in his message to the graduating class.Obama’s father recounted his own struggle to overcome racial prejudice during the civil rights movement, while his son recalled how much the current struggles against racial prejudice reminded him of his own struggles.“And when you’re a young boy, you don’t really understand how hard it was, but those days were tough and they were discouraging and they were difficult,” said Obama, who is the oldest of seven children. “The story about my father and me and our struggle to overcome is that one of the most important things you can do is to understand your privilege. And you don’t ever take it for granted. So the way to overcome that is to remember that you’ve been blessed; you’ve inherited privilege, and you have to make the most of those privileges. And it wasn’t easy.”Obama also took the opportunity to celebrate Morehouse College’s strong focus on public service, noting that Morehouse graduates have served in numerous government positions such as Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, US Senator Thad Cochran, as well as serving as a military chaplain.“And I’m proud to join the chorus of voices saying that Morehouse College is one of the finest colleges in the United States, and one of the finest schools in the world, because of the public service part of public education,” Obama said. “It’s not enough to say that America has great universities that serve our needs in academia, but it is what	0
The U.S. Defense Department on Monday identified the SEAL killed during a successful raid to free a captive doctor in Afghanistan. Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas D. Checque, 28, of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, died Saturday during the effort to free Dr. Dilip Joseph, the Navy said. NATO commanders believed Joseph was in imminent danger from his captors when the raid took place. While the Defense Department announcement said only that Checque belonged to an "East Coast-based Special Warfare Unit," a U.S. official said the man was a member of the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, more commonly known as SEAL Team Six. The elite unit is the same one that took part in the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The official didn't know if the SEAL who died was involved in that operation. "He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our nation to stay strong, safe and free," President Barack Obama said of the slain SEAL before his identity was made public. Armed men kidnapped Joseph and two other staff members for the international aid group Morning Star on Wednesday as they returned from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province. Tribal leader Malik Samad and district chief Muhammad Haqbeen told CNN that Joseph and an Afghan doctor were abducted near the village of Jegdalek in the Sarobi district, just outside Kabul. The International Security Assistance Force said Taliban insurgents kidnapped the men. Samad and Haqbeen identified the kidnappers as smugglers. Morning Star said negotiations began "almost immediately" with the captors and went on sporadically into Saturday night, when two of the three were released. The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, Haqbeen and Samad said. Morning Star denied paying any "ransom, money or other consideration" to win the release of its staffers, and the raid to free Joseph came 11 hours later after the other two were released. U.S. officials provided few details about the rescue effort, but Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the SEALs "knew they were putting their lives on the line to free a fellow American from the enemy's grip."	1
Most of us have become so used to suppressing noise that we don't think much about what we're hearing, or about how we listen. Yet our well-being is now being seriously damaged by modern sound. Here are 10 things about sound  that should concern us.The first thing you've probably learned by now: Noise is annoying. In fact, as a human being, you may even have been taught not to feel this way. After all, "noise" usually means something that's annoying. Whether because of cultural bias or because there has been no scientific evidence of any health consequences of noise exposure, we've been taught not really to hear it or to pay attention to it. We're told it's just some "noise," noise that has been generated by a "noise source" and there's nothing wrong with it. But what is noise anyway?The second thing you've probably learned about noise: It's louder at the top of our heads, in our ears, on our tables, on our smartphones, and on our TV screens. It's louder in airplanes, cars, public transportation, gym equipment, and other public spaces. When we spend much time in these places, we are exposed to an overwhelming volume of noise. So are our pets. According to a recent study by researchers at the University of Illinois: "In their studies, they documented how easily rats tolerated hearing a level of noise that humans would consider to be intolerable. Noise is a common stressor, which can lead to hypertension and heart disease in humans, as well as being associated with the development of cancer."If you've read this far, you're probably thinking, wow, that is really interesting. But then why do so many scientists still regard noise as harmless? Some of the answer is that there's a pervasive myth that a sound is just any kind of sound, and that it can't be anything but either pleasant or unpleasant. But according to a 2014 study published in the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, sound is actually composed of a wide variety of different sounds, including speech, bird song, and many others.Here are 5 of those different sounds that the brain can recognize.1. Gait and vocal soundsGait consists of walking rhythmically while producing sounds that carry the idea of motion. It's a rhythmic series of sounds that sound like footsteps, such as a clapping hand, or the "	0
Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest. Kanye West, center,  with girlfriend Amber Rose  at the MTV Video Music Awards.The rapper’s visit to the show is a good start to Tuesday’s show, which Leno describes as “a three-hour episode.”During Kanye’s interview, Leno says he expects “the best” for his guest, who’s already done “two or three” on the show, and “a hundred hours of content” on his website.But according to Leno himself, who’s been with the morning show for about six years, he doesn’t expect West to say anything particularly controversial.“I think people will watch very carefully, because I’m not going to say anything that they’ve heard about him from others, I’m not going to say the things that are said about him by people we’ve talked to in the news, or that he’s said himself in interviews where he goes on for more than five minutes,” Leno says, adding that it’s about “what does he say and what does he say differently than what he has said in the past.”That could be a problem, however, since Leno has already made sure to have a few tough subjects in store for Kanye, such as women's lib, which is something he didn’t shy away from during his interview with the Daily Mail. Leno also mentions the infamous kiss between the two over the summer, something that’s been a topic of conversation, since it happened on MTV’s Video Music Awards."My show’s about music, my show’s about comedy. I don’t know, I don’t know what to do. I have a few songs up now, but people have been writing me about that kiss and a few others," Kanye tells Leno on Tuesday's show. "That’s what the show is about. I’m not going to be the guy that comes in here and says, 'Hey, I did this, I did that, I did this, I did that	0
A seventh minute goal from Brazilian teenager Alexander Pato proved enough to give AC Milan a 1-0 home victory over Fiorentina in a match totally dominated by Manchester City's $150 million bid for playmaker Kaka this week. Pato (right) and David Beckham celebrate Milan's only goal at the San Siro on Saturday evening. The goal was created by David Beckham who beat two defenders to a loose ball. He poked it back to Marek Jankulovski who played in Pato inside the penalty area. There still appeared no danger to the Fiorentina goal, but Pato hit a stunning strike from the left that went in off the far post. Fiorentina should have equalized on 66 minutes when Juan Vargas got to the byline and crossed to Mario Santana but the Argentine put his shot too close to goalkeeper Christian Abbiati who managed to save. The result leaves Milan in third place on 37 points, six points behind leaders and city rivals Inter, who have a game in hand. Jose Mourinho's side travel to Atalanta on Sunday. Jankulovski collected a late red card for timewasting, but Milan held on to secure the three points. Meanwhile, Milan supporters made their opposition to the Kaka bid, and his possible departure, perfectly clear throughout the match -- unveiling a host of banners and singing songs pleading with the Brazilian to stay at the San Siro. Reggina remain deep in relegation trouble after suffering a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Siena. Mario Frick's goal 15 minutes from time was enough to give the Bianconeri three points which sees them leapfrog Sampdoria and move up to the relative comfort of 14th spot. Siena in contrast, stay second from bottom and could slip to the foot of the Serie A standings if Chievo beat Napoli on Sunday.	1
When Billy Beane, the subject of the 2004 book 'Moneyball', took over as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in the late 1990s, he revolutionized the way baseball teams were run. At a time when other managers and scouts relied on their experience to  determine what players were worth using as a resource, he decided to look at a player's entire value chain. He made the decision that a player's value was derived from both his on-field and his off-field. It's a decision baseball teams have made since -- and it is the reason why baseball teams have so many stars, and which has given us the likes of Aaron Judge, J. D. Martinez, Andrew McCutchen, Yordan Alvarez and so many more. As a result of his decision-making, Beane's Athletics became the first team to make the playoffs in back-to-back seasons in over 40 years.Last week, just the fifth time in Beane's tenure that his team made the playoffs after leading all American League teams in runs scored the previous season, MLB and the A's announced a multi-year extension for the league's all-time leader in wins, and best winning percentage. The A's have now earned seven more victories than Beane's previous record, which stood between the Yankees and Red Sox. With that said, let's take a look at the team's most recent championship run, and how Beane has helped make it all possible.How Did This All Start?In 1996, the Oakland A's won the World Series for the first time since 1963, when the team came from behind to beat the New York Yankees in Game 7. For years, after winning the AL West, the Oakland A's had been on the outside looking in at the playoffs. However, in 1997, both the American League and National League went to an interleague schedule, eliminating the A's from the wild card. At the same time, the Athletics were not only under .500, but in the bottom half of the league.The A's had a lot of talent and with Beane, he decided to make some small changes. Instead of spending most of their time on the field, they spent their time in the dugout and as the manager, they decided to use that time to evaluate the roster and look for ways to improve their team.A Beane-Determined ApproachOne of those places	0
As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is "mad, frustrated and angry." Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate,  but frustrated at the chaos and public relations issues that have emerged. Furious that he has been "left twisting in the wind" on a major issue that he has been working on for months. Frustrated about the fact that his aides and allies in Congress have been unable to resolve the problems.For more on the Obamacare website meltdown and the role of the White House in the chaos, see "The White House Sparring with its Conservative Opponents," by Ben Domenech.This article previously appeared on the website of New York Times columnist David Brooks, "The White House Sparring With its Conservative Opponents."White House Sparring with its Conservative Opponents - Part 3Part 3: In the wake of the Obamacare website debacle, the White House spars with its conservative opponents.The White House Sparring With Its Conservative Opponents - Part 4Part 4: The House Republican Conference has not budged from its plan for government-run insurance.

A  compounding pharmacy at the center of a fungal meningitis outbreak last year has agreed to a preliminary settlement that would create a $100 million fund for victims. The fund will also be used to pay off creditors of the bankrupt New England Compounding Center, attorneys in the case said. A judge will have to approve the plan before it goes into effect. The nationwide meningitis outbreak was linked to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based pharmacy. More than 700 illnesses and 64 deaths in 20 states were blamed on the injections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But the CDC noted the deaths are from "all causes among persons who meet the case definition and The pharmacy's owners said they deny any liability or wrongdoing, but want to play a major role in establishing a fund for those who died or suffered "as a result of this tragic outbreak," according to a statement announcing the settlement. Paul Moore, a trustee of the bankrupt pharmacy, supported the preliminary settlement agreement. "We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak," Moore said. The settlement amount would be funded by cash from the pharmacy's owners as well as other sources, such as insurance, tax refunds and the sale of a related business. Ripple effect In February, Massachusetts health officials ordered 11 compounding pharmacies to completely or partially shut down after unannounced inspections in the wake of the fungal meningitis outbreak. "Over the course of the unannounced inspections, partial or complete cease and desist orders were issued to 11 pharmacies for a range of violations," the health department said. Following the outbreak, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said it launched "a series of aggressive initiatives" aimed at preventing a recurrence. Those include new regulations requiring sterile compounding pharmacies to report volume and distribution to the state for the first time and the hiring of additional inspectors.	1
South Sudan's government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe, the nation's information minister said Monday. Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information and broadcasting. Earlier Monday, a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks. The United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol. Ethnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children. Fighters first struck Pibor on Saturday, attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers, said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army. Benjamin said there were no casualties and no direct confrontation between the two tribes there, because most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching. The nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group's South Sudan mission. Rajendran said the organization was afraid for its workers' safety and "very concerned" for the people of Pibor and Lukangol. "We believe tens of thousands are currently displaced without access to water, food and health care," he said. "The situation is tense. We don't know what is happening on the ground, so we are monitoring the situation." The nonprofit's clinic in Lukangol was "burned and looted," spokeswoman Emily Linendoll said, adding that its Pibor clinic "has been targeted." The attack on Pibor follows reports last week that Lou Nuer fighters raided Lukangol, burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward Pibor.	1

Cirque du Soleil and a Las Vegas casino are facing thousands of dollars in citations after a performer fell nearly 100 feet to her death during a show in June. The performer, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, plunged to the floor after the wire rope from which she was suspended broke, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said in a statement Tuesday outlining the results of its investigation into her death. Guillot-Guyard, an experienced acrobat and aerialist, died from "multiple blunt force trauma," OSHA said. The fall happened as Guillot-Guyard, 31, was performing in the final scene of the long-running Cirque du Soleil show "Ka" in front of an audience at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on June 29. During the scene, a mock battle, performers were suspended in the air on lines controlled by wireless remote controls. The wire rope Guillot-Guyard was attached to was severed by her "rapid ascent," which caused the rope to come out of the pulley and scrape against a "shear point," according to OSHA. She fell 94 feet to the floor, it said. Shortcomings cited The agency said Cirque du Soleil hadn't trained Guillot-Guyard properly and had failed to adequately protect employees working for the show. Those issues were among the six citations OSHA proposed for Cirque du Soleil, with fines totaling more than $25,000. It issued three citations for the MGM Grand, with total penalties of $7,000, saying the casino's employees were exposed to hazards because of shortcomings in Cirque du Soleil's safety measures. Both companies said they would appeal. "Cirque du Soleil completed an exhaustive review of its safety policies and procedures in the wake of the tragic accident involving Sarah," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement. "We have redoubled our efforts to ensure the overall diligence and safety of our performers and crew." MGM said that "safety always has been the top priority for both MGM Resorts and Cirque du Soleil and we continue to work to ensure the safety of our cast and crew." 'You could hear screaming' In the immediate aftermath of Guillot-Guyard's death, one man who witnessed her fall described the horrific sequence of events.	1
Japan's deputy prime minister stirred controversy this week by appearing to suggest that the government could learn from the way that Nazi Germany changed its constitution. The remarks by Taro Aso, who is also the Japanese finance minister, provoked criticism from Japan's neighbors and a Jewish organization in the United States. Aso, a former prime minister who has slipped up with verbal gaffes in the past, retracted the comments later in the week but refused to apologize for them or resign, saying they had been taken out of context. Amid persistent talk in Japan about revising the country's pacifist post-war constitution, Aso set off the controversy at a seminar Monday, in which he said that discussions over constitutional changes should be carried out calmly. "Germany's Weimar Constitution was changed into the Nazi Constitution before anyone knew," he said in comments widely reported by the Japanese media. "It was changed before anyone else noticed. Why don't we learn from that method?" Aso added: "I have no intention of denying democracy. Again, I repeat that we should not decide [constitutional revisions] in a frenzy." In 1933, Adolf Hitler's National Socialists turned the democratic Weimar Republic into a dictatorship using "a combination of legal procedure, persuasion, and terror," according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Hitler used a fire that burned down the parliament building as a pretext to suppress the opposition through an emergency clause in the constitution. He then pushed through the Enabling Act, which allowed him to govern without parliament and vastly extend the Nazis' grip on power. Words that hurt Aso's apparent reference to those changes drew expressions of concern from the governments of China and South Korea, two countries that suffered heavily under Japanese imperial aggression during World War II, a conflict in which Japan was allied with Nazi Germany. Beijing and Seoul are already wary of Japan's hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His campaign platform for elections last year included measures aimed at restoring Japanese national pride such as revising the constitution to give the country's self-defense forces the status of a regular army. Abe's party now has control of both houses of parliament. But it remains unclear if he will take on the difficult, controversial challenge of constitutional change, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers.	1
Hours after voting ended in Indonesia's presidential race, candidate Joko "Jokowi" Widodo proclaimed victory while his rival Prabowo Subianto urged patience as the official vote count proceeded. Results of an unofficial quick count on Wednesday indicated a slight edge for Widodo, a former furniture exporter who rose to become Jakarta governor, ahead of Prabowo, a former military man. "Today, Indonesia's new son has been chosen by the people," Widodo declared. "We begin a new phase in our history and we start a new beginning of Indonesia." Widodo's leap from relative obscurity to potential leader of the world's most populous Muslim nation has drawn comparisons to U.S. President Barack Obama's meteoric rise in 2008. For his supporters, the "Jokowi effect" heralds a new breed of political leaders -- a break from Indonesia's tradition of leaders with military, bureaucratic or elite backgrounds. "It's not a victory for the party, not a victory for the team but this is a victory for all Indonesian people," Widodo told his supporters, dressed in his trademark checkered shirt. Independent pollsters indicated about 52-53% of votes for Widodo and 46-48% for Prabowo. These unofficial quick counts, drawn from samples from polling stations, have usually been accurate to within a 1-2% margin of error. But unlike previous Indonesian elections, this presidential race is a tight one. "By most standards of democracies that we know, a vote spread of five to six percentage points would be seen as decisive. In the Indonesian context, this is pretty close," said Thomas Pepinsky, associate professor at Cornell University, who has an interest in South Asia. On Wednesday night, Prabowo suggested he wasn't fazed by the quick count results. "Let's allow KPU (Indonesia's election commission) to work and decide the victory," the candidate told his supporters. "Despite the results we received from a number of quick count(s)... the real count says that we are higher than our competitor." Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Indonesian president Suharto, has sought to project an image as a take-charge leader. Having never served in public office, the former lieutenant general has campaigned hard on his military service.	1
U.S. authorities have ratcheted up pressure on one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, releasing new details about the so-called Gulf Cartel's operations and offering up to a $50 million reward for the arrest of its leaders. These are weapons that the Mexican army said it seized from the ruthless Gulf Cartel in 2008. A federal indictment unsealed Monday charged Miguel Trevino Morales, a leader of the northern Mexico-based Gulf Cartel, of operating a criminal enterprise, cocaine distribution and firearms violations. Concurrently, prosecutors updated a separate indictment against three other top leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Antonio Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, for drug trafficking related crimes, all believed to be at large in Mexico. Fifteen other suspected cartel members are also named in that indictment. "We have learned that the most effective way to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations is to prosecute their leaders and seize their funding," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement. To that end, the departments of justice, state and treasury are working together to place pressure on the Gulf Cartel and what authorities describe as its ruthless enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas. The Department of the Treasury designated the four top bosses named in the indictments as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers, which authorizes the freezing of any assets they hold in the United States and other sanctions. The Gulf Cartel and Zetas, nicknamed collectively as "The Company," are among the major drug cartels that are behind the drug-related violence that has swept Mexico in recent years, according to authorities. Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made fighting the cartels a major priority. The group also operates in cities across the United States, authorities said. The court documents detail telephone conversations between the four leaders and more than a dozen other cartel members allegedly discussing the transportation and smuggling of cocaine and marijuana into the United States. "These indictments allege a stunning and sophisticated operation by 'The Company' to move illegal drugs into our communities and cash back to Mexico," Breuer said. The State Department is offering a rewards totaling up to $50 million for information leading to the capture of four top leaders and six other cartel lieutenants.	1
Stepping on the London subway train five years ago, the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games. Now, that's exactly where Britain's Martine  Joyce-Thompson is going.The twenty-one-year-old from West Sussex has a broken leg, but the London 2012 Paralympic Games are on her bucket list. A week before the Opening Ceremony, the lanky blond-haired girl is watching the London Marathon with her dad, a personal trainer, at the Olympic Stadium in east London. "I think I've always wanted to be a part of one of these Olympics or World Championships," she says to the camera. "I think it'll be amazing."A couple of hours before the race, she arrives at the stadium. "I've never run like that before," she says to the camera. "It felt like I hadn't run at all—it was like I was in a dream."She wins the race—her first marathon—and, as the camera makes its way around the track, we hear cheering crowds of spectators, people taking pictures of her, a woman in a wheelchair, and people cheering the British athletes. "It was just an amazing feeling," she tells the camera.That was October 2011, three months before the London 2012 Paralympic Games opened. Now three years later, she's the London 2012 Paralympic Games—or more precisely, the Games' ambassador in an upcoming documentary being made about the Games that will be screened at the end of February. The film's title, Paralympics for All, describes its goal: to spread the word about the Games' health-and-safety policies, the Paralympic movement, the Paralympics' health-and-safety programs, and the new technology developed by British athlete and filmmaker Steve McQueen.McQueen's innovative films include the Academy Award–winning 12 Years a Slave and the multiple-Oscar-winning Shame. Along with his producing partner, David Haye, both are veterans of the London 2012 Paralympic Games.McQueen had already created a film about the 2012 Paralympics, Paralympics 2012, before his 2010 injury, and he was just beginning the process—referred to by the filmmakers as "the making of"—to make a film about the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

Newly elected Boy Scouts of America President Robert Gates on Friday praised the leadership vote last year that welcomed gay youth into scouting. "In all candor, I would have supported going further, as I did in opening the way for gays to serve in the CIA and in the military," the former secretary of defense said in prepared remarks. Gates spoke at the Boy Scouts of America annual meeting in Nashville, TN. Gates, who was also director of the CIA was elected president of the BSA on Thursday. He also holds the rank of Eagle Scout. The Boy Scouts voted in 2013 to include gay youth, but does not allow openly gay adults in the organization. Gates warned that reopening the issue now could "irreparably fracture and perhaps even provoke a formal, permanent split in the movement -- with the high likelihood neither side would subsequently survive on its own."	1
Even though he was ill, Adam Scott could do little wrong in the early rounds at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He led by seven shots at the halfway mark at Bay Hill in Orlando and, despite his advantage being cut entering the final round, still held a comfortable three-shot advantage as play began Sunday. Unfortunately for the Aussie, he faltered and thus missed a chance to overtake the injured Tiger Woods as the world No. 1. Matt Every of the U.S. was the unlikely winner, compiling a strong round to claim his first PGA title. Scott shot a four-over 76, hitting five bogeys, to slip to third, two shots behind Every's total of 275. It wasn't the tournament he wanted ahead of the defense of his Masters crown next month. "I didn't putt well at all today," Scott told the Golf Channel. "If nothing else it's a good reminder on how much putting practice I need to do before going to the Masters and just how important it is. "If I think back to last year, I made every putt that you expect to in that last round and ultimately that's what gave me the chance to win." Every, who trailed Scott by four shots overnight, made up ground thanks to five birdies. But two bogeys on the last three holes gave Keegan Bradley an opportunity to force a playoff. Bradley, however, missed a birdie putt at the 18th that would have forced the playoff. Every's drought was over. "It's really cool," Every, who turned pro in 2006, told reporters. "I have had a lot of looks (at wins) and I kept telling myself maybe it's going to come somewhere special. I still can't believe I won. "It's hard, it's tough man. You just never know if it's going to happen."	1

When Suzanne Jablonski moved to New Jersey to start a new life, she felt mostly alone in her struggles raising a special-needs child. Her 18-year-old son, Brandon Timberwolf Munic, has emotional, learning and  physical disabilities, and Brandon was also diagnosed with a neurological disorder. As a result, he requires constant medical support and care, and his family has to travel around the country to receive it.A New Jersey judge ruled in favor of Suzanne and the state’s disability services office (DSA), which manages and finances Brandon’s disability services. But this win may be short-lived, since the state has proposed an amendment to the law that would prevent Suzanne from receiving most of the benefits and services required for Brandon’s care.The amendment to the law would make it more difficult for parents with disabled kids like Brandon to win legal standing. It will now be more difficult to move disability assistance to a specific family, and the DSA will need to demonstrate that the family did a reasonable job of providing this type of support to Brandon. The amendment would also affect how the DSA is paid for its work, making it even more difficult for parents to qualify for and successfully challenge the services provided to their children.In the meantime, Suzanne has been able to obtain disability funding through the Medicaid program, which is available to people with disabilities and children. Suzanne is now in the process of applying for a disability benefit for Brandon, and has raised the money to be eligible. But the proposed amendment may prevent her from being eligible.“The benefits I am getting now are not even close to what I have been able to get before,” says Suzanne. “There is no real substitute for a relationship with a disability attorney. They can guide you through the application process, they can help you make decisions, and they can give you an idea of the process your family should be adopting.”While Suzanne and Brandon’s story is unique, it illustrates the need for disability attorneys to be able to challenge eligibility determinations and win benefits for their clients. Suzanne may not have been able to win a fight to get Brandon the full amount of the benefits under the new regulations, but her experience is an example of what can happen when disability advocates have access to resources and are able to advocate for what is rightfully theirs.The new law is on track to take effect	0
Stacey Addison, who says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine, is headed home. Addison boarded a plane Tuesday on the first leg of her journey back to Oregon. "I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon," Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said. "This is terrific news for Stacey, for her family, and for all the Oregonians who have followed Stacey's story and helped support her from afar," Merkley said in a statement. Addison, 41, was detained in September in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. She was released in December but she still couldn't leave because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. Former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, hosted her temporarily at his home. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Kero told CNN in November that the case was a "nightmare."	1
Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and urns, and show solidarity with those they considered “heroes” in a case that has provoked the country’s most intense political feud in years.“We’ve come here together because we’ve all been through a lot — the loss of our friends, the pain we have felt for so long, and then the violence,” said David F. Brown, who lost his father in last month’s shooting. “But through all this, I have not been through anything like this before,” he added. “We’re still together and that’s how we’re going to keep our head up.”At the services, mourners spoke about how the victims had been remembered. One woman said it was “not fair” to see someone’s life end when they were still young.“Their life was never in vain,” said the unidentified woman. “We’re not able to give them up any more than we can give up their lives.”[Updated at 2:50 p.m. Friday: The gunman responsible for the shootings carried out today, Saturday Dec. 2 at a popular East Manchester, Connecticut, mall is dead. Authorities said he had killed three people and was found dead on a downtown street.David F.

He left the mall with a bag and opened fire, wounding two people at the mall at the opposite end.His weapon jammed before he entered a store. He then opened fire on the mall’s exit, wounding at least 10 people, before he was confronted by mall security guards.Four of the eight victims of the shooting were shot to death before police stormed the mall.

Maria Sharapova drove away a top of the range Porsche sports car for the third straight year in Stuttgart after battling back to beat Ana Ivanovic in the final Sunday. Sharapova may need to build a bigger garage Ã¢ÂÂ one that actually has a wall Ã¢ÂÂ to accommodate the $1.6 million car as an apartment in New York or Paris would already be too tiny.The top-ranked former world No. 1 is now 3-0 in three attempts, which includes a three-set victory over Ana Ivanovic at the Rogers Cup in Montreal this week.Sharapova has played the last 13 months in the shadow of Ivanovic, the last No. 1.After a shaky first set, Sharapova served for the tiebreaker at 5-all.

As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children. Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April with little fanfare. Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies. "We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups," said United spokesman Charles Hobart. The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early. "I have to wonder if it will end up slowing things down because of the extra time it takes for families to board," said Brett Snyder of the blog crankyflier.com. Kate Hanni of flyersrights.org calls the move "very anti-family." "There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane," said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN. "I hope United changes their mind." "If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them," Hobart said. "That message has been communicated." "We're not going to fly United knowing that we're going to have to put up with that extra hassle," wrote Steven Manson, a Brooklyn, New York, father of twin 4-year-old boys. "Frankly, we always look forward to the preboarding when we fly and try and position ourselves near the gate when boarding begins. It's just so helpful getting the car seat attached and everyone settled before the plane is crowded with passengers," Manson said in an e-mail to CNN. A guerrilla approach to flying with kids The policy change also has roots in the merger announced in 2010 between United and Continental. "We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft," Hobart said. As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding. However, the airline said it makes an announcement to all ticketed passengers before general boarding asking anyone who needs extra time or assistance to come forward.	1
When the Parr family started having serious health problems late in 2008, they had no idea it was associated with what they call "a multitude" of drilling operations that popped up near their 40-acre ranch in Decatur, 60 miles northwest of Dallas. At first, Lisa Parr dismissed her migraine headaches, nausea and dizziness as the flu, but when her symptoms persistently got worse, she knew something more serious was involved. "By 2009, I was having a multitude of problems," Lisa Parr told CNN. "My central nervous system was messed up. I couldn't hear, and my vision was messed up. My entire body would shake inside. I was vomiting white foam in the mornings." In 2009, Lisa's husband, Robert, and their 11-year-old daughter, Emma, also became ill, suffering a laundry-list of symptoms. "They had nosebleeds, vision problems, nausea, rashes, blood pressure issues. Being that the wells were not on our property, we had no idea that what they were doing on the property around us was affecting us," she said. 'Private nuisance' After a two-week trial that ended Tuesday -- Earth Day, coincidentally -- a Dallas jury awarded the Parr family $2.9 million for personal injury and property damages in the family's lawsuit against Plano-based Aruba Petroleum Inc. According to the lawsuit, Aruba Petroleum had 22 natural gas wells within a 2-mile radius of the Parrs' property, with three wells in close proximity to their Texas home. The closest was 791 feet away. As a result of poor management and lack of emission controls, Aruba Petroleum created a "private nuisance" to the Parr family by producing harmful air pollution and exposing them to harmful emissions of volatile organic compounds, toxic air pollutants and diesel exhaust, the lawsuit said. Op-ed: Make sure fracking is done right Aruba Petroleum argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the Parr family in any way. In a statement released after the verdict, Aruba said "natural gas development has long been prevalent in Wise County," and dozens of companies operate hundreds of wells there. The company further said it complied with state air-quality limits and that its experts made strong cases countering the Parrs' claims in court.	1
Key structural changes have been identified in the brain images of some patients with mild cognitive impairment which could help determine who's at greatest risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, studied MRI scans of 84 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 175 patients with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and 139 images of healthy brains. "Our initial goal was to locate similarities in the patients with Alzheimer's disease to those with MCI, in the hopes of finding a method to predict [MCI patients'] likelihood of developing the disease," said lead study author Linda McEvoy, assistant project scientist at UCSD's department of radiology. Neuroimaging results for the patients with Alzheimer's disease were as expected, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Radiology. Atrophy, which is loss of brain tissue, was visible throughout the brain. The temporal and parietal lobes, which affect cognitive function, saw the most damage. What surprised researchers were the differences in images from the MCI patients. More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients. The other half of the MCI patients showed only small amounts of tissue damage.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings » "Although the symptoms for the entire MCI group were primarily memory problems, other parts of the brain were impacted in over half the group," McEvoy said. "And even though these patients [with Alzheimer's-like atrophy] don't have problems with their cognitive function now, their MCI will likely develop to that in the future." Researchers also evaluated the brains of the MCI group one year after initial testing. They found that patients who earlier had mild cognitive impairment plus signs of atrophy were getting worse. Twenty-nine percent of the group had since been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the others had begun to show signs of more serious cognitive decline. The condition of patients in the MCI group whose scans showed minimal signs of atrophy the previous year remained about the same. "Only 8 percent of this group had developed Alzheimer's disease. The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased," McEvoy said.	1
Police mismanaged a shootout connected to the deaths of four Oakland, California, police officers last March, making a series of poor decisions that might have contributed to the record death toll, an independent board says. The board this week released a sometimes scathing report that paints a vivid picture of the chaos that descended on an east Oakland street on March 21 after a convicted felon opened fire on officers during a traffic stop. Lovelle Mixon, 26, is accused of fatally shooting two Oakland patrol officers and fleeing to a nearby apartment building. Mixon then allegedly shot and killed two SWAT officers who burst into the apartment before police fatally shot him. The incident was deadliest in Oakland police history, the board said. The panel, made up of law enforcement experts, said the two officers made a mistake in the traffic stop when both approached the car on the driver's side. That approach violated Oakland police training procedures and safety practices. But the report's most severe criticism focuses on how Oakland police handled the surge of 115 police cars that rushed to the scene after the traffic stop. "The activities of the 115 OPD [Oakland Police Department] and outside agency units on scene were disorganized and confused due to poor situational awareness and lack of clear command and control," the report says. Some other criticism: • None of the highest-ranking officers at the scene took an overall leadership role in the operation, and no command post was set up to efficiently dessiminate information. "As a consequence, no one knew who was in charge, adding to the confusion and disorganization," the report says. • Police leadership violated policy by assembling a SWAT team from officers on scene instead of waiting for the official special weapons and tactics team to arrive. • A decision was made to have the ad hoc SWAT team enter an apartment where the suspect was thought to be hiding. But the building was not "formally scouted; no effort was made to ascertain the status of apartment building residents, the apartment building's interior configurations, as well as individual apartment floor plans," the report says. • The SWAT team entered the apartment without a warrant before hostage negotiators or snipers arrived. The team had never trained together and was not ready for the high-powered response it received from the gunman. The gunman shot the first two officers who entered the apartment, killing one of them. As other officers entered the dimly lit front room filled with children's toys, the officers were startled to see a woman running at them, screaming.	1
With names like Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent under its belt, it's little wonder Paris has earned a reputation as one of the fashion capitals of the world. If "French chic" has become synonymous  with Paris fashion week, we might have reached the limits of the city's fashion talent.No fashion week is complete without a parade of fashion stars. One of our great traditions in Paris is watching them walk down the runway in full evening attire, head to toe, ready to take center stage. But it's not always an easy feat to catch a glimpse of some of the most fashionable people in the world.The first of our Paris season is nearly upon us and in comes a group of new faces making their way down the runway. One is Mika Pins, a 27-year-old designer who specializes in bridal wear and looks especially good in a sleeveless, low-cut black dress that shows off her toned, toned legs. Even more than the dress, though, it's the fact that Pins is all about the dress.Just a few days ago, Pins wore a simple black dress to a dinner party. It's a little unusual, as this black dress, which can be found for less than $100, can be quite revealing and is a little more revealing than what you'd pay for a black dress in New York or Milan.Pins has a long history of making her own clothes, often from vintage fabrics. Even though she is new to the Paris fashion scene, what she has done with it, we're quite confident Pins will take her brand to the next level. Her bridal dress is a perfect showcase for her talent, as it is simple, elegant and perfectly in line with her line and her personality.Another new face making her way down the runway is 20-year-old model Charlotte Rampling, who is looking like a fashion sensation. We don't know if she's been in every fashion magazine article or if she's been in every fashion show (it's hard to think of any), but her latest outfit was an eye-catching one.She wore a black mini dress, a long-sleeved cotton dress and a sleeveless dress. All were perfect for the evening and perfect for our first glimpse of Pins at Paris Fashion week. This is just the beginning, though, as these four newcomers are	0
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is two for two. The Republican from Janesville, Wisconsin, has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in as little as 48 hours. A feat near impossible in these times of extreme ills and suffering.The House Speaker, John Boehner, finally decided to put Ryan in the Speaker’s chair at the start of the week. Ryan’s performance in the House this week was one of the great successes of his career.A victory for the Republican Party, which was, after all, behind the Speaker.The Republicans’ majority in the House has remained steady since the election of 2012, but they have been unable to keep the majority in some key subgroups.These include a majority of women in the House; members of minority groups have held the House majority for only one year since the election of 1860. There is a strong case to be made that this is the result of the redistricting process.The GOP has gained seats from Democrats in districts drawn under the Voting Rights Act – the 1965 landmark legislation designed to prevent racial discrimination in elections – and lost seats from Democrats where there were substantial populations of nonvoters and immigrants.In a reversal of fortune, the conservative House Republicans have held on to the majority in the House, even while the Republican minority in the Senate has been reduced from 54 to 48. The result of the GOP’s election “shellacking” is the formation of what may be the most conservative chamber in history.That’s a huge achievement for them. The Democrats, in contrast, have lost seats in the House and have failed to gain control of any of the 50 state governments.But they have also lost governorships, control of state legislatures and control over Washington, DC. The result has been the loss of popular support for the Obama administration.In the Senate, there has been a gain in the Republican majority. The Democrats’ majority has grown from 51 to 52, though the number of Republican seats in the Senate has not grown.This is not about redistricting. It’s far more than that. It is about the political power of Republicans.The GOP’s political strength is in its geographic makeup. The number of Republican-leaning suburbs and rural areas that are not represented in Congress by Democrats in the 435-member House has been dramatically	0
Karry Trout's first patient was a 38-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. The patient had waited nearly six months after feeling a lump in her breast to visit the doctor. She had no health insurance. It  is easy, she said, to blame a healthcare system that doesn’t value a woman’s life. You don’t have to look far to find evidence of this point. A report from the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) states that 1 in 3 cancer patients in the US don’t have health insurance.Trout tells us about his patient, but before he starts talking, he uses a piece of equipment to draw a picture of the woman's body. This makes the drawing much prettier than the one he draws of the body of a dog. He tells us that she had just had a routine mammogram and breast ultrasound.It turns out that she had had no breast cancer in the last 5 years. Had she been examined properly, she would not have needed chemotherapy. But she had been diagnosed, and she had gone to three doctors for treatment, all of whom told her to go to this particular doctor, Trout, because he had an ultrasound that showed that she had cancer – at least that’s what she thought."There were so many times I said to myself that this woman had cancer,” Trout says. "But then when I looked at the ultrasound, I said, ‘I’m sorry, I don’t know what on earth is going on here.’"Trout believes that if she had been examined properly, she could have been given a treatment that will save her life.Trout was only 14 years old when his father became ill with cancer and, as a result, his mother moved from New York to Chicago. This, says Trout, was a major traumatic event for a family. He and his brother stayed behind and continued to live in close proximity to their father until he died; they were 15 and 13 at the time. They are now both older. "It's an important story to tell, because it teaches you that life is short and that our lives can change in an instant,” Trout says. “And the reality is that the human body is capable of changing even a cancerous mass in the breast.”Tr	0
Actor Sean Penn, a friend of Bolivian President Evo Morales, nonetheless angered the South American country's government after his call for the release of a U.S. businessman who has been imprisoned since 2011. Penn, known for his chumminess with Latin America's leftist leaders, is also an advocate for Brooklyn flooring contractor Jacob Ostreicher, whose supporters say has spent two years detained in Bolivia without evidence. At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee meeting Monday, Penn asked U.S. lawmakers to pressure the sponsors of the off-road Dakar Rally to cancel its planned 2014 route through Bolivia if Ostreicher is not freed. "The Dakar Rally, one of the world's most prominent displays of freedom and tenacity of the human spirit, will be parading through Bolivia even as thousands of prisoners like Mr. Ostreicher sit in feces-filled cells, forgotten behind locked walls," Penn said. On Tuesday, Bolivia's minister of culture shot back. "The remarks by Mr. Penn are his worst acting in all of his career," Pablo Groux said, according to the state-run ABI news agency. "The remark is offensive to the Bolivian people, totally out of context and lacking any understanding." The minister said the actor's comments harkened back to a time when the United States exerted heavy influence in Latin America. "Those days are long gone," Groux said. The rebuke from the Bolivian official is notable coming from a government that Penn has been friendly with. During his testimony before the subcommittee, Penn said that he does not blame Morales for Ostreicher's situation, but endemic corruption in the judiciary. Penn said that he met with Morales last year, with evidence supporting Ostreicher's innocence, and that "these findings were received by the president with tremendous personal and human grief." Ostreicher is under house arrest after spending 18 months in a notorious prison while his case crawled in the overburdened Bolivian judicial system. He was arrested in June 2011 on suspicion of money laundering tied to a rice-growing operation, and he languished in prison without formal charges. He maintained that corrupt officials had trumped up the case, and last year, six government officials were arrested for allegedly extorting and stealing from Ostreicher. But the case against him has not been dropped. READ MORE: American on hunger strike after 11 months in Bolivian prison	1
Former President Bill Clinton on Saturday defended his family foundation's practice of taking money from foreign countries, arguing that while he doesn't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed, he feels the foundation has "done a lot more good than harm." The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. Bill Clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects. "The UAE [United Arab Emirates] gave us money. Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they are helping us fight ISIS and they built a great university with NYU open to people around the world," Clinton said at a foundation event in Florida. "Do I agree with all the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia? No." Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton continued: "You've got to decide when you do this work, whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country. ... I believe we have done a lot more good than harm." The story became a controversy for the Clintons, one where even some Democrats questioned the practice. Hillary Clinton is the party's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month. Republicans jumped on board the story, too, using it to question the Clintons' ethics and whether, as president, she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation. Democrats that did publicly defend the Clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website. On Saturday, Clinton did the same. "My theory about all this is disclose everything. And then let people make their judgments," Clinton said. "I'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions." Clinton concluded his defense of the foundation, stating that he thinks organizations should "bring people together across great divides, around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better." The Clinton Foundation was founded by Bill Clinton after he left the presidency in 2001. To date, the foundation has raised over $2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects, including health and wellness, economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls.	1
Some may disagree whether George W. Bush was a "uniter, not a divider," as he liked to say, but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library. At Thursday's event in Dallas, Democratic former  secretary for state Condoleezza Rice and Republican former vice president Dick Cheney read a joint eulogy for Bush. This was a reminder that the relationship between Democrats and Republicans has deteriorated since the Bush era, but it did remind us that there was a time when bipartisanship could have worked.I was in high school on the day the Soviet Union's first satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched. It was a great moment. I was thrilled. The country was united and proud. The Soviet Union wasn't.The rest of my class was not so thrilled. At the end of the day, a girl called me by my first name, and told me I had no business being there. My parents, who had no idea what I looked like in that day's makeup, were less sure.I didn't like the school system at that time, and I wanted to go somewhere else. But I was too young to leave, and it was too late to change schools. I lived in the school system for more than a year, with constant humiliation. I had to hide my feelings so I didn't embarrass the other students. My parents kept pressuring me to go home and make friends, but I was afraid of making a big mistake, because it would make me look bad. Even I didn't find it easy to do.It didn't help that I got bullied at the end of the day by the only young African-American kids in my class. I remember thinking their constant nastiness, and my fear they would laugh at me, were like the weight of a great stone on my back during that day. The most they had ever gotten from me was that I wrote "papa" in English instead of "papa bear." I wanted to be a teacher like my father, and I was determined to do well. If I couldn't get the attention of a lot of other kids, I would get it from my dad. Unfortunately, he wasn't around when many of the other students were.My father wasn't all that good to me in the beginning, as it turned out. He was mostly angry at me when I did something he	0
A crash involving two trains in central Indonesia Saturday killed 36 people and injured 26, officials said. The crash occurred when a train traveling from Semarang in Central Java to the capital of Jakarta was struck from behind by another train headed to Jakarta from Surabaya in East Java, according to Bambang Ervan, transport ministry spokesman. Four coaches have been lifted off the track, and one remains, said Sugeng Priyono, spokesman for the Indonesian railway company. Many people were crushed in the last carriage of the first train, which was stationary when the other train slammed into it, survivors said. "Suddenly I heard a very loud sound from behind," said Anwar Riksono, a passenger who was sleeping when the trains crashed. "It shook so hard and the lights went off." A crane lifted away large pieces of the train, mangled beyond recognition. The transportation ministry says it is investigating whether the crash was caused by human or technical error.	1
Americans are forgoing medical attention in the face of high health-care costs, a new consumer health survey has found. The high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment, a survey finds. Specifically, 24  percent of those surveyed are turning to a private “alternative medicine” center, such as a chiropractor or naturopath. Some of the people in the survey said they are finding the treatment to be ineffective.According to the survey, the top reason people are turning to nonmedical sources for health care is to save money, with 22  percent of those in the survey using alternative medicine first.Other reasons include trying a treatment that didn't work and being dissatisfied with their doctor's attention to a health issue: 27 percent said they were dissatisfied with their doctor's expertise and 29 percent said their health-care provider didn't do a good job treating a health issue.A majority of those surveyed said they don't have health insurance, which is likely due to the high cost of medical care.The results are based on the results of a 2016 University of Michigan/Ann Arbor Survey on Consumer Well-Being and Healthcare Satisfaction. The survey was conducted by the Ann Arbor Area Survey Center, which is contracted by the U-M Institute of Behavioral Research. The project is funded by three sources. The first is U-M’s Center for Health Services Studies. The second is the Ann Arbor Area Foundation, a charity with a broad mission statement, including research, policy and advocacy. The third is The U-M Interdisciplinary Health Initiative. The IHI consists of more than 90 faculty members in the School of Social Work, School of Public Health and School of Education, and also includes faculty from the School of Information and Library Science, and School of Medicine.The report found that the health conditions most likely to cause people to seek care outside of traditional health care are arthritis, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Other conditions were also frequently given as reasons for seeking care outside of conventional medicine, such as cancer and depression. The survey found that people who have not had health insurance are more likely to seek care outside of conventional medicine, for reasons including cost and insurance issues and to reduce their risk for heart disease and complications of diabetes.“Our survey indicates that people are increasingly turning to complementary and alternative medicine treatment for their health care,” said Dr. Scott	0
When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, "Antichrist" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter. Danish auteur Lars von Trier has been making films that shock, provoke and impress for over 40 years. Filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at Cannes and the two-hander starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception. But it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many. Von Trier was labeled a woman-hater for the wince-inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead Charlotte Gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a DIY clitoridectomy right to camera. An Ecumenical Jury that normally hands out a prize at Cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award "Antichrist" an "anti-prize" for being "the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world." "Lars von Trier, we get it," wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times. "You really, really don't like women." Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: "I mostly see myself as the female character," the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes. Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater? Tell us below in the SoundOff box The director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness. Indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von Trier, who is famously multi-phobic, would be able to make another film. In the winter of 2006, he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital, the aftermath of which left him "like a blank sheet of paper," he told Danish paper Politiken at the time. Today, if not fully recovered -- the most terrifying thing he can think of is still "myself" -- he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues.	1
Two weeks after a police-involved shooting sparked violent protests in a St. Louis suburb, the mood turned more tranquil Saturday with smaller crowds and lots of music. Gone were police in riot gear glaring at defiant protesters. The tear gas, rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails were nowhere to be seen, either. In their place were clusters of officers, hanging around businesses, chatting with one another. Shops reopened by late Friday and residents gathered for ribs at a local barbecue restaurant boarded up with plywood, a visible reminder of the violent protests and looting just a few days ago. A van rolled down the streets with men grilling hot dogs in the back and handing them out to passersby. Amid the vibrant noise of a heartbroken city slowly coming back to life, a preacher hollered, "Praise Jesus!" as a choir on a flatbed belted out hymns, leaving pauses for his exaltation. The change in mood comes two weeks to the day after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. Protesters have taken to the streets daily in the mostly black city, sometimes clashing violently with officers. Hundreds of people walked the streets later Saturday in a march in Brown's memory, organized by the NAACP. Despite the calm, slivers of earlier tension hovered. A vendor sold T-shirts adorned with the words, "It's time to start the healing" as a small group marched down the streets chanting, " Hands up! Don't shoot!" and "No justice, no peace." 2-year-old protester Before calling it a night on Friday, Tonja Bulley, 49, of nearby Jennings, made one last march along the protest route with her grandson, Tyler Randall Foster, 2. The toddler carried a sign that read, "You don't have to shoot. I'm unarmed." Bulley has been to the protests daily since Brown was killed. This was the second time she'd brought Tyler. "He might not understand why I'm out here, but I'm out here for him," she said. "One day he'll read about this movement, and he'll know he made this change right along with his granny. I want to make things better for my grandson. I want things to change. ... I really don't want my grandson to be another Mike Brown."	1
The Space Shuttle Discovery launched late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the start of its 39th and final flight. "This was a pretty successful day," said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations. "It was just an amazing event." The six-member crew will deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the international space station during its 11-day mission. Originally scheduled for November, Discovery's launch had been delayed in order to make repairs to the external tank's support beams. And NASA halted its countdown on Thursday, at five minutes, because of a computer problem related to safety on the "eastern range." But after a confirmation that all was good to go, the countdown resumed, and the shuttle lifted off about three minutes behind its planned 4:50 p.m. ET launch. Five minutes in, NASA's official blog reported "a good separation for solid rocket boosters," which separated from the main shuttle after pushing the shuttle through Earth's lower atmosphere. Shortly thereafter, the blog reported that the Discovery and its astronauts were "safely in orbit," having "performed flawlessly" on its launch. Gerstenmaier noted, and video showed, four pieces of foam tearing apart from the shuttle about four minutes into launch. But the NASA administrator called these incidents "typical" and likely harmless, since they came off "after the area of concern" when the atmosphere was so thin to make its impact negligible. The crew is headed by Steve Lindsey, and includes a late addition in Steve Bowen -- who became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of Tim Kopra, when Kopra was injured last month in a bicycle accident, according to NASA. Prior to Thursday's launch, Discovery had spent 352 days in orbit, circling the Earth 5,628 times. It has also carried 246 crew members, more than any space vehicle in history. "In a way, it's ... sad to see the last flight," said astronaut Steven Swanson. "It's such a wonderful vehicle." The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19 and will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona. Atlantis is tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer.	1
Blake Mycoskie is the founder and "chief shoe giver" of TOMS Shoes, a company that matches every pair of shoes it sells with a free pair to an impoverished child. Blake Mycoskie started TOMS Shoes in 2006. The company is committed to giving free shoes to poor children around the world. CNN caught up with the 32-year-old entrepreneur to talk about the inspiration behind his revolutionary business and what he has planned next. CNN: Tell us about the TOMS model. Mycoskie: The TOMS initiative is very simple: For every pair of shoes we sell, we give a pair away. When we know that say, we're going to sell 10,000 pairs this spring, we make another 10,000 to be given away. CNN: Where did you get the idea to start TOMS? Mycoskie: I decided to go back to some of the places that my sister and I had visited on "The Amazing Race." [Mycoskie and his sister participated in the reality TV show in 2002.] I found myself going on to Argentina. I went to some of the villages and it was one of the defining moments of my life when I saw these kids not wearing shoes. That's where I kind of had this 'ah ha' moment. I started thinking, what if I started a business where every time I sold a pair of shoes, I would guarantee that customer that I would give another pair to someone who does not have shoes? CNN: How did you pursue your vision? Did you have any experience as a designer or shoemaker? Mycoskie: I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition. There were a lot of really cool styles of shoes in Argentina that we did not have in the United States so I picked one of them, the alpargata, and I started figuring out how to make shoes. CNN: Did you expect the company to be a big success when you launched? Mycoskie: I was not really looking to make any money on the deal. I wanted to be able to sell the shoes for enough money to give away another pair and to hire one or two people to administer it and keep it going once I went back to work.	1
Ain Shams University Biologist Hebat Abdel Hadi is taking "waste not, want not" to a whole other level. Alphonso Van Marsh discovered first hand how damaging the Nile crayfish can be. She says crayfish carcasses the part of the crustacean that humans often throw away are for the birds. As higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson's Food to report losses this year, Abdel Hadi says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens. Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed. Her studies included comparing chickens fed with fish meal, with those raised on meal made with crayfish waste. "The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat. The color of the meat is better, the taste is better, it looks better," she says. The crayfish carcass is largely shell and skeleton. Feed nutritionists say crayfish-sourced feed would therefore contain high percentages of calcium and minerals. As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs. But poultry nutrition experts warn that chicken farming is a complex science that involves multiple nutrition and energy needs. "The challenge has to do more with genetics, and the right balance for this fast growing bird," says Martin Humphries, Feed Sales Director for an English specialist poultry feed supplier. "Crayfish heads will have some meat in there for protein. Crayfish skeletons will have calcium and I'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [feeding crayfish to chickens] is a leap too far for now," Humphries says. Egypt is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the Nile River. Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt. The crayfish that have a penchant for clawing into fishermen's nets and eating their catch are causing problems for fishermen. But are there enough crayfish to sustain a chicken feed industry? Andrew Kendall, a spokesman with the UK's largest feed manufacturer BOCM Pauls is unsure.	1
When she was a public health administrator for the state of California, Kathryn Hall-Trujillo found that her greatest challenge was paying for babies who were born sick. "The figure we were working with at that time was about $300,000 ... to stabilize a baby for the first 90 days," said Hall-Trujillo, who worked for the state from 1976-1991. At the same time, she said, it cost just $2,000 to ensure pregnant mothers received all the care they needed for a healthy pregnancy and proper delivery. The staggering disparity, along with troubling rates of infant mortality in America, compelled Hall-Trujillo, 62, to find a solution. "It occurred to me that one of the things that we could do that would cost hardly anything was to make sure that moms who were at risk ... [were] really connected to care," she said. What Hall-Trujillo came up with was Birthing Project USA. Since 1988, the nonprofit organization has been battling high infant-mortality rates by pairing soon-to-be moms with volunteer "sister friends" who provide guidance and support through the pregnancy and first year of the baby's life. Of every 1,000 babies born in the United States, at least six (6.14) do not survive their first year of life, according to the CIA World Factbook. That gives the United States only the 45th best infant mortality rate in the world, trailing top-ranked Monaco (1.78 deaths per thousand births) and countries such as Japan (2.79) and the United Kingdom (4.78). And African-American babies, regardless of the mother's age, income or educational level, are more than twice as likely to die before the age of 1 than Caucasian babies, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is this at-risk group that the Birthing Project primarily targets. "By the act of going back and saving what we consider to be our little sisters at risk, we have found out that we're also saving our own lives, because we need this kind of information and ... support, regardless of where we are on the socioeconomic ladder," Hall-Trujillo said.	1
President-elect Barack Obama called his former Republican presidential rival, Sen. John McCain, a hero at a bipartisan dinner Monday night and encouraged politicians to reach across the aisle. President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner. "I could stand here and recite the long list of John's bipartisan accomplishments ..." Obama said. "Campaign finance reform. Immigration. The Patients' Bill of Rights. All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country. And yet, what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves, but the true motivation behind them." McCain returned the gracious feelings at the dinner. "I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago," McCain said. "Tomorrow, the President-elect will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness," McCain went on to say. "He has my sincere best wishes for his success, and my promise of assistance. For his success will be our success." After praising McCain, Obama urged everyone to take the bipartisan dinner past "just an inaugural tradition" and turn it into a "new way of doing the people's business in this city." "We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates," Obama said. "But let us strive always to find that common ground, and to defend together those common ideals, for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now." On the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect even made time for a joke. "I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain," Obama said as he opened his speech. "And then, according to the rules agreed to by both parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a rebuttal." Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others.	1
Chelsea Handler has made a clean break from E!. Or at least we assume it was clean, since Handler's final "Chelsea Lately" episode Tuesday included one of her infamous celebrity-accompanied shower scenes. Over the past seven years of "Chelsea Lately" on the E! network, host Handler has roped two other stars -- friend Sandra Bullock and fellow late night host Conan O'Brien -- into having nude shower fights with her. The running gag was brought to a close on Tuesday as an indignant Ellen DeGeneres climbed into Handler's roomy shower set, fully clothed but wearing a shower cap, demanding answers as to why Handler never had her on the show. "Is it because I'm a lesbian?" DeGeneres asked Handler, who, per usual, was stark naked. "No!" Handler responded. "I didn't even know you were a lesbian. I thought you were married to Ryan Seacrest." You didn't think Handler would say goodbye to E! without landing another joke against the network's patron saint of celebrity news, did you? What we'll miss about 'Chelsea Lately' Throughout "Chelsea Lately's" eight-season run, Handler has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show, which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash-talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional. Those irritated by the Justin Biebers and Kardashians of the world likely found a kindred spirit in Handler, who wasn't ashamed to have open contempt for some of her show's topics. (One of the rumored reasons for Handler's exit was that she just didn't want to talk about Bieber anymore.) It's no surprise that neither the pop star nor E!'s first family participated in Handler's farewell show Tuesday, but there wasn't a shortage of celebrity guests. Handler is known to run with a powerful crew that includes A-list actress Jennifer Aniston. On Tuesday, the former "Friends" star joined Sandra Bullock and Mary McCormack for a mock intervention (sit through it until the end; the surprise guest is worth it), and Miley Cyrus also showed up to perform a cover of Roy Orbison's "It's Over."	1
The 15-year-old Mexican youth who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN Thursday. The victim, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, had been apprehended by U.S. officials on more than one occassion but was never criminally charged, Qualia said. The use of juveniles to smuggle people across the border is a common tactic for smugglers, he said. Meanwhile, a video obtained by CNN casts doubt on the Border Patrol agent's claim that he was surrounded by rock-throwing suspected illegal immigrants when he fatally shot the boy on the border at Ciudad Juarez. CNN obtained the video, which was shot by a witness on a cell phone camera from the Mexican side of the border, from affiliate Univision. The video aired on its program Primer Impacto late Wednesday evening. The video shows part of the buildup before the incident, with several individuals running underneath the Puente Negro, a railroad span that connects the two countries. Monday night's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when Border Patrol agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the United States near the Paso del Norte port of entry, FBI Special Agent Andrea Simmons said. In the distance, a U.S. Border Patrol officer on a bicycle can be seen making his way toward the area. Seconds later, the officer can be seen getting off the bicycle and approaching two of the four suspected Mexican nationals who had just crossed through an opening in the fence. One of the suspects is detained by the officer, but never handcuffed, and is dragged a short distance. This happened on the U.S. side of the border. Moments later, the officer points what appears to be his firearm in the direction of a second suspect, standing about 60 feet away from the officer -- on the Mexican side of the border. The video shows the suspect running away. Seconds later, two gunshots can be heard on the video. A third gunshot is heard in a different sequence of the tape. After the shooting, another suspect is seen running in the upper left side of screen away from the incident. "They're throwing rocks," witnesses screaming in Spanish can be heard in the background of the video as the officer opens fire.  "They hit him ... they hit him."	1
So very many places to go, yet so little time to pore over the options. It's summer vacation planning season and travel recommendation site Gogobot's users have whittled down the long list of possibilities by homing in on their favorites. On Tuesday, Gogobot released its top picks in two categories -- best natural wonders and best guided tours -- based on survey responses and nominations from its community of 2.5 million registered users, as well as reviews posted in the last 12 months for each destination or tour. The best-of lists are part of Gogobot's annual Travelers' Favorite Awards. "We really want to pique people's curiosity and help them discover places they might not have thought about or might not have heard of that they'd find really fun," said Travis Katz, Gogobot CEO and co-founder. In the guided tours category, those ideas include the Seattle Underground Tour, which takes visitors through parts of Seattle buildings that were largely built over after the Great Fire of 1889. The top pick in the natural wonders category is far more visible, especially from the beaches of Waikiki: Diamond Head State Monument in Honolulu tops the list, followed by the Grand Canyon, Northern California's Muir Woods and other awe-inspiring natural sites in the United States and beyond. Check out the gallery above for the top 10 wonders and see the top guided tour recommendations here.	1
Seventy years ago this week, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the GI Bill of Rights, formally the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, which the House of Representatives and Senate passed unanimously. It authorized  those of the armed forces who had served "on active duty in the current war or in a previous war or in campaigns, training, testing or other activities of a similar nature" to attend college at no more than 90 percent of the cost of public universities. The GI Bill was a godsend for veterans of World War II, who served their country by making the Army their lifelong profession and the Air Force their chosen career.The new law was the product of a joint committee that included then Representative Robert F. Wagner of New York and then Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, as well as James V. Forrestal, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and George Marshall, the Secretary of State. Forrestal later remembered meeting with Roosevelt in the Oval Office to discuss the bill. Roosevelt was delighted to give the bill the "gold touch." He said to Forrestal, "The only way we'll get the bill passed, is to make every one of the major congressmen sign it."In his first term, Roosevelt's chief legislative achievement was the Social Security Act of 1935, which guaranteed retirement benefits to American workers, and to state workers in all 50 states, as well as to all children born in the country. The Supreme Court's decision in the 1935 case of United States v. Butler, declaring that the federal government had no general power to tax income, was one of the most important decisions that gave stability to the administration of Social Security.In 1936, Roosevelt signed the National Recovery Act, which established a government jobs program as a way to give money to industry for the job creation that would in turn provide new workers for the federal government. New legislation in 1938 established the Office of Price Administration, which brought price stability to the country's  markets. In 1940, Roosevelt signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which gave agricultural producers and workers a tax credit for the additional value of the crops produced, and in 1941, he signed the National Labor Relations Act, establishing a system of federal regulation of working conditions and collective bargaining, and creating the National Labor Relations Board. Then, the next year the Social Security Act was enacted, and by 1942 nearly all American citizens were receiving retirement benefits.Roosevelt's greatest achievement in the second	0
March 3, 2010 Download PDF maps related to today's show: • Chile • Iraq and Kuwait • China Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The earthquake in Chile was so powerful, it might have affected time! I'm Carl Azuz. You're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Chile Earthquake AZUZ: Aftershocks, still rumbling across parts of Chile. At least a dozen were recorded from Monday to Tuesday. This quake left thousands of residents without food, without water, without electricity and other just basic services. Yesterday morning, the country's president said that all emergency measures should be in place by the end of the day. Of course, the international community is pitching in, too. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Chile Tuesday, bringing along some supplies and promising that more help is on the way. Secretary Clinton also praised Chile for how prepared it was to respond to this kind of disaster and for how well the nation has responded so far. So, what's with that point we mentioned at the beginning of the show about the earthquake affecting time? Well, according to one scientist, the quake was so powerful it's possible that it affected the Earth's rotation. Based on this scientist's calculations, it should have shortened the length of a day by one-and-a-quarter microseconds. Of course, this is the second major quake to strike recently. Haiti suffered a 7.0-magnitude quake in January. And while that tremor wasn't as powerful as the one in Chile, the devastation that it caused seems to have been significantly worse. Joe Johns examines some of the reasons why. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The quake in Haiti was a 7.0, killing more than 200,000 people. The quake in Chile registered 8.8, as much as 800 times stronger. The death toll less than a thousand so far. Why is that? Geography, for one thing. The Port-au-Prince quake was in shallow earth, 15 miles from the city. The Chile quake was 30 miles off the coast, deep under water.	1
A Cuban prisoner who went on hunger strike to protest his arrest for taking part in a demonstration died Thursday, according to other dissidents in the country. Wilmar Villar Mendoza, 31, died in a hospital in Santiago after his kidneys and other organs failed, said Yoani Sanchez , a prominent Cuban blogger and advocate of press freedom in the country. Sanchez said she had spoken with Villar Mendoza's widow, Maritza, by telephone. His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months. A Cuban court sentenced Villar Mendoza to four years in prison in November, Sanchez said, a sentence he said he felt was unjust. Villar Mendoza started his hunger strike following his sentencing, halting it briefly in December when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered, Sanchez said. Villar Mendoza's death was confirmed by the wife of another dissident and by the head of an opposition research organization inside Cuba, who could not be identified for security reasons. It happened just weeks after the death of another hunger striker, Rene Cobas, who began his protest because he was not part of the government's recent mass pardon. Cobas died of a heart attack on January 1 after authorities at the Boniato Prison, near Santiago, disregarded a doctor's recommendation that he be moved to a provincial hospital, according to Elizardo Sanchez, who heads the island's independent Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Cobas had gone on strike immediately after the president announced the latest round of amnesty on December 23. Cobas called the pardons "exclusive and limited," Sanchez said. The decision to release 2,900 prisoners followed "numerous requests" from their family members and religious institutions, and was a humanitarian gesture, Castro said last month. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the "generosity and strength of the revolution." The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Among those were to be freed were prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who were sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking would not be released.	1
I have a confession. As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by. I don't understand it. I'm not even sure I want to. "Bring your daughter to the slaughter," bellows Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Why would I want to do that? Why would I want to listen to anyone even suggesting I do that? Outside The Crobar in London's Soho our intrepid reporter tries out her rock moves. While the thought of spending the evening head banging leaves me longing for an expensive glass of merlot, slightly fruity, and perhaps a long sit down, I can't escape the feeling that I'm somehow missing out. As a child of the 70s, how could I have missed the birth of a wildly popular new music genre right in the next decade? Even at the end of the 80s, when Iron Maiden was releasing its "First Ten Years" compilation of greatest hits, I would have been sixteen (or thereabouts), the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long-haired, rebellious rocker in tight leather pants. You'd think. There's only one thing for it -- a crash course in all things metal with the man who knows, self-confessed metalhead Malcolm Dome, who also presents the chart show for 24-hour UK rock and metal radio station TotalRock. I meet him at the TotalRock studios in Central London. The stairs are scuffed. It smells of stale sweat. I'm pleased to see Malcolm is wearing the traditional heavy metal attire of black T-shirt and black jeans. Obviously I'm going to have to go and buy a T-shirt, perhaps one with a skull on it. "You can wear anything you want," Malcolm assures me. "You'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high-powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal. They can't go around dressed as I'm necessarily dressed now all the time because it doesn't fit into their jobs." Fortunately for Malcolm, his job as heavy metal journalist and broadcaster almost requires him to look the part. He's been involved in the scene since the late 1960s, when he fell for a young heavy metal group called Black Sabbath.	1
Maria Sharapova's wait for another WTA Tour title must continue after the four-time grand slam champion suffered a shock defeat in the semifinals of the Paris Open on Saturday. Top seed Sharapova would have moved back to fourth in the world rankings by winning her 30th career crown this weekend, but was beaten 4-6 6-3 6-4 by fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. "I started the match really well, but as the match continued I wasn't doing the things that really helped me in the first set," said 2012 French Open champion Sharapova, who returned to the tour in January after missing the final third of last season with a shoulder injury. "I wasn't being aggressive, I wasn't in the court -- she was playing with a lot of confidence in the match and I gave her that opportunity to play her game." Since requiring shoulder surgery back in 2008, Sharapova has struggled for consistency with her serve, and that was apparent in Melbourne when she lost in the last 16 to eventual runner-up Dominika Cibulkova, and again in the French capital. The 26-year-old, whose last tournament win came last April in Stuttgart, ended the match with two double-faults. "They obviously came at the wrong time," said Sharapova, who heads to her former home of Sochi on Sunday to start her role as a TV commentator at Russia's first Winter Olympics. "When I was down in games in the first couple of sets I felt my serve really helped me, but in the third set I didn't keep that level up. I definitely need to improve that percentage going forward." Pavlyuchenkova, ranked 26th, will next take on either Sara Errani at the indoor event as she seeks the sixth WTA title of her career -- but first in a Premier-level event. "I had to serve well -- I had no choice today, because Maria has one of the best returns on the tour," she said. "We played a few years ago and she broke me a lot of times." Errani, beaten by Sharapova in the 2012 final at Roland Garros, battled to a 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 7-6 (7-5) win over Alize Cornet in just over three hours after the Frenchwoman battled back from 5-3 down in the decider.	1
A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court this week. Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said. The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted. The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter. "My first feeling is extreme sadness," said Hallie Adams, the former wife. "I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing." Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset. "I'm embarrassed to live in Texas," said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video. Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games. The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet "to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time," Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father. "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," she said last November. "It wasn't any huge happening or anything." She said she told her father she had the video, "and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it." The video posting said, "Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter." The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries. At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, "What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal." At another point, he yells at her, "You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?" William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him.	1
Iraq's state-owned oil exploration company has made the country's first oil find in 30 years, an Oil Ministry spokesman said Monday. The company found at least a billion barrels of crude under the ground in a southeastern province near the border with Iran, spokesman Assim Jihad said Monday. The discovery in Maysan, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Baghdad, is a "significant achievement" for the country, Jihad said. Despite vast reserves and reliance on oil for government income, exploration in Iraq has been hindered by decades of conflict. With the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, Iraq's government depends on oil revenues to fund more than 90% of its budget. The discovery comes seven months after exploratory drilling began, Jihad said. Iraq produces 3.2 million barrels of oil a day, exporting 72% of it, he said. In 2010, Iraqi officials estimated the country had 143 billion barrels of extractable oil, most of it in the southern oil fields.	1
I love you Rihanna. You succinctly gave voice to the anger that's been building ever since Washington Post columnist George Will wrote skeptically about young women caught up in a "supposed ills" of the digital world.You don't know how to respond to your critics, but in this instance, you needn't.I don't feel the same rage when I see the way President Obama and his friends in the media are trying to silence anyone who disagrees with them. But I do feel the anger when my young daughters, and friends I know, are subjected to endless hours of online indoctrination on college campuses. Whether it's a YouTube video, a college newspaper, a social networking site or some other medium, it's a form of brainwashing that's designed, quite frankly, not for the benefit of the young, but for the benefit of advertisers.That's one reason why I'm disappointed and frustrated that the college newspaper at the University of California at Los Angeles has decided to take issue with an article in the Daily Bruin about the impact of social media on college campuses. The Daily Bruin's editor, Bob Witte, a professor of communication and public affairs, writes about what he calls the "increasingly dominant trend of student-driven journalism."I agree with Witte and other students that what they're doing is not only unnecessary but dangerous. We need a return to our roots and an expansion of critical thinking skills. But until we have a robust, balanced media that serves both the public and the students, there will never be a significant shift in thinking about what it means to be a student.I have a personal stake in this. About a year ago I went to UC Los Angeles with my two daughters, ages 12 and 11, with the goal of spending time with them. I thought it was time for them to start a blog, see what they were made of, and get a good sense of what life is like on a college campus. That's why I've written this column. It's for the benefit of them and for anybody else, as well.When I decided to take them to UC, my kids were 14 and 13. Now, they are 15 and 11. How different their lives would be had I not taken them to UC?I was excited to take them and tell them what a great school it is, but I also wanted them to understand what could happen	0
Can you really go home again? "Dumb and Dumber To" is just the latest to trade on our love of nostalgia by revisiting a past hit. "Dumb & Dumber" debuted in 1994 and the combination of the Farrelly brothers as directors and stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels was cinema gold. The film went on to become a cult classic. But is it possible to recapture that type of magic 20 years later? After all, these days Daniels is more well known for his dramatic role on HBO's "The Newsroom" and neither he nor Carrey are as young as they used to be. So far critics haven't found a lot of evidence that the pair can go home again in terms of replicating what made the first film beloved (and yes we remember the 1995 animated TV show "Dumb and Dumber: The Series" and the 2003 movie prequel "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"). "The charm of the original, to the extent that the original was an enjoyable character farce that led to better things for all participants, is long gone," writes Scott Mendelson for Forbes. "This is not the 'Dumb and Dumber' sequel we needed, but it's the one we deserved for inexplicably clamoring for a second installment in the first place." Andrew Barker of Variety writes "Sporadically very funny, mostly very tedious, and sometimes truly vile, this 18-years-too-late sequel nonetheless exhibits a certain puerile purity of purpose, and should accrue healthy profits playing to the nostalgia of the dumb and the dumb at heart." But good or bad, Hollywood will always return to the well be it with television or movies in the hopes that they can rally those who have held on to their fond memories for years. Here are a few examples. 1. "Veronica Mars" Fans loved this former TV show so much that they helped fund a movie just to catch up with the characters. The series about a teenaged private detective ended in 2007 but the "Veronica Mars" motion picture landed in theaters in 2014 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It didn't break any records at the box office, but the faithful didn't seem to care. 2. "Arrested Development" Look up "cult classic" and "Arrested Development" will be right there.	1
Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media. On Tuesday, the NYPD's Twitter account, @NYPDNews, asked New Yorkers to  "Please send this message to every New Yorker: Do not attempt to rob this man." @NYPDNews later tried to explain the tweet by saying that "There was no threat made and no crime was committed." Here's what you need to know.1. It Wasn't A Warning At AllAfter Twitter users pointed out the tweet's grammatical mistakes, the account's director, Jonathan Technologies, apologized: "This was a mistake. This was not a warning, and we will work to ensure that nothing like this occurs again." But police aren't satisfied and said that police officers "shouldn't be giving out personal warnings on Twitter." And while they say that the tweet actually wasn't part of a larger warning against gun violence, it does reveal a problem with New York's department's entire social media strategy: "NYPD has been tweeting threats against individuals, and it's not acceptable."2. Twitter Is A Place That Gets A Lot Of ThreatsMore than 1,000 tweets about the NYPD from 2012 and 2013 have been deleted. This tweet from March 2012, called for a police officer to "blow your head off." This one from late 2011, a "NYPD officer," also urges "surgical strikes" and urges New Yorkers to "take matters into your own hands."3. The NYPD's Office Of Social Media Is In Denial And Trying To Cover UpThe NYPD has been accused of using "false flag" attacks to discredit critics and embarrass its critics.In 2012, a "false flag" attack occurred where a fake blog was created about a journalist for The New York Times.In 2013, the "fake" police officer tweet was one of a series of tweets claiming that the New York Daily News was a "scam."And that last incident was just one example of the kind of content that the NYPD is now attempting to defend. In December, the NYPD Twitter account posted that a police officer had been suspended for writing the following:"I am the greatest, most powerful, most courageous man with the power to make the lives of those around me a living hell.I am	0
Since Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, first conquered Mount Everest in 1953, thousands of trekkers have tried to follow their footsteps. According to the Nepalese Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, more than 3,500 have successfully climbed the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, the world's highest. More than a tenth of that number scaled the summit last year alone. But with the mountaineers' lofty dreams come a price: a trail of trash that now threatens the peak's environment. A group of 15 artists in Nepal are turning that trash into art. Under a project called "Mt. Everest 8848 Art Project I" created last year, they have collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down by climbers from the mountain, including remains of a helicopter that had crashed into the slopes during the 1970s. "With this collaboration we aimed to raise awareness about pollution at Everest," explained Kripa Rana Shahi, director of Da Mind Tree, the organization that initiated the project. Working tediously for a month, the artists transformed oxygen cylinders, cans, glass bottles and discarded trekking tools into 74 pieces of art and held their first of many exhibitions for interested buyers in November 2012. Geographer reaches Mount Everest summit amidst tragedy "Many of the artworks reflect mountain life and mountaineering experiences," says artist Sushma Shakya. "It was interesting what we came up with, and how this trash could turn into something beautiful." "The visitors are amazed by the artwork, and we've received encouraging feedback. We hope our creations will help inspire actions against pollution at the Everest," Nara Bahadur BK, another artist, said. The exhibitions have attracted more than 3,800 visitors, with the pieces priced from $17 to $2,400. Nineteen pieces have been sold so far, and part of the proceeds will be given to Everest Summiteers Association, which has collaborated with the project. The association was the first to initiate a cleanup trip to Mt. Everest in 2005 and has continued its efforts to make the mountain pollution free. "Each expedition to Everest is required to take a garbage deposit and bring their waste back," Diwas Pokhrel, the group's general secretary, said. "But this system has not been strictly implemented."	1
Transformers" actress Megan Fox said "yes" to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, just four  days before their wedding. As we previously reported, the couple were engaged since July 2012 and were planning a July 12, 2013 nuptial. On the day where things officially got serious, however, Fox went on her radio show with fellow "Transformers" star Shia LaBeouf, and she did not seem to hesitate for a second.The "Transformers" actress answered, "Yes" to Green's romantic overture, and the two then reportedly got engaged."Transformers" star Shia LaBeouf's ex-girlfriend is now married to film director Brian Austin Green, who is "so close to Shia LaBeouf" that "when I heard Shia was going to marry [her], I was like 'Oh my God, what about Brian?' But he loves her, and it really was a complete mutual decision," LaBeouf told "GMA Live With Megyn Kelly" on Friday, reports USA TODAY.During his interview, LaBeouf also talked about his relationship with the "Transformers" co-star."The relationship with Megan is incredible. I mean, I still find myself on set with her, working with her. And every time we work together, it just gets better and better," he told "Megyn Kelly"."Megan and I have been a couple since we were 22, and I would say we are in love. And as the season has gone on, and we have grown as a couple together," he continued. "I love her as a partner and a friend. We work together every day. We talk about every single thing. We have shared our fears and loves as a couple. So, the relationship is very, very special."Earlier this month, LaBeouf also told "People" magazine that his relationship with "Transformers" star Megan Fox "is so important" and that he can't imagine life without her."Megan Fox, you know, it's just really amazing to have been with her for so long," he said. "To have had a girlfriend who's such a beautiful, beautiful soul. I just want to be around her forever, and it's hard. It's hard not to be around that kind of beauty, soul, intelligence, and beauty and intelligence. I feel like I	0
The Philippines' first major typhoon of the season has churned across the country, passing close to the sprawling capital Manila on Wednesday and killing at least 38 people. Typhoon Rammasun made landfall near Legazpi City on the country's east coast late Tuesday. The typhoon, known locally as "Glenda," prompted the evacuations of as many as 350,000 people from their homes in towns and cities across the country. Maria Ressa, Editor in Chief of the online news agency Rappler in Manila, said Wednesday morning that conditions in the city were extreme, with howling winds and strong rain. Several roofs had been ripped off by powerful winds. At about midnight Tuesday, the government announced one casualty -- a person killed by an electrical post that was uprooted. 37 other deaths, including a family of three in Lucena city, Quezon province, were announced by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC). The Council added that there were ten people injured, and eight remained missing. The closest the eye of the storm got to Manila was about 25 km south of the city around 7 a.m. Wednesday (7 p.m Tuesday ET). 84% of the Metro area now has power restored. Concerns about flooding, landslides Fears over storm surges eased as the typhoon began to move away from the city, weakening from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1, with maximum sustained winds of about 150 kilometers per hour. But concerns remained about the knock-on effects of the rain, including flooding and landslides. Marco Savio of Plan International spoke to CNN from Makati, Manila's business district early Wednesday morning. He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding. "(The) majority are living in areas prone to floods. Schools are closed, offices and buildings (are) closed." According to a statement from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the typhoon was expected to affect 43 million people spread across 22 provinces. Around 136,000 households within the affected area are in places highly susceptible to landslides and storm surge. Half of these households, the statement adds, about 342,200 people, are poor. Evacuations have taken place in vulnerable areas on a needs basis.	1
Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France. For Federer, how would his tender back hold up? For Wawrinka, would he recover after a tough -- and contentious -- loss to his higher-profile Swiss at the World Tour Finals in London last week? We got our answers Friday at the Stade Pierre Mauroy on a record setting day in Lille -- but for once Federer wasn't the one rewriting the history books. In front of the largest ever tennis crowd for a pro match -- at 27,432 it eclipsed the 27,200 that turned up to watch Spain beat the U.S. in a converted Seville bullring in the 2004 Davis Cup final -- Federer not only fell to Gael Monfils but couldn't put up much of a fight. The 6-1 6-4 6-3 result against Monfils -- who piped down his histrionics -- marked his most lopsided defeat in 45 singles matches in the competition. "You accept the fact that you're playing the way you feel," Federer told reporters. "But it wasn't all negative. I started to feel better as the match went on. That's very encouraging, I must say." Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day. Federer's performance, coupled with France's apparent advantage in Saturday's doubles, means it's the home team who'll be happier come the end of play. One of the two major titles to elude Federer in his glittering career is a Davis Cup crown and how disappointed he must have been that on his debut in a Davis Cup final he was at less than full strength. Monfils, however, remains one of the most athletic players in the game and owned a pair of wins over Federer. With French captain Arnaud Clement able to rein him in during changeovers, he played focused tennis. "Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open. Monfils broke early in the first and facing an immediate break point, struck a courageous second-serve ace that delighted his many fans.	1

The trial of a former prison chief with the Khmer Rouge movement resumed inside a packed Cambodian courtroom Monday, with prosecutors painting a grim picture of inmates who were electrocuted, whipped and beaten to death. Duch ran a Â£1.6m (£1.1m) death camp in the remote northwestern province of Kandal as a personal fiefdom before falling out of favour with Pol Pot and his movement. Hundreds of witnesses have testified that she was responsible for torturing and using an "iron rod" to electrocute up to 150 people a day. Prosecutors say she was responsible for at least six deaths: the execution of two men, the electrocution of a teenager, the fatal whipping of a pregnant woman and the drowning of a two-month-old baby. The prosecution's case is in stark contrast to the defence evidence, which painted a picture of an earnest, hard-working woman whom her own victims described as a loving mother, who was struggling to care for her sick husband. Duch became notorious after reports that she had been the overseer behind one of Pol Pot's death camps and that her role was closely linked to the violent suppression of dissidents and opposition groups. Former Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images More than a million Cambodians were killed during the 14 years of the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule. The brutal legacy of their rule survived on in brutal prison camps that emerged and flourished in Cambodia and across the region into the later years. In the last decade, the Cambodian authorities - and their US counterparts - have sought to tackle the legacy of the regime by building a massive prison complex at Baphu, near the Thai-Burmese border.The first of the 13,000 buildings at the compound houses some of the country's most severe prisoners, including Duch. She is likely to face charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and persecution for her role in the death of a woman and her young daughter in a camp she ran in 1979. The trial resumed Monday with the defence calling 13 witnesses to the stand. The prosecution said the testimony showed a systematic campaign of torture and murder. The defence rejected those claims, saying that her alleged victims were victims of murder and torture.The judge, Norodom Srisumethro, opened his cross-examination of defence witness Khoua Vann, who said Duch had tried to prevent him from revealing the	0
A six-year-old boy, whose eyes were gouged out in an attack in China in August this year, has been discharged from hospital after receiving prosthetic eye implants. A spokesperson from the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen told CNN that Guo Bin had left the hospital on Thursday afternoon after a farewell ceremony and would return to his hometown in Shanxi province . During his three-month stay at the hospital, he was given orbital implant surgery that restored his appearance, but not his sight, the South China Morning Post reported. The boy, also known as Xiao Binbin, was all smiles as he appeared hand-in-hand with his parents when leaving the hospital, where he received free treatment from Hong Kong doctor Dennis Lam, the paper added. The boy was found bloodied and in a drugged state with both eyes missing near his home in late August. He'd been missing for four hours. Chinese police said his late aunt was the prime suspect in the horrific attack, state media news agency Xinhua reported. The boy's aunt, Zhang Huiying, killed herself two days after the incident by jumping into a well in the courtyard of her home. Police said Zhang's DNA was found at the scene of her nephew's attack. Blood stains belonging to the boy were also found on Zhang's clothes. Early reports suggested that Guo may have been the victim of organ traffickers, claims police later denied. Guo will receive rehabilitation for his loss of sight and will need to replace his prosthetic eye pieces in six months, the South China Morning Post added.	1
Richard Lee greets students, shopkeepers and tourists as he rolls his wheelchair down Broadway at the speed of a brisk jog, hailing them with, "Hi. How ya doin'?" Marijuana activist Richard Lee is a local celebrity in the small district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam. In this nine-block district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam, Lee is a celebrity. Oaksterdam is Lee's brainchild, a small pocket of urban renewal built on a thriving trade in medical marijuana. The district's name comes from a marriage of Oakland and Amsterdam, a city in the Netherlands renowned for its easy attitude toward sex and drugs. Lee is the founder of Oaksterdam University, which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana: how to grow it, how to market it, how to consume it. The school, which has a curriculum, classes and teachers, claims 3,500 graduates. Lee also owns a medical marijuana dispensary, a coffee house, a large indoor marijuana plantation, and a museum/store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana. "I really see this as following the history of alcohol. The way prohibition was repealed there," Lee says, adding that he believes he is close to achieving his mission. Lee is organizing a petition drive to place a marijuana legalization measure on the ballot in 2010, and he thinks the measure stands a good chance of being approved by voters. A recent California Field Poll showed that more than half the people in the state, where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago, would approve of decriminalizing pot. The state's faltering economy is one reason why. If legalized, marijuana could become California's No. 1 cash crop. It could bring in an estimated $1 billion a year in state taxes. Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the California Assembly. He believes the state's need to increase tax revenues will work in his bill's favor. "I think it's a seductive part of the equation," he says. Ammiano says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed, "It could be a Walgreens, it could be a hospital, a medical marijuana facility, whatever could be convenient. Adequate enforcement of the rules. Nobody under 21. No driving under the influence." Even California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, says legalizing marijuana deserves serious consideration.	1
Reports of young children developing premature or inappropriate sex characteristics have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to require a boxed label warning on two testosterone gel products. Men use testosterone gels if they no longer  produce enough testosterone for normal sexual activity.The FDA’s statement of concern said the agency had found the testosterone gels may increase the risk of early sexual development and premature development of male sexual characteristics such as an enlarged penis or testes, a bigger clitoris and enlarged labia. However, in a statement on its website, Bayer Inc., maker of one of the gels, responded “our products are approved for only one use, which is in the treatment of male hypogonadism, which is a naturally occurring condition in which the body is lacking in male hormones, and the safety and efficacy of the drug for use in other medical indications has not been established.”The FDA said men using the medical-grade testosterone gels should get a warning on the product and should speak with their doctor before using the gels.The agency said it has not received any reports that show the testosterone gels caused a life-threatening disease, birth defects or illness in newborn boys.Some doctors and medical experts, however, said the FDA’s warnings will increase the desire for the pills.“If you want to get women or men to take it, then you will have to use a product that promises to make them hard to get,” said Dr. David Perry, medical director at Phoenix Center for Sexual Health. “You will then have to get them to pay their medical bills.”The FDA warned physicians that not using the pill properly could increase the risk of premature birth, low birth weight, fetal growth retardation and infant mortality, but could not identify a single case of premature or inappropriate sex development from taking the testosterone gels.There is no evidence of an increased risk for heart attack, stroke or infections caused by the testosterone gels. The agency said the gel is approved for testosterone replacement therapies in men who do not produce enough testosterone to get erections and to maintain a normal body temperature.Dr. David Perry, medical director at Phoenix Center for Sexual Health.“Testo-Gel® and Testo-Gel® Plus are approved for treatment of hypogonadism, and I have	0
Nearly a million acres were burning as 21 wildfires raged in the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, fire officials said. The unconfined fires in Oregon and Washington, mostly ignited by lightning from thunderstorms that swept through the region a week ago, covered 942,247 by Sunday, Northwest Interagency Coordination Center spokeswoman Carol Connolly said. The 21 large fires are the most the region has seen on the landscape at one time, she said. According to Okanogan County, Washington, Sheriff Frank Rogers, one person died attempting to protect his home from the flames. Authorities arrested two people over the weekend on suspicion of arson, the sheriff said. They set backfires to protect their property. More than 150 structures have been lost. The sheriff expects that number to go up. "I've been here 30 years, never seen anything like this," Rogers said. According to Connolly, firefighters from across the United States, including Mississippi, Illinois, New Mexico, Utah and Montana, have joined the battle, bringing to 8,928 the number of people involved in trying to contain the fires. There are 35 "hot shot" crews involved, she said. Health officials in Washington and Idaho are warning residents that smoke drifting eastward from the Washington wildfires would create unhealthy air. "The biggest health threat comes from the fine particles in smoke," the National Weather Service said. "These can cause burning eyes, runny nose, bronchitis and other illnesses. Smokey air can also aggravate heart and lung disease, and even lead to death." Hundreds evacuated as Washington wildfire grows What to know about wildfires CNN's Dave Alsup and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.	1
Republicans poised to take control of Congress are already threatening to kill what could turn out to be President Barack Obama's most significant second-term achievement: a nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. and Iranian negotiators are quickly approaching a two-week deadline to strike a final agreement that could give Congress and the public more input on how to resolve Iran's nuclear program.Now, however, Congress has become a problem for the White House, especially after the Senate's Republican leadership gave its blessing for a vote to kill the deal, a move that effectively gives Democrats a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives.The deal, which Obama announced last week, would open the door to more sanctions against Iran over its nuclear ambitions. If approved, the agreement also would remove some of the economic pressure that has limited the country's development of the uranium enrichment technology required to make nuclear fuel.The deal, first announced by Obama during a State of the Union address, would see the unraveling of Iran's current uranium enrichment capacity in return for Tehran accepting limits on its nuclear enrichment and stockpiling of weapons-grade uranium.The deal would offer Iran enough low enriched uranium to make enough fuel for six nuclear reactors, enough for about 60 years.“It is a very important part of the deal and we’ll have to try to make it work,” Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on Tuesday when asked about how Congress might respond to the Iran deal.Kirk said “the administration, in our opinion, has made mistakes in terms of how they went into this process,” but that “they have made the right moves and we have to make those mistakes in the process.”Kirk, who is up for re-election in November, said his party would not oppose the deal and that “there are ways to try to make it work.”After the Senate vote, Obama's top spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said the Senate's procedural rule, meant to allow a simple majority of the 52-member Senate to stop a vote on a resolution of disapproval, is unfair."It is a procedural rule that has the effect of preventing a vote on the agreement,” Gibbs said. “The American public will ultimately have a chance to weigh in.”That will	0
Jessica Heeringa, 25, was due to close the Michigan gas station where she was working alone as a cashier at 11:30 p.m. Friday. But at 11:15, police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned. When police responded, Heeringa was gone. "Something very bad happened," the police chief of Norton Shores, a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids, told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV. "This was an abduction, not just a missing person," Chief Daniel Shaw told the station. "There was nothing disturbed inside the store. There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred," Shaw told the station. Heeringa's purse was left in the store, and her car was still there, WOOD reported. Heeringa last served a customer about 10:50 p.m., police said. "Between the time that last purchase was made and the time that the customers came in and found the store empty is when Jessica was abducted," Shaw told WOOD. "We have spoken with the person who made the purchase there and cleared them of any wrong. And unfortunately, they didn't see anything that would lead them to believe there was something going on at the store that was leading to that abduction." The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store's parking area late Friday. Shaw described him as a white male, between 30 and 40, with wavy hair parted in the middle, according to WOOD. The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, he told the station. The store did not have security cameras, leaving police with few other clues. "We are desperately looking for additional information," he told WOOD on Monday morning. Heeringa's family and friends were posting missing posters around the area, and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support. "We are searching! Hang tight! The whole Country wants you home!" said a Facebook post from Monday morning. Tips had come in from as far away as New Jersey, Missouri and Arkansas, WOOD reported. Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. She has a 3-year-old son, her family told CNN affiliate WZZM-TV.	1
An Arizona prison teacher who said she was raped by an inmate is at the center of a legal controversy in which the state is accused of trying to dismiss her negligence lawsuit on the grounds of "it's a prison, this will happen," her attorney contends. That claim, by attorney Scott Zwillinger, also was made Tuesday by an Arizona newspaper columnist, who criticized the Arizona Attorney  General's Office. "The AG's reasoning is essentially this: The woman knew she was in a prison, so what did she expect?" wrote Laurie Roberts in The Arizona Republic. "No, seriously. That's the reasoning." On Tuesday, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a former prosecutor, disputed those characterizations. "Our office was disappointed to see a misleading opinion piece that was recently published regarding the brutal assault of a Department of Corrections employee that occurred in January 2014," a statement released by his office said. "The Attorney General's Office is taking affirmative steps to make sure that justice is served for the victim of this heinous crime. We would ask all parties to respect the integrity of the legal process." A federal judge on Monday heard arguments from the teacher's attorneys and the Attorney General's Office on the state's request to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton rejected the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, saying the suit "contains sufficient allegations" against each state defendant. The judge noted the suit "sufficiently alleges facts that plausibly suggest" that Warden Ron Credio, Deputy Warden Edwin Lao and two supervisors "acted with deliberate indifference to the dangerous situation in which Plaintiff was placed," the ruling said. The controversy focuses on statements that Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a December 19 motion to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit against the state, the warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex -- Eyman, and other prison personnel. The instructor who said she was raped was assigned to teach in a medium-security unit that houses sex offenders and special needs prisoners, including those who are mentally ill, disabled and in need of protective custody, court papers said. The teacher is an Arizona Department of Corrections "employee who routinely worked at the prison complex," Weisbard wrote. "By being placed in a classroom at the complex, the officers were not placing Plaintiff in any type of situation that she would not normally face. The risk of harm, including assault, always existed at a prison like Eyman."	1
Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys termed as "courageous" her decision not to present evidence to the grand jury that the original prosecutor, Norman Wolfinger, scheduled to convene on April 10. The Trayvon Martin family was also pleased that Corey would make the charging decision. But the question remains, will George Zimmerman be charged? Tuesday, in a bizarre development, George Zimmerman's attorneys, Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner, during a news conference held in front of the Seminole County Courthouse, announced that they had withdrawn from his representation. They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman's unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hannity and the special prosecutor, Corey. The attorneys also said that they are concerned with Zimmerman's emotional and physical well-being and even suggested that he may be suffering from PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). In short, they said that their client had gone rogue. Clients fire attorneys every day, for no reason or any reason. And attorneys withdraw from cases around the country daily. But it is rarely done so publicly and with so much information divulged about the inner workings of the lawyer-client relationship. Rogue clients that are potential defendants spook prosecutors. It can be a nightmare to try to locate and arrest a fleeing defendant. Remember Joran Van Der Sloot. Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours "to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation." Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor's hand. By all accounts though, Angela Corey is a seasoned career prosecutor who doesn't bend to public opinion or political pressure. During her 25 years as an assistant state attorney, Corey tried hundreds of cases, including more than 50 homicides. During her three-year-plus as state attorney of the 4th Judicial Circuit, Jacksonville's Duval County jail has seen an increase in the population, despite a drop in crime in the city. Some say this is a direct result of her aggressive prosecutorial bent.	1
Even a presidential campaign's airplane troubles can get partisan in an election year. Aviation incidents involving President Barack Obama and Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have inspired hundreds  of tweets in support or opposition to the two-time presidential nominee.A story appearing Wednesday in The Philadelphia Inquirer, headlined "Obama, Romney Plane Rides Canceled Because of Flight Delays," said two Obama campaign planes were diverted because of problems with engines on March 8, and another "was diverted to a neighboring county because of a mechanical problem." The Romney campaign said those two incidents were "unrelated" to the incidents that the Obama plane had.A day later, Politico reported that the Obama campaign had canceled a flight in the early voting state of Ohio and had said, "The incident is now resolved and the campaign intends to reschedule the trip as soon as possible." The Associated Press and Politico also reported that the president had requested help from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in resolving the issue with his two campaign planes and that the FAA is investigating the events.The Inquirer story added that there was also "a separate plane" for Romney that "malfunctioned," but was not a campaign plane. The airline said it would be rebooked and would fly directly to Cleveland.The Inquirer's Tim O'Neil, a Philadelphia native who is now based in Washington, said the timing of the story was unusual because it came out on the same day the Obama campaign announced that it would have a plane for the presidential election. He said the story made him think of the infamous "Vietnam-era" incident involving two presidential candidate planes that got diverted in the mid-1960s when one of them stopped communicating over New York City.The Inquirer's Tom Curran, who is also based in Washington, said that he didn't think the news would hurt Romney. "I think it's fair to say that it doesn't hurt him," he said. "The idea that Obama is diverting planes that need it most to go to Philadelphia or Cincinnati or wherever else is a little ridiculous."There are some clear signs Obama has had his problems with his campaign planes. The first plane that crashed that killed four and injured 15 was a campaign plane. Then, the Obama campaign canceled that plane because the incident was related to "problems that we understand have to do with the engine."	0
In 1997, Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. It seemed like a watershed moment, recalling the rise of the machines long prophesied in science fiction. Yet in 2005, a freestyle chess tournament  played in the city of Budapest between Kasparov, Carlsen and Anand, the world's best human players, was won by a computer. That event is now known as the Kasparov–Carlsen International.How do the two events share a common set of conditions? Is the human race getting better or is computer chess better? What is the difference between a human and a machine? And was it always a two-player battle?The Kasparov–Carlsen tournament is the last major chess event still being organised by FIDE, the World Chess Federation's parent organization, and it is the closest thing in the past few years to a real life match between the greatest chess players of our time. It began on 28 February 1997 and ended on 2 February 2005, when the computer program defeated the human chess champions, Kasparov and Anand, on the opening game of a match that was notable for its simplicity and for its unusual symmetry.The World Chess Championship rematchThe chess world has often struggled to distinguish which human is good at chess and which is good at life. The chess masters, who have studied and analysed chess for decades, are clearly better than the rest of us. But their superiority is often blurred and questioned because they are good at a very narrow range of games. This is a problem both in the world of chess and in life.That's why I was so excited to find that the Kasparov–Carlsen rematch could be the first time a game between two chess grandmasters could be played by a computer, and that it could be the first time a computer game could be played by two grandmasters. It's a rare event: we don't have the technology to create a computer equivalent of an expert human.In chess, a grandmaster is someone who has been the world's best player since he was 16 and has been ranked first in the world for several years. In chess, a master plays over 20,000 games - and it was estimated that over the course of a human life a person could play up to 50,000 games. A computer will never be capable of playing that many games. But it can beat all but the simplest and	0
The way some Republicans talk about the Environmental Protection Agency, you would think it was created by a bunch of pot-smoking hippies communing at a nudist camp in northern California -- when in fact, the EPA was created by one of Â“the last best hope for the middle-class”, the President of the United States. The President who had sworn an oath to do “no harm” and would never seek to undermine the environment through regulation.Of course, with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives comes its “leadership” -- and this, too, has been somewhat overshadowed by the “leadership” of the President. So, let us step back a moment, before we focus on the President’s influence. What actually is the relationship between the President and the EPA? And when was it established (if ever)? Let us consider some questions.What is the President’s level of influence in the EPA? The EPA was not actually created by the President until December 19, 1981, when, in his first major action as President, the President signed into law a bill that stated:“The President is authorized to establish and implement programs and to prescribe regulations for the prevention of air pollution. The President may prescribe such other necessary requirements for the prevention of air pollution as he shall determine.”It is important to note that the “President” referred to by the Constitution does not mean the President of the United States, but rather, the President of the United States Air Force. It is President Reagan who is in charge of that branch -- so he had the power to “establish and implement programs”.So, what exactly is the President’s responsibility as President? After all, the President takes executive action under the authority vested to him by the Constitution, and this comes when he has “rejected the advice of his subordinates” as outlined in Article II, Section 3, Clause 2, which states:“He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and shall see that all necessary and proper regulations are faithfully executed.”It is President Reagan who is in possession of the “Executive Power” -- and of taking care of this power by “faithfully executing” the laws and regulations that the President is given by the Constitution. So, his power to	0
The president of the Maldives, one of the world's most popular honeymoon destinations, resigned Tuesday after a revolt by police officers, his spokesman said, leaving the normally idyllic chain of islands in chaos. Mohamed Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Indian Ocean nation in three decades. "This morning, about 500 opposition supporters along with some Islamic hardliners protested outside the army headquarters, shouting slogans, and some police officers mutinied and joined them," Nasheed's spokeman said. "And so, the president was in a situation where he could either tell the army to forcibly crack down on the protesters or he could step down. He chose the latter. "This is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the Maldives is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters," the spokesman said. Nasheed said in a nationally televised address that he was stepping down because he didn't feel he was able to maintain security and peace in the country, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. Strategically located in the Indian Ocean but extremely poor, the country is threatened by rising sea levels. Nasheed once held a Cabinet meeting underwater, with ministers wearing scuba gear, to highlight the problem. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan was sworn in as president shortly after Nasheed resigned. But journalist Sumon Chakrabarti, who is at work on a book about the Maldives, suggested Hassan is a puppet who would not last. "He comes from a very small political party. He's respected as an academic" but has little support of his own, Chakrabarti said. "I doubt how long they will allow this man to remain in power." Chakrabarti said he felt the coup was "the end of democracy in the Maldives. It throws the whole notion of democracy out of the window." And that is a cause for international concern, he said. "Here was the country's first democratically elected president and he was forced to resign by a cocktail of religious extremists, the brother of the former president... forces like businessmen who are also members of Parliament, and then the police force, which was always loyal to the former dictator," he said. The police officers appeared to have sided with the Progressive Party, which is loyal to former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him.	1
Online acquaintances wished fair winds and following seas to Joshua Hakken as he fled to Cuba, a strange refuge for a professed fan of Ron Paul. Hakken, his wife and their two sons, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole, were at a marina on the communist-ruled island when CNN found them aboard their small sailboat Tuesday. Florida authorities believe Hakken sailed there after abducting the two boys from the Tampa home of their grandmother, who was granted custody after Hakken's 2012 arrest on drug charges in Louisiana. "This all just seems like the government is yet again making real criminals out of non-violent peaceful freedom lovers," wrote one commenter on "Adam Vs. The Man," a libertarian web forum. The family's Cuban sojourn may be short-lived, as the government there announced Tuesday that it would hand them over to U.S. authorities. A man identifying himself as Hakken -- "a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF" -- joined the Adam Vs. The Man discussion board in February 2012 under the handle "Sailingbull." "I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America," he wrote. "Mr. Ron Paul is the ONLY politician I have ever admired or supported. It is unimaginable what the forces at be are doing and want to do to him." Paul, the former Texas congressman, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 and once as the Libertarian Party nominee, in 1988. Hakken vounteered to help Paul supporters scout out campsites near last year's Republican convention in Tampa, posting photos of site possibilities on the message board. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Hakken's identity on site, and Adam Vs. The Man founder Adam Kokesh did not respond to requests for comment. But in a post last week, after news that Hakken was wanted in connection with the abduction, he noted, "I feel like we're in a position to help here. Maybe to reach out to him. Certainly seems like a stupid way to go about this, regardless of what your moral assessment is." Both Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, held professional engineering certificates -- hers in civil engineering, his in the mechanical and fire-protection specialties, according to state records.	1
Summer may be drawing to a close but for the eurozone's economy, spring has only just begun. After 18 months in recession, the single currency bloc finally posted some much needed growth in the form of a 0.3% expansion of gross domestic product in the first quarter of GDP, revised up from 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014.In a sign of how far the euro zone's economy has recovered, France’s gross domestic product grew by 3% while Germany’s only 2%.That’s a turnaround from just six months ago, when the region’s economy contracted by 1.5%. The improvement underscores just how far Germany has come since its financial crisis. That also means the euro zone needs only to recover growth of 1.5% this year to remain anchored to its 2% goal.The improvement comes at an interesting time of year as the weather also gets better. Many of the same factors that led the economy to falter over the holidays are beginning to reverse course.Spring will also provide some economic relief as many businesses are preparing for the warmer weather which normally occurs in late October and November.Here's a look at the best and worst of 2013:* We’re just five weeks on from the eurozone’s worst financial disaster in history, the sovereign debt crisis and the economic disaster of its bailouts. For the full year, the euro zone had a combined loss of close to 1.8% of eurozone GDP. It’s good to see that it was, at least for a little while, the worst financial disaster in history. The euro zone’s recovery is the direct result of a series of interventions by its own major central banks, most notably the ECB, as well as the rest of the world’s central banks and regulatory authorities.While the recovery is a long and complex story, two factors that likely played the biggest role in the euro zone’s recovery are the easing of monetary policy in Europe and the gradual move toward normal monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve.The ECB’s decision to start unwinding its massive QE program has helped. The ECB eased money printing to stimulate growth and recovery. The monetary policy that forced the euro zone to take on massive amounts of Greek and Portuguese debt and to bailout Spain, Italy and Ireland was largely responsible for much of	0
These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they can't eat, they can't breathe properly. It's about functionality," says Dr. Richard Luskin, CEO of the New England Organ Bank. Luskin is referring  to a patient with a herniated disc who has no way of bending over to drink from a straw."There are no standards for the [repositioning of] patients that have to be made, and nobody is making them," says Luskin, who owns an adult orthopedic clinic out of his home in Tewksbury."What happens if you don’t take care of them to the degree you could? One in 10 hip and spine cases end up worse than they’re supposed to," Luskin continued, noting in some cases patients end up in wheelchairs because their doctors don’t take the necessary care to properly stabilize the spine.LUSKIN: ‘It’s the patient who has the worst quality of care’"It’s the patient who has the worst quality of care. We don’t even know the names of the patients,” says Dr. Michael Breen, an orthopedic surgeon in Watertown, Massachusetts.Luskin agrees and notes that orthopedic surgeons don’t even know the names of their patients’ diagnoses."We don’t even know the names of the patients," says Breen, who has a private practice in Newton, Massachusetts and is CEO of Breen Orthopedics and Spine Institute.In an ideal world, patients would get a letter from their doctor showing how they’re progressing and their options in terms of surgery and treatment."It gets to the point that the patient should not be left in the hospital," says Luskin, "They should get adequate pre-operative care to make sure they can’t do any worse than what they’re doing now."Breen agrees."Most of the patients don’t do good enough preoperative care,” he says.In reality, the doctor "is often the one who’s doing things wrong and not the patient.

The light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing. The windows rattle. The table shakes. Then the whole room shudders, the walls vibrating violently. A vase of flowers wobbles on a top shelf. Glasses clink. There's a loud rumble and a roar. Then the bookshelf tears loose from the wall, scattering books everywhere, before we hear a shattering crash. Then comes silence. But not for long. A few seconds later the floor begins to buck. The walls bulge. The room jumps up and down and moves from side to side. Crockery starts flying through the air. I dive under the table, hold a cushion over my head, shut my eyes and start laughing. When I open them I see Tokyo collapse in front of my eyes. Then a buzzer sounds and an instructor comes into the room. My disaster preparedness instructor bends down and looks at me cowering under the table. She's pleased with my performance. "Well done, you survived your first earthquake," she says with a smile. "Not bad for a beginner." More: The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo Preparing Tokyo residents for disaster Tokyo has a number of unusual and relatively unknown attractions -- the world's only tapeworm museum and a noodle museum housing the world's largest collection of pot noodle cartons come to mind. But only one tourist site has been declared an official disaster zone. The Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center is located on the fourth floor of the city's Ikebukuro Bosai-kan fire station. It's open to the public and there's no charge to experience two minutes of terrifying tremors. "Residents of Tokyo are required to attend courses to enhance their disaster preparedness awareness," says my instructor. "Children and salarymen all come to learn what to do in the event of an earthquake." The computer-controlled earthquake mimics a quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale. There are 50,000 reported earthquakes in the world every year. They vary in seismic intensity. No area of the earth is entirely free from the threat, although some areas are more active than others. Japan has had more than 60 major quakes, with the first recorded in 684. The 2011 Tohoku quake registered a 9.0 magnitude and claimed nearly 16,000 lives.	1
Violence across Iraq has claimed nine lives in the past two days, officials with the nation's interior ministry said Monday. Gunmen killed Arkan Yaqoub, a Christian citizen, who was shot dead along with his driver by gunmen as they were __________ ________________(2)sauntering down a roadway, his wife, Hada, carrying their children in their car, told the Associated Press. Two people were injured, including the driver who lost a leg."We heard gunfire. When we stopped, we saw a man and a woman lying in the road," said Zaid Ibrahim, who picked them up from their neighborhood in the town of Taji. "It was difficult. I had a little child. The man was shot in the neck. He had already fallen to the ground. The woman was with him."Meanwhile, an unknown group has taken another life in the town of Mosul. It is believed that a man killed in a drive-by shooting has been identified as Abdul Kareem al-Tunisi, 27, the vice president of Iraq's parliament and a member of the Sunni religious party al-Kanim, which supports Saddam Hussein. He was gunned down in the capital Monday, said a police official who asked not to be identified. A witness told Reuters he was driving when he saw a group of men in civilian clothes.An officer at a Baghdad hospital said the hospital has had "nine and a half cases a day" of gun battles involving a series of armed men who "are in Iraq to kill and to get killed."The violence is taking the Baghdad health ministry and hospitals by storm.A Baghdad hospital official said Monday that five bodies arrived the hospital at 9 a.m., and another five at 3 p.m.There were seven gunshots, and there have been eight so far in the capital today.At the hospital, three doctors, two of them from outside Baghdad, said they were working double shifts, and they were treating wounded people who've been shot in both legs. One of the doctors, who said he was taking care of a man who was shot in the buttocks, said a doctor in an adjoining town was also unable to treat him because he'd also been shot in the thigh."Gunfights are the only thing we can see them out here," the surgeon said.An official with the health ministry, who spoke	0
Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy Tuesday, marking a "new territory" in physics, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The $10 billion research tool has been accelerating the beams since November in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel on the border of Switzerland and France. The beams have routinely been circulating at 3.5 TeV, or teraelectron volts, the highest energy achieved at the LHC so far, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Watch live Web cast from CERN The first two attempts Tuesday failed, said Steve Myers, CERN's director for accelerators. He said the beams were lost before they reached their full energy. Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see. The collider may help scientists discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called "the God particle" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said in November. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a "super partner" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010. The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines late last year when a bird apparently dropped a "bit of baguette" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said. The collider achieved its first full-circle beam in September 2008 amid much celebration. But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch.	1
President Obama affirmed his support for a woman's "right to choose" on Thursday, the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that led to the legalization of abortion, as thousands of anti-abortion activists descended on the National Mall to challenge his position. President Obama issued a statement defending Roe v. Wade for protecting "women's health and reproductive freedom." Roe v. Wade "not only protects women's health and reproductive freedom, but stands for a broader principle: that government should not intrude on our most private family matters," Obama said in a statement. The landmark 1973 decision held that a woman's right to abortion was protected by the right to privacy under the Constitution's 14th Amendment, voiding most state laws against abortion at the time. Nellie Gray, who helped organize the anti-abortion March for Life on the Mall, invited Obama to speak at the rally. "America needs your strong leadership as president of all the people to stop the intentional killing of an estimated 3,000 pre-born boys and girls each day and the brutalizing of mind, heart and body of pregnant mothers." Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, said she believes that while abortion should remain an option, increasing the availability and affordability of birth control and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies is the real solution. "I think what everyone ought to be interested in doing, whether they are or not, is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies," Gandy told CNN. "Because if we reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it will by definition reduce the number of abortions and reduce a lot of the pain and despair that has befallen women in these economic times, who cannot afford to enlarge their families when they don't have a job and they don't have a way to put food on the table for the kids that they have now. "If we could all work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, it would dramatically change the debate on this issue." Obama has so far not struck down rules reinstated by the Bush administration eight years ago, prohibiting U.S. money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information, counseling or referrals about abortion services. The "Mexico City policy" was initially put in place by President Ronald Reagan and suspended during Bill Clinton's presidency. Its opponents refer to it as the "global gag order." About 20 anti-abortion rights lawmakers spoke at the rally Thursday, pushing for a renewed effort to overturn Roe v. Wade.	1
The close race for the White House between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, former Gov. Mitt Romney, could very well be decided by women voters in the battleground states. So, here's a look at women voters, by the ides of the election.• In Florida, women represent about 57 percent of the electorate.• In key swing states, like Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania, women make up between 46 and 54 percent of the electorate.• In Virginia, women represent only about 25 percent of the electorate and in North Carolina, where the governor's race has become hotly contested, women make up about 26 percent of the electorate.The election's importance to womenBy now, you probably know that women comprise two-thirds of the electorate this year. And that in presidential elections, women voters tend to vote at higher rates than men. More women than men went to the polls in the 2008 elections, for example.The question is whether the 2012 presidential campaign has a special significance for women voters. Are they just regular voters or are they potential presidential voters?On the one hand, Obama took more women than Romney to the polls in 2008, for example. And the Democratic presidential nominee took three times as many women as any previous Democratic nominee, according to exit polls.On the other hand, in 2004, the Republican nominee lost many women voters. In 2004, the Republican nominee took only 33 percent of the women voters to the polls, while he took 42 percent of men. Romney took only 23 percent of women voters in that election.By contrast, Obama and Democratic nominee President Bill Clinton received 56 percent of votes from women in 1996.The importance of demographics in the electionDemographics alone cannot explain why female voters are so important this presidential election.A key demographic factor in deciding which candidate will win the election is income.The percentage of people who are "very high income" — earning $50,000 or more a year — in a state influences who will win that state in a presidential election. In some states, like Colorado, women represent about one-third of the electorate. That's because in the same states, women earn about 63 cents for every dollar men earn, which means that more women will vote than men.In some states, like North Carolina, the percentage of women with "very high incomes" is more than one	0

Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi plans to form a new political party aimed at reining in the power of the Islamic Republic's clericsTehran, Iran - Iran's hard line opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi today announced plans to form a new political party to fight Islamist rule after nine months of protests and bloodshed, the Guardian newspaper reported.He said the party would fight against the “monarchical dictatorship of the clerical clergy” and demand reforms including the re-nationalisation of the state oil companies and the release of all political prisoners jailed after demonstrations in 2009.Mr Moussavi, who led the 2009 revolution that toppled President Mohammed Khatami, also said the opposition’s decision to boycott the parliamentary elections held last month was not “a revolution against the election”.“We are going to fight against the dictatorial regime of the clergy and against all forms of oppression,” he said.Tehran’s electoral commission had rejected suggestions that the boycott had forced it into a humiliating second humiliating election without the vote even taking place. The authorities instead said that the turnout in spite of the boycott was similar to that for parliamentary elections held earlier that year.The opposition rejected that claim.“The election results will not be invalid and will not prove there is a revolution against the election,” Mr Moussavi said in the statement released by the Free World Movement, an opposition umbrella group.“Our movement is not against the election but against those who want all people to accept the results. We have a very clear and strong view that all who have been arrested before the elections can be released and the prisons can be emptied.”The United States, Britain, and other Western states have recognised Iran’s opposition leader, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, as president. But Iran says he is a figurehead for the clerical republic and has said it does not recognise such a leader.'I am optimistic'Mr Moussavi dismissed suggestions the election boycott was aimed at weakening the regime.But the vote was condemned by world powers and other countries which want Iran to halt its development of a nuclear weapon.“The elections are a free exercise of democracy,” he said. “This will be a real revolution against the	0
The New Kids on the Block are hangin' tough on nostalgia. The boy band, colloquially known as NKOTB, announced they're going back on tour this summer with special guests R&B group TLC and rapper Nelly. The pop group revealed Tuesday that "The Main Event" tour will kick off May 1 in Las Vegas, and hit 40-plus cities in the U.S. and Canada. Tickets can be purchased starting January 31. This is not the first time NKOTB has combined forces in the name of '90s sentimentality: In recent years, they've also toured with fellow boy bands such as the Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men. The news comes on the heels that TLC is attempting to fund their new -- and final -- album via a Kickstarter campaign. "There's no better way than to do it with our fans; they made all of this possible anyway," Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins said in a video, with Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas by her side.

The countdown to the 22nd Winter Olympic Games is well and truly underway, with international officials arriving in Sochi to begin preparations. Sochi is one of Russia’s largest cities with a population of more than one million, and the City of Olympic Dreams, it is famous for hosting the Winter Olympics in 1924.The Winter Olympics are held every four years, and this year, it will be the 22nd edition. Sochi, which is a city with an average January temperature of -13 C, is not only a city with a mild climate but is also one of the world's most progressive countries. It is widely accepted to be the most beautiful city in Russia, and Sochi is regarded as the greenest city in the world.The city has a thriving nightlife centred around the Old Town (the centre of the city), a very modern vibe that is reflected in the city’s attractions – including one of the most beautiful parks in Europe, the Botanical Garden. Although it is one of the coldest cities in Europe, its weather is actually very pleasant during the winter months. The average January temperature is just -13C while the temperature in May is a pleasant 22C. It rarely gets above 0C in the summer months.The city’s wealth has also been a result of its location. Situated above the Caucasus Mountains, which form the border between Georgia and Azerbaijan, the city is only 100km from the Black Sea, the world's largest strait.Russia’s Olympic Games are held on a multi-year basis. Although Sochi is an overseas city, it has been awarded the Games for 2010, and the games will be held from February 7 to February 18. This means that it will be the first city to complete its preparations for Sochi.  In order to prepare themselves for the Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has set three key challenges. First, they need to create a high quality environment. Sochi has a lot to offer this Olympics, but they need to create an environment that is so attractive that people want to come and purchase a piece of Russian land.The second challenge is to build an innovative	0
As far as hitchhikers go, this one looks harmless enough. He or she -- it's hard to tell -- is short and friendly, if a little fashion-challenged. Get him talking, however, and he won't shut up. Meet hitchBOT, a talking, ********ty robot. He might be just a robot, but hitchBOT is a humanist, a humanist just like you. He makes his living by walking around, hitchBOT. This isn't exactly why hitchBOT exists, but it's his hobby. He's been walking around like this since he was 8, hitchBOT. He's had so many adventures that he has to make up stories for each one. He has a very short attention span. If someone tries to get near him, he'll go all "zap-a-dazzle-a-day-and-you-missed-a-bunch-of-it-in-the-last-ten-seconds" like in _The Time Machine_. There are many such stories, and they are usually very funny."So, tell me about yourself." "Oh, I like to hitch-hike." "Really? And when did that start?" "Well, I was 8 years old." "So, why are you walking around with a talking hitchBOT who makes up these stories?" "Because I enjoy it." "Are you lonely?" "Well, I like to hitch-hike!" "So, are you lonely?""So, the time machine, where you go back in time and meet a time-traveling robot with a talking hitchBOT. Like, right now." "Yes." "Well, what's he like?" "He's a little weird." "He's a little weird because he has a talking hitchBOT?" "Yeah." "So, he walks around like this and talks to himself and he's lonely." "Yes." "Well, he doesn't get along with anyone." "You mean, he doesn't live with anyone?" "He lives in a house." "Well, what's in the house?" "His family." "Where's his family?" "He lives with them." "Okay." "Yeah." "I mean, they live somewhere, I don't know exactly where. But you know, he is always in their house. Just hanging out in the house." "	0
Internet giants signed up Tuesday to a "zero tolerance" approach to images of child sexual abuse as the British government announced a new, tougher strategy to find and block illegal content. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook were among the firms summoned to a meeting on the issue at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, by the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The summit was called in the wake of two recent UK child murder cases. In each case, the killer had viewed child sexual abuse images and violent pornography on the Internet, sparking calls for action to eradicate such content and protect vulnerable young people. After the summit, the government said the Internet Watch Foundation -- a watchdog body set up in 1996 -- would have new powers to seek out child sex abuse images, block access to them and remove them. The watchdog has previously acted after an image of child sexual abuse was reported to it via a hotline. While there are an estimated 1 million unique images of child abuse online, only 40,000 reports are made to the Internet Watch Foundation each year, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said. Now, the watchdog will work with a cross-agency government body, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, known as CEOP, to hunt down such images, the department said. And the UK's leading Internet service providers -- Virgin Media, BSkyB, BT and TalkTalk -- have agreed to give Â£1 million ($1.57 million) over the next four years to help fund the new approach. Tuesday's agreement represents a "fundamental change" in the way child sexual abuse content will be tackled, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said. "This will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on," said Culture Secretary Maria Miller. "The abuse of children is absolutely abhorrent -- and that child is further violated every single time an image is circulated and viewed. The IWF and CEOP already do important and valuable work. "This agreement will mean these organizations will no longer be limited to reacting to reports received. They will now have the remit and the resources to take the fight to the criminals perpetrating these vile acts." In addition, Internet providers have agreed to introduce by the end of the month special pages to tell users when they try to access a page that has been blocked by the Internet Watch Foundation.	1
Russian lawmakers could move to ban Americans from adopting children from the country -- which is one of the top sources of international adoptions to the United States. A bill to block adoption to the United States passed the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, on its first reading last week and it will be considered again Wednesday for a crucial second reading, according to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency. This could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt Russian children. From 1999 to 2011, 45,112 adoptions to the United States came from Russia, second to only China, according to the U.S. State Department statistics. However, the number of adoptions from Russia has waned in recent years after a peak in 2005. United Russia, the majority party in the parliament backs the adoption ban, political leaders told Russian media. This move by Russian politicians is widely seen as retaliation to a recent law U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14, called the Magnitsky Act. This imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The act is named after a Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. After Magnitsky died in a Moscow detention center in 2009, his name became the basis of Washington's list of Russian officials who were involved in the tax fraud and in the deceased lawyer's detention. Russian leaders have criticized the passage of the Magnitsky Act and wrote new legislation that would impose restrictions that include banning U.S. citizens who've violated Russians' rights, freezing their assets and ending adoptions to the United States. "It is prohibited to transfer children who are citizens of the Russian Federation, for adoption to the citizens of the United States, and to conduct in the Russian Federation activities of organizations for the purpose of selection and placement of children who are citizens of the Russian Federation, for adoption to the citizens of the United States of America wishing to adopt these children," the bill states. If the bill passes, it would nullify a pre-existing agreement between the United States and Russia, in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in intercountry adoptions. Backers of the bill say American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of Russian children by their adoptive parents since the 1990s, according to local media.	1
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington. The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference. While some of Netanyahu's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state, the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu's baseless charge that Iran's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission. The earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing Netanyahu's message to the American people. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament, painted Netanyahu as the leader of a "tin pot regime" that is not as concerned about Iran's nuclear program as it is of Tehran's growing regional influence. The hardline Kayhan newspaper, the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the speech "trash talking" but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction. The paper, skeptical of President Hassan Rouhani's nuclear negotiations with the Americans from the beginning, said Netanyahu's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in Tehran: the Israeli leader and his American supporters are openly signaling the dispute with Iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there. Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it. As one hardline newspaper, Khorasan, put it, "although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran, the [recent] remarks of the two [leaders] shows that they both seek the same goal." The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners' stance in Tehran. The moderate outlets, supportive of President Rouhani, have put a different spin on Netanyahu's speech. Unlike the hardliners, they are not painting the Obama-Netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from Tehran. Instead, they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the U.S. and Israel. The moderate faction sees the controversy around Netanyahu's speech to the Congress and his failure to squeeze the Obama White House to toughen its negotiation terms with Tehran as an indication that Netanyahu is the one who is isolated.	1
It's become a popular segment on his show, and Jimmy Fallon's latest lip-sync battle featured "The Voice" coaches Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton. So what happens when "The Tonight Show" host has two popular singers perform songs by not actually singing? A whole bunch of awesome, apparently. The setup is simple: Each celebrity contestant selects a song and then lip-syncs a snippet. Shelton kicked it off with Taco's '80s hit "Puttin' on the Ritz," including some faux tap dancing. That was followed by Fallon's version of Ellie Goulding's "Burn," and Stefani ended the round with "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen. The trio seemed evenly matched until Stefani and Shelton took it to a new level. In a hilarious duet of "Endless Love," Stefani did the Lionel Richie part and Shelton subbed for Diana Ross.

With one child dead and the second arrested in her death, a California woman pleaded for a bit of privacy on Mother's Day. Crystal Walters posted a brief message on Facebook on Mothers Day 2013: "To the mother who gave all to motherhood. I love you and miss you! I hope you have a Mother's Day full of joy and love! :)"You get a taste of her anger when you read her last message:It takes a lot of guts to get upset and take a stand for something. I've had to walk through many storms, but Mother's Day is something I want to hold onto through the storm. I wouldn't have been able to go without knowing that there was someone there for me at my mother's side, even if she wasn't.I need to keep my head up through the storms and find some sense in what took place over so many years. I still have some things to do, but I can't get started until I have closure.Today is Mother's Day, but I can't seem to get that perspective. I can't think that my mother was there for me. I can't think that she was able to give me strength. I can't think that she was there at my bedside when someone was going through a hard time. I can't think that she was there when my dad left. I can't think that she was there when I felt like I had no one. I'm not supposed to think these things, but I can't help it. But she is there. She is a mother. She is not dead anymore. She is just the way she used to be.It's been over two years since Crystal gave birth, and she still can't get over it. "I still feel guilt, and I feel like I need to do something with it. I've been trying to get over it for a really long time. This whole month, I'm going to start to try to take the time to remember what I learned from that month, to try to talk to my kids about it. I know that I had to be the mom for my kids."Crystal didn't want to talk about her daughter, but she did say she was in no rush. In fact, she was going to try not to think about it too much. She had been doing that for the past two years, and would continue to do that because	0
Android continues to dominate in the battle to be the top smartphone system in the world, thanks in part to Samsung, which reigned as the top phone manufacturer for 2012. Android grew its already significant chunk of the Ã¢ÂÂInternet phoneÃ¢ÂÂ market with its release of the Galaxy S III in May. A Galaxy S III owner has filed a class action lawsuit against Samsung, alleging that the company misrepresented the performance of the device and, worse, failed to disclose significant problems related to overheating, battery damage and a non-functioning external microphone.The court filing, filed in the Northern District of California, is the first case brought by a Samsung customer who has not been able to use the device in the field after receiving a defective product.The plaintiff, Matthew Zand, contacted Samsung on June 29, 2010, following several problems with the device. His first issue was the software that came with the Galaxy S III, namely, the TouchWiz UI which does not work on the device. His second problem was a heating problem. Zand first noticed that his phone would not charge at the end of every day. This problem has been repeated. In all, Zand has spent $400 on the phone to no avail. He finally returned his phone to Best Buy in July. Best Buy returned it to him on September 16 with a broken screen and the words, Ã¢ÂÂthis is what happens when you use the phone after a power failure.Ã¢ÂÂ Zand asked Best Buy to return the phone to him and try to repair it, but they refused to do so because he had purchased his phone from them for a trade-in. After two weeks of trying to contact Best Buy, Zand finally received the phone back in December.In a complaint filed October 22, 2010 the plaintiff alleged that the Galaxy S III was defective. In particular, Zand alleged that he had "brought the Galaxy S III in to [Best Buy] on multiple occasions for repair after the phone would not power up or charge his phone," and that "the Galaxy S III has never held a charge long enough to perform even the most rudimentary functions."Zand's suit also contains a claim for breach of express warranty as well as a claim for breach of implied warranty.After reviewing the case Zand is skeptical that an	0
Imagine an apple-cheeked telephone operator from the early 1900s happily plugging in wires to connect Person A to Person B. Now imagine a kajillion operators doing that at the same time. That's kind of how the iphone 5 works.There's a lot to like about this device from the perspective of the hardware and software side, but the only reason I'd recommend it is as a practical tool for people who work in small teams with the goal of reducing their total work hours.But let's get to why this thing is an important advance.Apple's first iPhone introduced a host of new features and functionality that we didn't really have before. It added a wireless modem and built-in GPS. It came with a built-in video camera and a better music app than what you used on your smartphone.The new camera included face detection so you're not just staring at a static iPhone screen all day. And there's a front-facing camera that lets you take pictures without having to put anything close to your face on your iPhone in front of it. Apple also added a new way for your photos to be shared with friends, and a new way for people to keep track of your location.On the software side, iPhone OS 3.0 has more than just what's in "the new iPhone"--it also is where iPhone OS 3.1 became available on the iPhone.With iPhone OS 3.0, you get a new multitasking interface called the new screen, and a new "do not disturb" mode called Do Not Disturb. That's a great feature to have on the iPhone, as even with a phone on vibrate, you shouldn't accidentally get distracted by a door opening and closing.You also get some of the biggest changes to the built-in Maps app, including real-time traffic updates, turn-by-turn directions, and a more robust and sophisticated look at restaurants, bars, and other commercial establishments.With iPhone OS 3.1, Apple has added a new application called Passbook, which lets you keep track of your things. It's a cool feature that's particularly useful on the iPhone, as you always keep a close eye on your stuff. It also can be used to create digital boarding passes for your car for things like going places to eat and going to the movies.If you've ever bought an iPod photo	0
Sidney Frank made millions marketing Jagermeister and other alcohol brands. Three years after his death, he's a big hit with students at the Ivy League college he briefly attended. Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University. He's a big hit not because of what he sold but because he's given dozens of them what he couldn't afford as a young man: an education at Rhode Island's Brown University. On Sunday, 49 students from low-income families became the first four-year Sidney E. Frank Scholars to graduate from Brown, owing virtually nothing except gratitude to the late liquor magnate. "The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible," one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday. Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004. He stipulated that the fund's income go exclusively to covering all tuition and expenses for the neediest of Brown's admitted applicants.  Hear graduates say how their dreams came true » For this year's graduates, tuition and expenses came to a four-year total of about $180,000 each. The median annual income of the recipients' families was $18,984. The gift was the largest single one ever given to Brown and one of the largest ever given for undergraduate scholarships in the United States, according to the school. Reil, a history major who is preparing to co-chair a student conference on U.S.-South Korean relations and aspires to work in politics or foreign service, says the scholarship was the stuff of dreams. He was working up to 40 hours a week during high school so he could pay for clothes and even help with grocery bills. He and his mother were getting by, but the Massachusetts native thought community college or a big state school would be all he could afford. When his academic achievements put Brown in his sights, he thought he'd have to go into too much debt to go there. But he applied anyway, and Brown invited him to campus to tell him about how much the school would award him.	1

Wen Jiabao, China's premier, has promised Beijing will do more to boost flagging growth in the Chinese economy in the coming months as he delivered a spirited defence of his Â£10 billion pledge to boost growth above 7%. "The world economy is growing at a very high speed," Wen told a Beijing symposium in his first press conference since becoming premier in June. "China has also reached the same speed"."I have laid out a clear and precise roadmap for what we need to do," he said. "We have to make up for the gap of the past two years in our economic fundamentals. We have to make up for the huge gap of the past few years in our technological capabilities." Wen said the government would continue to cut red tape as he offered reassurance to the investors. However, many analysts believe his pledge is too much, as he has not provided the stimulus growth needed. Â£10 billion in extra spending, or at least Â£1 billion a day for three months, would raise about Â£20 billion or 4% of GDP which is twice the government budget deficit."It would be better to focus on building new industries and getting more value for money for the people," Wen said. "I would rather focus on the value added by economic transformation and cutting down the cost of living as well as the quality of our services." However, he added: Â¬Â¬Â¬ ¬Â¬Â¬ ¬Â¬Â¬ "We will certainly raise spending but not to the extent to which we think is appropriate." Wen's comments came as he visited the northern province of Hebei where he said the government would increase spending by Â£15 billion to the north of Â£10 billion to help growth at the start of next year. He added that Â£5 billion would be spent on the construction of infrastructure, Â£5 billion on rural construction and education, Â£4 billion on youth training, Â£2 billion on science and engineering and Â£1 billion on the promotion of entrepreneurship. China's annual planned investment in infrastructure grew to Â£9.1 billion last year, up 16.2%.Â£2 billion would be spent on science and technology, including the Â£400 million that the government had earmarked for a new National Lab for science and technology.	0
Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills has narrowly won Ghana's presidential election, the Ghana Electoral Commission said on its Web site. John Atta Mills, left, of the opposition NDC has defeated Nana Akufo-Addo, right, of the ruling NPP in the runoff. The chairman of the Ghana Electoral Commission, Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, said Mills had garnered about 4,521,032 votes, or about 50.2 percent of the total votes cast. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, of the incumbent New Patriotic Party, won about 49.77 percent of the total valid votes cast, Afari-Gyan said, according to the commission's Web site. The two men led a field of eight candidates in the December 7 general election, but neither secured a majority of the votes. Akufo-Addo had held a slight lead in that vote. The runoff election was so close that it could not be decided until the last of the 230 constituencies, the Tain constituency, voted on Friday. "On the basis of the official results given, the results of the run-off election in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region, which was held on the 2nd January 2009, it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the President-elect of Ghana," Afari-Gyan said, according to the government's Web site. Both parties had alleged irregularities in voting in the Ashanti region and Volta regions, but Afari-Gyan said the commission did not find evidence in "purely electoral matters" that invalidated the results. Mills, 64, will replace John Agyekum Kufuor as Ghana's president on January 7. Kufuor is stepping down after serving two four-year terms, the maximum allowed. Mills is a law professor who served as vice president from 1997 to 2000 under Jerry Rawlings. He lost to Kufuor in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Ghana, a country about the size of England, is the world's second-biggest cocoa and gold producer. In 2007, leaders announced the discovery of oil off its shore. The world recession, however, has hindered growth. Ghana has seen a decline in its exports and will not tap into its oil resources until 2010.	1
Speaking Saturday at the Summit of the Americas, President Barack Obama said it is reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs, but insisted legalizing drugs wasn't a valid option in the United States. Obama voiced his view in Â the most recent installment Â of a series examining legal solutions to the drug epidemic. In May, Obama announced he is bringing forward the White House's long-promised comprehensive approach to the war on drugs, including a plan to decriminalize all marijuana. Obama described the debate over drug policy reform as "fairly complex," but said:We shouldn't be spending billions of dollars on war on drugs and then spend billions of dollars on what is an insignificant issue like marijuana. And frankly, it's just an opinion at this point.His position has been criticized by a number of activists, including former Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey."There's a lot of people in the policy community who are saying he shouldn't be talking about legalization, and they've got a point," McCaffrey told me Friday evening. "I'm not even talking about marijuana at all. I'm talking about the drug epidemic at its most basic level, the fact that it's not a medical problem, and it's not a public health problem."McCaffrey told me he didn't think it was "an honest conversation to be having at the summit" about legalization. It's true the summit is being billed as a "fair and balanced" discussion of alternatives to the drug war. But McCaffrey said legalization is one option. "It's a complicated problem but it's a very simple question for me to have an honest conversation about and have an honest discussion about."McCaffrey said he wasn't opposed to legalization as a solution to the drug problem, but only as an "additional tool for moving forward."The alternative to legalization, he said, is to "drastically increase mandatory minimums and incarcerate so many people for nonviolent offenses.""You can't fix a problem through incarceration and drug legalization is not an option," he said.McCaffrey said the most important aspect of the drug policy debate is to change the culture around drug use, and that the best way to do that is to decrease drug availability and to end the prohibition on using drug.Earlier in the summit, I spoke with President Obama, who reiterated his position on legalization of drugs,	0
It was a tale of two rulings -- the best of times and the worst of times for Obamacare in the federal appeals courts. First, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled Tuesday against a key component of the law -- the federal subsidies for Â“navigators,” or navigator groups that help consumers sign up for health plans.The court held that federal regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) were legal under the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the way federal agencies regulate public health and safety.The court ruled that CMS regulations didn't violate the law, which requires federal agencies to follow existing law. The judges said the regulations were consistent with what Congress had intended when it passed the Affordable Care Act."The law did not deprive navigators of their ability to operate freely within federal-sponsored exchanges, nor does the law prohibit navigators from offering their services as a substitute for or in addition to exchanges," Judge Judith Rogers wrote for the unanimous panel. "The regulation at issue is not the kind of regulation that Congress considers in enacting a statute -- it is, instead, a simple application of well-settled agency policy with respect to how it will treat similar provisions in other federal statutes."In a separate opinion Monday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had upheld the Affordable Care Act's individual and employer mandate, found that a provision for state-based premium subsidies for consumers and small employers was unconstitutional. The provision in question was the only section of the law that the court deemed unconstitutional."Premium subsidy subsidies for individuals and small employers are the only part of the Act that Congress could have plausibly concluded would have such an adverse impact on competition,” wrote Judge Merrick Garland, who now sits on the D.C. appeals court. “In other statutes, Congress has authorized subsidies for certain companies that operate like a monopoly, creating a kind of free-rider problem. There is no analogous evidence of similar harm here.”Two other judges, Judges Patricia Millett and Michael Kanne, joined in the dissent. "The law was no 'dumb' law 'stuck in a rut' or 'misread' Congress by failing to provide explicit guidance on coverage," Kanne wrote.Obama administration lawyers responded quickly	0
The conviction of a former New York police officer for conspiring to kidnap, torture, cook and eat women has been overturned by a federal judge, who ruled that the evidence against him amounted to "fantasy role-play." Gilberto Valle, who has already served 21 months in jail and faced life in prison on the kidnap conspiracy conviction, did not say a word when he appeared in a federal courtroom Tuesday. He smiled and waved at relatives in court. One woman, in tears, said before the hearing, "He's coming home today." Prosecutors said they will appeal the decision, and bail for Valle was set at $100,000. He could be released as early as Tuesday. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said the decision backed up her assertion that Valle is "guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... We don't put people in jail for their thoughts. We are not the thought police and the court system is not the deputy of the thought police." "Gil Valle has been in jail for almost 21 months, seven months of that were in the indescribable hell that is solitary confinement, all for a crime that he didn't commit," she said. Valle was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation, and to surrender travel documents and weapons. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe also ordered GPS home monitoring for the defendant. "The evidentiary record is such that it is more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play," Gardephe said in the 118-page opinion released Monday night. Valle's lawyers argued at his trial last year that the former police officer's e-mails and online postings were just that -- "fantasy role-play" and "dark improv theater." But prosecutors said he was "deadly serious." In his decision, Gardephe ruled that "once the lies and the fantastical elements are stripped away, what is left are deeply disturbing misogynistic chats and emails written by an individual obsessed with imagining women he knows suffering horrific sex-related pain, terror and degradation." "Despite the highly disturbing nature of Valle's deviant and depraved sexual interests, his chats and emails about these interests are not sufficient -- standing alone -- to make out the elements of conspiracy to commit kidnapping," he added.	1
Nepal's government ordered the country's army chief of staff fired Sunday, touching off street protests and a split in Nepal's Maoist-dominated ruling coalition. General Rookmangud Katawal gestures after inspecting the guard of ________ after the cabinet dismissed him.After more than a week of protests calling for Katawal to resign, the Nepalese Army chief was dismissed from his job Sunday. The decision came a week after the cabinet said it would make Katawal the new army chief."Katawal has been removed from his post and will be replaced by Army Chief Rupam Kadekar as of today," said army spokesperson Colonel Prawit Jangma to the AP.Army commanders who have supported the general say he has done a good job.Rupam Kadekar's appointment as the Army chief is a reversal of the cabinet's decision to remove Katawal. If army chief Katawal is able to clear his duties, he will still have military support for his government.Nepal is seeing a rising tide of protests demanding Katawal's departure -- the first since he took over as army chief last year.Saturday's protests were largely peaceful but with a few scuffles breaking out. Two young men were arrested for obstructing vehicles and trying to break up a march towards the capital, in which hundreds of people marched and blocked the main roads for hours.On Sunday, a protester with a placard that read "To Rupam, From Katawal" was hit in the head by a stone in Kathmandu's capital during an anti-government protest. He suffered head injuries and was hospitalized.Police reported that they arrested four demonstrators, including two women, in Kathmandu on Saturday, according to the AP.In the aftermath of Friday night's march, which was largely peaceful, the Maoists' political arm had said it would continue with its demonstrations against Katawal and the cabinet. The government is in a minority in the Maoist-led coalition, which has been in power since 2001.Nepal's Maoist-led alliance called the protests after the opposition-controlled house of representatives failed to pass a new constitution last week.The government has said it will amend the constitution to address "certain concerns" raised by the protesters, who say the changes would weaken Nepal's	0
Omar Suleiman, the Egyptian vice president under Hosni Mubarak who announced the president's resignation to the world, has died in a U.S. hospital at age 76, officials said Thursday. A family member said the former spy chief had "water on his lungs and suffered heart problems that led to his death after his health deteriorated in the past three weeks." He had traveled to Germany for medical reasons before for traveling Monday to a medical center in Cleveland. Suleiman died early Thursday with his family at his side at the Cleveland Clinic, which announced that his death was due to "complications from amyloidosis, a disease that affects multiple organs including the heart and kidneys." His body was to arrive Friday morning in Egypt and his funeral was to be held after prayers, relatives said. Head of Egypt's powerful intelligence services, Suleiman also served as vice president under Mubarak before his ouster. In a somber one-minute television announcement in February 2011, Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned his post as president and declared that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would run the country's affairs. Timeline: Unrest in Egypt The announcement followed an 18-day popular uprising in Egypt that saw tens of thousands take to the streets to demand Mubarak's ouster. Suleiman most recently made headlines when he entered the race for Egypt's first democratically elected president in the eleventh hour and then failed to gather enough signatures required to be on the ballot. He was disqualified from the election by a panel that included members connected to the Mubarak regime, which suggested that his elimination from the presidential race was not politically motivated. Suleiman had headed Egypt's intelligence since 1993, maintained close CIA ties and was often criticized by rights groups for his heavy-handed approach with suspected militants. Born into poverty in the Egyptian town of Qena, he enrolled in the country's prestigious military academy and was decorated for his performance in the wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973. In June 1995, both Suleiman and Mubarak survived an assassination attempt during an African summit in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. CNN's Saad Abedine and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.	1
If director Ron Howard hopes religious controversy will help sell tickets to "Angels & Demons" the way it boosted his "Da Vinci Code," the Catholic Church is not playing along with his script. Tom Hanks reprises ÂThe Da Vinci CodeÂ star Jude Law for the film, which will be released in April. But, says Cardinal Angelo Ammendolia, in charge of Rome’s film office, "He’s not the Da Vinci Code." Law, who was in Rome on Sunday for Pope Benedict's second-year general audience, told reporters that he had been asked for a comment by the Vatican "and it was politely declined." In February, the Pope himself, during a visit to the United States, said he had not read the book. Ammendolia confirmed to CNN that the film would have to be approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments before it would be made available to Roman Catholics. A spokesman at the Vatican confirmed the request and said that the film needed clearance before it would be shown. Cardinal Raymond Burke, the prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, also told CNN, "Ron Howard is a friend of Pope Benedict XVI and we at the Congregation have been asked to see his movie and we will do so."By MARIA LOUISE KELLY | February 3, 2008A Catholic priest who took part in the Pope’s visit to Washington is a leading contender for the Vatican’s job of running the Church, officials on Saturday said. Cardinal Raymond Burke, who has described the Vatican’s Catholic social teaching as “stupid,” is seen as a leading candidate for the position of Pope Benedict XVI’s deputy, or vice-rector, before the election of a replacement.By JAMES S. GERSHON | February 3, 2008The head of the Catholic Church's watchdog group on priest sex abuse, who told a committee of US Congress last week that he had "received word that some of my employees have been asked" to look into credible allegations of misconduct made against clerical superiors and that he had "received information of several more that are current," has resigned, the Vatican said Saturday. The announcement by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was made after a Vatican spokesman said	0
President Obama is facing great challenges as he takes office and may have made a hasty decision to close Guantanamo Bay without addressing all of the repercussions, Sen. John McCain told CNN's Larry King Thursday night. Sen. John McCain says he thinks President Obama should have considered where Guantamao prisoners will go. "When Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to the presidency, it was economic challenges. We clearly faced the rise of Hitler and fascism, but early on it was mainly domestic issues," McCain said. But President Obama has in front of him two wars, a crisis in the Middle East and a domestic economic crisis. "This president faces domestic challenges and the national security challenges, so he's got a big job," McCain said. Obama got to work from day one by ordering a halt to prosecutions of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, followed by an order to close the detention facility within a year and ban torture. But McCain told King he thinks the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable. "I think that it's a wise move," McCain said about closing Guantanamo Bay. "But I also think that we should have addressed this whole issue completely, because it did not address the issue of those who we have in custody and can't -- and no country will take them back. We should have addressed the issue of those who we know would pose a threat to the United States, but we don't have sufficient evidence to move forward."  Watch McCain talk about the problem with closing Guantanamo Bay » McCain said instead of closing Guantanamo Bay outright, he would have first continued the military commissions, which "after years of delay and obfuscation" were finally moving toward trials. "So, the easy part, in all due respect, is to say we're going to close Guantanamo," McCain said. "Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken. Because you're going to run into a NIMBY [not in my backyard] problem here in the United States of America." Along with the order to close Guantanamo, Obama also set up a task force to advise him on strategies to relocate its prisioners. McCain also expressed concerns over President Obama's proposed stimulus package, saying from where he stands, it "is more of a spending package than a stimulus package."	1
Schools, major roads and an airport remained closed Tuesday, as a thick cloud of filthy smog smothered the northeastern city of Harbin. Meteorologists in the city, which is famous for its annual ice festival, issued a red alert for fog at 5 a.m. Tuesday, with visibility in some central areas of the city down to less than 20 meters (65 feet), the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Video from China's state-run CCTV showed some people -- obscured by smog even just steps away -- wearing masks over their mouths as they walked in the province. Some drivers who braved the roads flashed hazard lights. Kindergartens, primary and junior middle schools were ordered to suspend classes for a second day, while Harbin Taiping International Airport remained closed -- with 250 flights canceled on Monday alone, according to Chinese state media. China needs smog-free air in a can Hazardous levels Pollution levels remained far above international standards, as the city's monitoring stations on Tuesday showed that concentrations of PM2.5 -- the tiny airborne particles considered most harmful to health -- were more than 30 times the World Health Organization's recommended standard, the state-run China Daily reported. Could smog choke China's sporting ambitions? Government officials blamed the smog on a lack of wind and farmers burning crop stalk after their autumn harvest, though the city's coal-burning heating system, which was recently started, is also a likely factor. Harbin's environmental bureau has also conducted checks on factories known to discharge pollutants, the China Daily report added. Extreme conditions Fang Lijuan, the city's chief meteorologist, said it was very rare for the city to suffer such extreme conditions. "There has been no strong wind and the level of humidity is high," she said, in quotes carried by China Daily. Residents of this city of 10 million people were also surprised by the thick smog. Living with an 'air-pocalypse' "The pollution is indeed very bad, we can only see things within 100 meters, and yesterday it was 20-30 meters. We can smell the smoke in the air," one man, who identified himself as Mr. Ren, told CNN. "The smog started about four days ago ... I heard all face masks in Harbin are sold out. People are very angry about this and there is a lot of discussion over the Internet.	1
In an attack orchestrated by a Pakistani Taliban commander, around 250 prisoners, most of them militants, were freed this week at the central prison in Dera Ismail Khan in northwestern Pakistan. The commander, Adnan Rashid, had been freed  two days before, after he was sentenced to death by a Pakistani court.Rashid is believed to be in command of a network of terrorists in the northwestern province of Peshawar, which has been home to some of the world's most dangerous terrorists in conflict with the US and Pakistan.Now, the Pakistan Army is said to be interrogating him. Officials say that, in addition to the charges he's already been found guilty of, he is also suspected of planning attacks against US and Israeli interests in Pakistan.The attack was carried out on Wednesday night when the prison authorities came into a cell, released around 250 detainees who had been held for a long time, and told one of them that they were free.In Pakistan, the militants have been released, in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in the case of the 2007 kidnapping and murder of five US consulate workers in the tribal agency of North Waziristan by the Haqqani Network.A report carried by the BBC shows that, in 2006 and 2007, the US said that an estimated 500 militants were held in an air base in North Waziristan by militants of the Haqqani Network. In 2006, then-President Pervez Musharraf said that he suspected that the militants were from the Haqqani Network.Pakistan has denied that the freed militants belonged to the Haqqani Network.The freed militants were said to be members of a Pakistani-based militant group called Lashkar-e-Taiba, or LeT, which was formed in the early 1990s. LeT is considered the main affiliate to the Pakistani Taliban.US and international security analysts have been saying for years that LeT was the main affiliate to the Taliban and a key factor in the rise to power of al-Qaeda and the other terrorist groups in the region. According to LeT, US and Indian intelligence services carried out a series of attacks in Kashmir between September and December 2001.According to the BBC, the freed militants were part of the group's military operations in Balochistan, Balochistan's main opium source.LeT officials told the BBC that the leader of the militants	0
Wednesday's decision by the U.S. Patent Office to repeal six federal trademarks of the Washington Redskins on the grounds that the name is "disparaging to Native Americans" is, of course, a victory  for the team's fans.And it's not just the Redskins who are cheering."Today's decision is great news for the fan base of the Washington Redskins and it's good for the game of professional football," said Tom Leahey, a spokesman for the team."This is just the latest chapter in a story that has, since its inception, been a battle against the suppression and stereotyping of Native Americans. Today's decision restores full protection to the Native American name."That's a reference to the Supreme Court case that helped open the doors of federal trademark protection to the Native-American phrase "Indian." The Court unanimously ruled in 1984 that the phrase was a generic term — one that wasn't disparaging to Native Americans.The Redskins have argued that Native Americans were being stereotyped by the name years before the Supreme Court ruling. The team has claimed that it only started to be known by the name Redskins after the Supreme Court ruling in 1982.The group that brought the case against the team, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said that in addition to the Supreme Court ruling, anti-Native-American groups have been working hard over the past 40 years to drive off and de-register Native-American names, such as "Lone Star," and to force Native-American sports teams to change their names.Those efforts stopped back in 1985, when the California Legislature passed a law banning the registration of "Indian-sounding" trademarks.But many Native-American trademarks have managed to escape the ban, and the fight against the team's name began anew in recent weeks.The U.S. Patent Office had until Tuesday to decide whether to revoke those six trademarks.After Tuesday's decision, two of the trademarks will be formally revoked, and the other four will be automatically revoked.So long as the team had a trademark on the name, it could have used it. That includes the one it uses for its official website.	0
Arizona investigators have released dramatic video of a Walmart parking lot brawl that left a police officer wounded, one man dead, and reportedly involved members of a Christian family iced in the back of a pickup truck. The attack happened Thursday morning at the store in Glendale, Arizona, near Phoenix. Witnesses said the suspect, 29-year-old John Wrobel Jr., was trying to stop shoppers from leaving the store. Witnesses say he was yelling profanity and throwing punches.Wal-Mart has said Wrobel didn’t come into the store, but it is investigating his claims that he was there and that he tried to stop customers. One of the witnesses said he was waiting to buy a phone and then saw a man walking toward him in a Walmart parking lot with a gun in one hand and a baseball bat in the other. That’s according to video of the incident, taken by another customer who was waiting in the store.The witnesses claim Wrobel was yelling profanity when he got right in front of the man with the gun. The witness then saw the man step back, and then heard two gunshots, according to the police report and a statement from Wal-Mart.According to a police report, the officer, later identified as Detective Jeffery Smith, was responding to a report of a suspicious male and was the first to arrive on scene.“Smith’s initial observations of the suspect led him to the conclusion that the suspect was attempting to buy a firearm,” police stated. “Once inside the store, Smith observed that the suspect’s behavior and mannerisms seemed suspicious so he asked the suspect to remove his hands from his pockets. Smith noticed the suspect put the firearm back into his pocket, and it later was determined the firearm was a stolen .38”Police did not say what type of gun allegedly was in Wrobel’s pocket. Sgt. Jim Goode told local reporters that Smith and the other officer who arrived at the scene were not involved in an incident with Wrobel, but Smith was injured and the other officer suffered a minor injury.Wal-Mart had no immediate comment on the video of the incident. The manager of the store, who was not named in a police report, told KPHO, “We’re taking it very seriously. We want to give all the facts. We hope to clear everything	0
After President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, a group organizing a fundraiser on his behalf suddenly had to find a bigger venue. The event, featuring the pop singer Pink, is one of two  upcoming events organized by Same Way Forward, a group that's trying to raise funds for an "advocacy fund" to help gays get married. Same Way Forward is organizing the concert and fundraiser in order to help push legislation in the U.S. Senate that would make it legal to marry same-sex couples.The group has been organizing fundraisers on behalf of several gay-rights groups, including the National Stonewall Democrats but this is the group's first "advocacy" effort.A group that wants to promote gay marriage in the U.S. held a rally on July 10 and an inaugural event on what day is marriage equality when is held in state legislatures on September 21, but they both came up short.If you're wondering about which U.S. state is ahead of Utah when it comes to marriage equality, check out this video to see how your vote made an impact:The following are excerpts from a news story written by Robert D. Rosenstone in The Los Angeles Times on Saturday, June 13, 2014. Thanks to his efforts, the same-sex marriage bill in Hawaii will become law on September 21.It was a stunning demonstration of the power of passion and principle at the California Capitol on Saturday, as hundreds of opponents of same-sex marriage rallied to save the marriage bill by a vote of 40 to 6. But the victory was hard-fought, a grudging compromise that drew support from both sides on most major issues.The victory was a blow to anti-gay forces, who had been trying for months to bring the bill to a vote by making an issue out of same-sex marriage, using religious objections or other tactics that included the governor and state legislators.For weeks, opponents of same-sex marriage have been rallying at the state Capitol in Sacramento to protest the state's law that allows civil unions for same-sex couples. Protesters staged a series of rallies and protests in October and January, but officials had made clear that they were not going to change the law because of them.In January, the state Senate approved the civil unions law by a 20-6 vote, but it failed to reach the Assembly floor for a vote in February	0
With South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford dominating the news, let's look back at a five other so-called virtuous figures who became embroiled in sex scandals -- and this list just scratches the surface. Jim Bakker admitted to cheating on his  wife Tammy Faye Bakker. 1. Aimee Semple McPherson By the mid-1920s, evangelist McPherson was packing them in at her Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, preaching hope and warning against the sinful life. But in 1926, she disappeared while swimming at a local beach. She turned up a month later with a fantastic story about being kidnapped and taken to Mexico. Unfortunately, the evidence said otherwise: It appeared Aimee had been shacked up with a married man. The evangelist was charged with perjury, but she stuck to her story and was eventually acquitted. Her popularity waned after the scandal, but you gotta hand it to her for chutzpah: instead of apologizing to her confused flock, McPherson bobbed her hair, bought some short skirts, and began dancing and drinking in public. 2. Jim Bakker Simple people with a simple dream, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker started out hosting a children's religious puppet show. By the mid-1970s, however, the fabulous Bakker duo had become the toast of televangelism. They pulled in millions of dollars in contributions to their PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry, and even built a sort of fundamentalist Disneyland called Heritage USA in South Carolina. Mental Floss: Proposing the presidential way But Jim had a couple of dirty little secrets. He had paid a former church secretary named Jessica Hahn to keep quiet about a sexual encounter they had in 1980. But when the scandal broke in 1987, questions began to be raised about Bakker's financial dealings. In 1989, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison for fleecing his flock of $158 million. In the end he only served five, and moved forward with his life, eventually opening a new ministry in a restaurant in Branson, Missouri. Mental Floss: 10 great love affairs in history 3. Jimmy Swaggart Swaggart was one of Jim Bakker's fiercest critics when the Bakker scandal broke, telling an interviewer he himself had never even kissed a woman other than his wife.	1
Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday. It will take several  years to review all of these hours, and they might never be done altogether.This is the Air France flight 447 story.For a better understanding of how this crash happened, I started from the first plane that arrived from Canada in Toronto. Air Canada sent a jet in for a last-minute, emergency landing so the plane from the original flight (from Paris) could pick up the second plane that was to land in Montreal. That happened on Thursday, Jan. 14. They were still in Toronto by then, which meant the emergency landing could not be until Sunday, which also meant that the original takeoff would have to be on a Wednesday. So the Canadian government had to scramble to get two new airplanes. Then Air Canada sent them both to Paris.The Air Force had put out a media release announcing that the plane had been hijacked, and on Saturday, Jan. 18 a French official confirmed that the plane had been hijacked. Two days later, Friday, Jan. 22, officials in Paris confirmed there was a hijacking. And on Monday, Jan. 25, the French announced that the plane had been shot down by a missile. This meant that Air France had to go to a new airport for their next flight. That got them into Toronto, about a week later, on Jan. 28.But wait, I hear you say. So how could the terrorists have pulled this off? Air France Flight 447 came in from Paris at about 7:30 a.m., on Thursday morning, and headed to Toronto. Had the terrorists changed the plane's destination after the flight control tower had changed its position to let them in? Why was the Air France plane in Toronto? And so on.You should probably understand what these questions mean, because we'll be talking about them for the next four days. So let me say a word or two about what happened.The passengers of Air France Flight 447 were mostly Middle Easterners. As with any international flight, some of them were terrorists and some of them were not. The hijackers on Flight 447 were Saudis; the people who sent that plane on a hijacking mission were Iraqis; the people who took over control of the plane had Libyan citizenship. The	0
President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced several key appointments to his communications team Saturday. Robert Gibbs will have one of the most highly visible roles in the Obama administration. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also ixitined for the position, will serve as the President-elect's press secretary."A lot of it is the transition, and there are a lot of moving parts and a lot of things that are still moving in a very fluid and intense way," Gibbs told BuzzFeed. "So my role is really to be a sounding board. I'll do what I can to help and advise the President-elect along his journey as he goes about making that transition."Gibbs is the second top Obama campaign spokesman to be appointed during the transition, following Rick Davis as deputy campaign manager.Gibbs, 53, served as a spokesperson for President-elect Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential race and was a spokesman for President George W. Bush until the end of his term in 2007, during which he wrote a book called "The Politics of Hope and Change.""I was really excited about this, and I was really excited about this opportunity, because I think it's a huge opportunity," Gibbs said. "The President-elect and the White House have been engaged with all the candidates for the past year and a half. Everybody has sort of played by the rules and sort of played by the old set of rules. And this is the first time you have a truly free and open campaign."Gibbs's transition team includes a number of longtime Obama surrogates, including campaign manager David Plouffe; senior adviser David Axelrod; senior policy adviser Jim Messina and senior chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.The press secretary also will have the task of keeping reporters apprised of White House developments.Gibbs will be reporting to White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, with whom he's worked since 1993."I will be working closely with Rahm," Gibbs said.

A Cleveland man was indicted Thursday in the killings of two women, cases that were resurrected after the discovery of three women held captive for years by Ariel ÂÂ³.An FBI affidavit says Ariel "had already threatened or committed acts of physical violence against his victims" at the time of his capture and that the victim in this case, Ariel's cousin, was killed for her testimony. The affidavit says Ariel killed the two women for their money and because of the fact that at least one had a tattoo of an animal.According to court documents, Ariel's cousin worked at a local fast food restaurant owned by the same man. She says she worked there for nearly two weeks.The woman said she was sexually assaulted and assaulted with a knife.The documents say the restaurant where the victims worked was closed when they were killed.The documents say Ariel confessed to the killings and led investigators to the bodies, which he then burned.The documents say he was arrested by the police after a man came forward with information about Ariel and the bodies.The woman said she feared for her life and had no way of securing a gun at the time of the killings.The court documents say Ariel's alleged victims were shot to death.The affidavit says Ariel had sex with a 16-year-old girl and told her he was going to kill her. They had consensual sex and then he moved her into another room.The affidavit says he told her he was going to kill her when she was alone in the room. She said he then took her hand and put it on his penis.The documents say that in the same statement, he said he was going to kill the girl because she was not the one that he wanted to have sex with.He told the girl to get on her knees because they were going to have sex.Later, he said he had sex with the girl because she was his first partner and he did not want to be unfaithful.Ariel also allegedly told this victim to "take a dump in front of him" and "put out his penis in front of her." He then said he told her he was going to watch her put it out but she told him she wouldn't do it and then he said he walked around the corner and he shot her.The documents say he has no record of psychiatric treatment in the	0
After a prolonged courtship with Seattle, the Sacramento Kings are officially staying put. About two weeks after rejecting a sales bid that would have had the team moving 750 miles north to Washington state, the NBA board of   fate has made its own decision.The Kings, who had played at Sleep Train Arena since 1995-96, and were one of the most successful franchises in sports, are leaving the city. They won the first NBA title in 1995-96, and have won 17 playoff series in two decades. As the league looks to expand, Sacramento is now in the crosshairs of two franchises that could, in theory, go on to win more basketball games than it ever has in its history.If the Kings are going, so are the San Antonio Spurs. They are also looking for a new city, and a new place to play. The NBA announced on Wednesday that it reached a final agreement with San Antonio that would allow the Spurs to play their inaugural season in the downtown area.The league is asking the Spurs to build a 60,000-seat arena just blocks away from their current home. With more than 1.5 million people expected to visit the Spurs' new arena, San Antonio would become the first team in league history to reach that many. The league is now calling its new downtown location the AT&T Center, referring to the team's sponsor as its major partner."They are the reigning champions," Spurs chairman Pat Riley said. "They have an arena that fits and they've got great ownership. So, you know, the decision to stay here and build a new arena is not an easy one."The Spurs, who have lost only three games in eight years in San Antonio, had long been rumored to be looking to move. At least three other cities, with varying histories, have been mentioned in the past few months, sources said.The Spurs offered one of those cities — Sacramento — to the Kings last summer, but a Sacramento-based company that brokered the sales deal pulled out of negotiations after a failed attempt to secure a higher-priced stadium deal for $160 million. In the end, the Spurs were willing to pay just $65 million, sources said.The Kings' departure also leaves the league without a permanent home court. They were in their current home, Sleep Train Arena, through the 1995-96 season, playing at the arena for part of	0

More than 150 soldiers in Bangladesh were sentenced to death Tuesday for murder, rape and arson during a 2009 mutiny. "The convicts will be hanged by the neck until death," ruled Mohammad Akhteruzzaman, a senior judge at the Dhaka  court. The sentence was the third this year for atrocities committed in the revolt.Maj. Gen. Asaduzzaman has also been charged in connection with the mutiny, but the trial is scheduled to start March. It's not uncommon for military rulers to have the death sentence reviewed.The verdict could have implications for future military rulers after current Gen. Mahmud Ali.Dhaka, Bangladesh -- More than 200 soldiers in Bangladesh were sentenced Tuesday to death for mutiny and rape and in connection with a 2009 riot that ended in death, arson and destruction of public and private buildings.Maj. Gen. Asaduzzaman has also been charged in connection with the mutiny, but the trial is scheduled to start March. It's not uncommon for military rulers to have the death sentence reviewed.The verdict could have implications for future military rulers after current Gen. Mahmud Ali."This has come as a shock to me," said Maj. Gen. Mahbub Uddin Chowdhury, the defense minister.Chowdhury said that the government plans to free two dozen of the soldiers who were convicted Tuesday. The government has also begun a new inquiry.The Bangladeshi government is holding those convicted in connection with the 2009 riot accountable, and will try them in their civilian court in a hearing starting March 9."There is always the chance to review the verdict," said Shahidul Haque, director of Human Rights Commission of India. "The government can go in for an appeal."Bangladesh's military rulers have a history of executing soldiers sentenced to death.Maj. Gen. Asaduzzaman was sentenced to death in 2011 for allegedly killing a guard in an army jail and assaulting his colleague at a military check point, according to the Bangladesh Army, which said Asaduzzaman was found guilty in a summary court and sentenced to death.Maj. Gen. Muzammel Haque, a senior police official, was also sentenced to death last year after he was found guilty of "crimes against humanity" during a riot that left 22 people dead and	0
A militant Islamist group claimed responsibility Monday for bombings the day before that the Nigerian Red Cross said left 50 people dead at three Christian churches in Nigeria. Boko Haram said the attacks Sunday in the Nigerian cities of Zaria and Kaduna were retaliation on Christians for destroying mosques and, according to the group, turning others into "beer parlour and prostitution joints." "Let them know that now it's the time for revenge God willing," the group said in a statement. "From now on, they either follow the right religion or there will be no peace for them." Government and Red Cross figures on the death toll in Sunday's attacks differed. However, the bombings at two churches and a third in Kaduna left at least 50 people dead and 131 wounded according to the Red Cross. Kaduna state officials loosened a 24-hour curfew imposed after the attacks, saying people could be on the streets from 2 to 6 p.m. However, resident Anthony Majindadi said most people were staying indoors and his area still looked like a ghost town. The series of attacks began when a suicide bomber drove at high speed through a barricade at the EWCA Goodnews Wusasa Zaria church around 9 a.m., congregation member Lucy Bello said. A Kaduna state official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that blast killed at least 24 people and injured 125. The Nigerian Red Cross Society, however, reported that two people died and 22 were injured in the attack. Within minutes, another explosion occurred at the Christ the King Catholic Church in Zaria, according to Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency. At least 10 people died and more than 50 were injured in that attack, the state government official said. Again, the Nigerian Red Cross Society offered a conflicting report, saying 16 people died and 31 were injured in the attack. Later, at least 10 people died in a bombing at a church in the city of Kaduna, Red Cross spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo said. The Red Cross said 32 people died and 78 were injured in the third blast and ensuing reprisal attacks by Christians on Muslims. Christian youths in Zaria and Kaduna burned mosques and property belonging to Muslims, according to the Vanguard newspaper in Nigeria. Military forces patrolled the streets Sunday in an effort to control retaliatory violence, the Vanguard reported.	1
Brothers Thomas and Raymond Kwok, who control Hong Kong's biggest property development company, Sun Hung Kai, have been arrested for suspected corruption, authorities said Thursday. Also arrested for suspected corruption was a person described by Hong Kong's Department of Justice as "a former principal official of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," a spokesman for the Independent Commission Against Corruption said. The Kwok brothers' fortune is $18.3 billion, according to Forbes Magazine, which rank the brothers and their family as the 27th richest in the world. The commission's report said "the arrested persons are alleged to have committed offenses under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and misconduct in public office." The arrests come 10 days after Sun Hung Kai's executive director, Thomas Chan, was arrested by the commission in connection with a bribery investigation. Four other people, whose backgrounds weren't disclosed by authorities, were also arrested on corruption charges. On Thursday morning, Sun Hung Kai Properties suspended trading of its shares. The company has since announced the shares will resume trading when Hong Kong's stock exchange opens Friday morning. The firm has set up a special committee to handle all matters arising from the investigation, and the company's board, whose six members include the two brothers, has resolved that the Kwoks will "continue to undertake and discharge their duties to the group, including their duties as joint chairmen and managing directors of the company," according to a company statement. CNN's Andrew Henstock contributed from Hong Kong and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles.	1
Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone. Construction of the inaugural stand continues in front of the White House last week. President Bush raised a record $42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of the donations to that ceremony were from executives or corporations. But this year, some say throwing a multimillion-dollar party would be unseemly in a time when crash, bailout, and foreclosure fill the economic headlines. "A lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top, that they don't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now," said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The inaugural committee for Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make sure the ceremony underscores the incoming administration's "commitment to change business as usual in Washington." The Presidential Inaugural Committee has limited individual contributions to $50,000. There is no law restricting the size of donations, but in the past, inaugural committees  have set contribution limits as high as $250,000. The PIC said it will not take contributions from corporations, political action committees, current federally registered lobbyists, non-U.S. citizens or registered foreign agents. Obama has promised to "take power away from the corporate lobbyists" -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president-elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill. "If he can pay for these parties with small donations, I think there'd be a lot more acceptance of that," Alexander said. Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone. For example, he could make donations to charity, and Michelle Obama could opt for something more reasonably priced than a designer dress. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, he also faced a financial crisis. He gave voters a now famous pep talk about the failing economy, then skipped the fancy inaugural balls because they sent the wrong message. But analysts say Obama's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win.	1
German leaders are furious with Greece. Yet again they have to go back to their electorates asking for more billions to throw down the black hole that is the Hellenic Republic. They have now become so angry that they are even openly proposing  to close the Greek government. And they are doing it in the hope that their citizens will go out and vote for a left-wing government in the next election. They are so angry that they are even threatening to suspend the Euro.Germany's anger could have something to do with Greek's being called "the sick man of Europe" in the last few days. He is being talked about in the same breath as Mussolini and Hitler while being compared to the current leader of China.The Greeks are sick as hell and deserve to be treated like sick people while at the same time being told that all the blame and no blame is to be placed on them because they are sick and need help just like a person who is blind need to get help.And they have just now started getting a little better.They have just begun to get the attention they deserve as all of Europe becomes more and more aware of their illness and the need to help them. The Greeks are the sickest members of the European Union and if someone doesn't help them right now, then they will be heading for disaster.And when it is all said and done, that is exactly what is going to happen because the Europeans will become more aware of their illness and need more help.Greece will become sicker than the rest of Europe because the Greeks are the sickest in Europe.But what does it really matter to the Europeans if Greece does become sick or not and if they do get help. They can all sit around and let China's sick people die.What I find so interesting about the EU and the EU's sickness is that they are sick and yet they have no idea they are sick. But they do know that Greece is sick. And they have been trying to come up with the right solution, the only solution that makes any sense, which means admitting that they are sick is the only solution.There are many sick European nations that never needed to be admitted to be sick because they never had to suffer the indignity that comes with being the sick members of the European Union.Europe has become like a sick person and they can just sit around and wait for the	0

Much has been said about Kim Kardashian in the weeks leading up to her wedding, and now the reality star is speaking for herself. The 33-year-old opened up Wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to iced lattes.Kardashian showed off her dress on Instagram, which was $7,800, and confirmed the story: The dress, which was given to her by her designer, Rag & Bone, was designed from a photo shoot of Kim in the lingerie. Kardashian wore it to her engagement bash at the Four Seasons on Saturday.“I am so thrilled to be starting my life with my best friend, Kanye West, and my new husband, Kris Humphries,” Kardashian wrote when sharing the post. “Thank you guys for the support over the last year! I couldn’t have gotten to this point without you.” (In 2014, Kardashian married Kanye West and became a global cultural phenomenon.) In a video posted over the weekend, Kardashian walked down the aisle with Humphries, her fiancé since May 2016. They both wore white satin gowns with tulle and lace.Kardashian’s Instagram post also addressed the truth about the wedding dress. The supermodel wore the dress from her bridesmaids’ dresses for the wedding, and the truth is: Yes, she did wear a wedding dress. The dresses were part of her bridal party, as the bride of the groom.“Thank you to the women of my bridesmaids’ dresses,” Kardashian wrote. “It was their idea and I couldn’t feel more grateful.”The reality TV star, who is now a mom to North, followed up with some more details on the dress she wore. She said she spent about three months searching for a dress and had the top, skirt and gloves made by her friend, who designed hers.“It’s so special and I am so grateful,” she wrote.She also opened up about her iced lattes. “I drank a lot of lattes,” Kardashian said.Kardashian and Humphries, who have been together since March 2016, are about to tie the knot soon. In an Instagram post, Kardashian said she is excited and nervous.“I�	0
The late Kemal Amin "Casey" Kasem was much more than a relic of radio's Top 40 heyday. In this era of streaming and downloading, when everyone functions as his or her own DJ and program director, the "tastemaking" role of music radio in the late 20th century -- the role that Kasem pretty much owned -- is almost impossible to fathom. Casey Kasem was neither a maverick like pioneer rock & roll disc jockey Alan Freed nor a budding multimedia entrepreneur like Dick Clark. He didn't strive to be hip or hustle after the cutting edge. He wasn't really a gatekeeper or curator. His on-air presence was neutral; he merely was a conduit for whatever records were most popular. Each week he'd present the top singles as reported on the Billboard charts, framing the songs with homespun advice, listener dedications and decidedly noncontroversial anecdotes about the performers. From 1970 to 1988, his syndicated weekly program, "America's Top 40," documented the ever-shifting mainstream of musical tastes. By today's standards, it can sound overly cautious or conservative, but it also reflected a cultural consensus that barely exists anymore. Kasem's long-distance dedications Easily accessible and free of charge, "America's Top 40" was a gateway drug for a generation or two of budding music fanatics. Kasem was the patron saint of preteen pop devotees held captive to their parents' car radios. His data-dependent chart format made him an enabler for amateur statisticians and precocious list-compilers, kids who couldn't afford subscriptions to the trade magazines. The sturdy scaffolding under Kasem's success was his voice: upbeat, naturally modulated, soothing without being smarmy. Hear him once and he became Casey: familiar, somehow. You could accuse him of being corny, a shameless Pez dispenser of sentimental patter and clichÃ©d advice along with pablum pop. You'd be literally correct but also fundamentally clueless about his down-to-earth appeal. Kasem managed to be commercial without coming across like a hyped-up huckster. He made it seem easy, and also seamless, for instance segueing from a convoluted factoid about Top 10 hits with the word "Doctor" in the title to a Dr. Pepper spot.	1
When Elon Musk released details of the Hyperloop -- a transportation system concept that could take people back and forth between San Francisco and Los Angeles at near sonic speeds in about 30 minutes -- he added, "feedback would be most welcome." Musk already has the input of 1000 engineers from SpaceX and Tesla. So why would he need additional pointers? Why did he invite the world to chime in? Historically, the planning and design of mass transit systems involved a team of experienced professionals working exclusively with those from other key stakeholder groups. The process may easily take up a decade before the final design is ready for approval. But just as today's open source product designs on the Web have benefited and improved from the collective effort of programmers, so has Musk decided to confront the design bottleneck by opening up the design process to the general public -- anyone and everyone who cares. The Hyperloop is a $6 billion public infrastructure project that is as challenging as it is ambitious. Opinion: Hyperloop could be a reality The future of transportation may well lie in the hybridization of multiple technologies. The alpha version of the Hyperloop design published by Musk on Monday seems like a carefully engineered "lego" transit system with capsules supported on air bearings, the main tube placed on pylons and covered with solar arrays, and advanced propulsion systems. These components have been or can be individually designed, and made to work as per specification under normal conditions. The difficult part is to make the system safe and efficient while accounting for all the possible contingency events that may arise. The distance that separates any two adjacent capsules, called the headway, is a critical design parameter, and it will need to account for additional speed changes and halts that may occur during real operating conditions. Smaller headways will require a capsule-to-capsule signaling system. If multiple stations are envisioned, sophisticated interlocking systems must be designed. These signaling and control systems open up a Pandora's box of safety and security concerns. What if a computer hacker is able to bypass the signaling system? What if an attacker causes a severe collision by exploiting vulnerabilities of the electronics and communications equipment? The Hyperloop design will require built-in security and safety systems to address these scenarios.	1
Newcastle wasn't the opposition but there was another seven-goal classic at Anfield. Jordan Henderson scored deep in the second half to give Liverpool a 4-3 win over Swansea City, rekindling memories of the Reds' victories over Newcastle by the same score in 1996 and 1997. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wasn't afraid to say this month that his men were title contenders and with the offense flowing, his team trails Chelsea by a mere four points atop the standings. Daniel Sturridge -- second behind only teammate Luis Suarez in league scoring -- netted for an eighth straight Premier League outing to close in on Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of 10. "It was an important win for us," Rodgers told Sky Sports. "We certainly weren't at our best today but the offensive part of our game, which is very strong, came out on top again. "It's an outstanding result for us and the game typified the character of this team." Liverpool looked set to cruise when Henderson and Sturridge gave Liverpool a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes. But Swansea, under newish boss Garry Monk, didn't cave in. Jonjo Shelvey began a comeback against his former club and Wilfried Bony made it 2-2 in the 27th minute. After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound. A rejuvenated Henderson has been another bright spot for Rodgers this season but the defense is a worry. Defender Martin Skrtel particularly struggled Sunday, giving away the penalty when he clashed with Bony. Liverpool has conceded 35 goals, the most of any team in the top seven. "As always as a coach, you'll analyze where you can be better, and we're looking to improve (on defense) for next week," said Rodgers. The top four all won this weekend but fifth-place Tottenham suffered a blow in its chase for a Champions League spot, losing 1-0 at relegation threatened Norwich City. Loic Remy scored in second-half injury time to give Newcastle a 1-0 win against Aston Villa at home, leaving Villa, like Norwich, four points above the relegation zone.	1
Amidst all the shouting over Tuesday's transfer of the House of Representatives to Republican control, a distinct cry of pain could be heard for the loss of one voice -- Representative Rick Boucher (D-VA). Republican Morgan Griffith, majority leader of  House Republicans, called Boucher Monday night after the House voted on a resolution condemning and rejecting the decision of Republicans to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) with fellow Democrat Steny Hoyer (D-MD) as Democrats' leader. "The entire Republican leadership is deeply disappointed that we lost our majority," Griffith said in a statement.In an op-ed piece in The Virginian-Pilot, Boucher says he, too, was surprised. But it wasn't because Republicans had lost the House. It wasn't because of the partisan fights the House Republicans had been having (or, in a certain sense, winning), one after another. It was for the simple reason that Boucher, who's on leave from the House as he takes exams to become a doctor, had to drop out of the Virginia Senate race.So as far as I understand, Boucher resigned before the election in order to go campaign for his U.S. Senate seat and run for lieutenant governor in Virginia. I would assume he would be the Republican candidate in that race but I would be very surprised if he ran against any other Democrat. He has a great name and a good record as a pro-life conservative on many issues. He has run for office consistently.This was Boucher's plan all along. I'm fairly convinced he would have done it had Pelosi been replaced with someone more like Hoyer.This was Boucher's plan all along. I'm fairly convinced he would have done it had Pelosi been replaced with someone more like Hoyer. Just thought I'd share his reasoning.I think the first reason is related to his public profile. He's been known as a good guy. He's worked in the VA Senate and was very pro-life on several issues.Next, he doesn't like being in the minority (or the majority) and so doesn't want to face the risk and stress of being the swing vote.Finally, he doesn't like having to do things he doesn't want to do (and I assume that's what the Republicans wanted him to do).I would be surprised if he'll run for Senate, though, and	0
There are moments when "Move Like This," the first new album by the Cars in 24 years, sounds so much like a record by the Cars that you find yourself laughing out loud. Take "Sad Song," on  "Tunnel Vision" (from the same album), which is not only the song featuring that signature Cars' falsetto, but also the one that contains one of the most perfect, almost nursery-rhyme-like lines ever from the group: "Just walk and turn left/Just walk and turn left/Just walk and turn left."That song, and others like it, sound so much like the first Cars album that it's almost impossible to avoid the feeling that this is a Cars album, with the Cars singing the same songs as on their first album and the guitars providing the same electric sound as on the first album, albeit in a different key. (Though perhaps the first album had heavier guitars and deeper bass.) Some of the songs sound similar enough to the Cars' debut album that you'll wonder if this is a repackaged album with the same title on it, but the Cars are so far from being a retro band that there's no chance they'll ever make a repackaged Cars album. And, actually, the Cars and the Cars are so different from each other that it's pretty hard to believe one album came from the other."Move Like This" is the first Cars album to have been written from start to finish by the Cars themselves, since their 1977 self-titled debut, and if the Cars, who've never sounded better than they do on those two albums, have never recorded anywhere near as good a bunch of songs as they have on their first, it's because their sound wasn't quite finished. It was pretty clear early on that the Cars were trying to put together a cohesive whole, and that's what they've been trying to do on songs like "Sad Song" and "My Hero," and to a lesser extent on the songs they chose to include on "Move Like This." But when they finally did finish a collection of songs that fit together, and the Cars, especially Peter Frampton, brought that whole package up to where it was on their first album, by then they'd gone off the tracks. "Move Like This," then, isn't just an album that's been put together by the Cars, it's the Cars themselves putting together a whole new album.	0
Late on the night of last September 11, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. "Greg, we're under attack," Stevens told Gregory Hicks. Within hours, Stevens and three other Americans were dead, victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in Washington's partisan wars. The dramatic narrative recounted by Hicks at a six-hour Republican-led House hearing on Wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high-level insider who was in Libya that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events. His efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern Libya were later praised by his superiors and by President Barack Obama. The step-by-step account riveted the Oversight Committee proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack. What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack Republicans once again accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well-orchestrated assault by militants, failing to adequately explain events to the public, and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators. Democrats once again accused Republicans of using tragedy for political gain. Hicks -- praised by Republicans as a "whistleblower" but who says he has since been effectively demoted -- was joined at the witness table by Eric Nordstrom, a former regional security officer in Libya, and Mark Thompson, the State Department's acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism. Our goal "is to get answers, declared committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California.  "The administration, however, has not been cooperative." Hicks described in personal detail how he missed Stevens' initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases. "I got the ambassador on the other end and he said, 'Greg, we're under attack.'" He recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers, and "repeated attempts" by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue Stevens and others. He then said that Stevens was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said Twitter feeds identified as leading the attack. Was it a trap to lure more Americans? Then the worst news about his boss.	1
and Apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works. Since Apple's new smartphone was released just over a week ago, some of the millions of users have reported that, when a strong source of light is not available, or the flash is not on, or the light is behind awall or the subject is too far away for the camera, the camera does not take a picture. The issue was flagged to Apple Support but the response has been that they've investigated the issue and there is no fix for it. This is unacceptable, and it's definitely a bug that should be fixed immediately. The iPhone 7 Plus will be released on Thursday and, judging by Apple's reaction to the issue, it seems that this is being addressed in its final form.

Two weeks ago, Google published its much-anticipated Gmail app in the Apple app store. It didn't work. So the company had to yank the app. And now it's back again. On Wednesday the Mountain View, California, company said it had "fixed the bug and notifications are now working, and the app is back in the App Store." Google offered no new apology for the screw-up, and said the app would continue to improve: "We're just getting started with the Gmail app for iOS and will be iterating rapidly to bring you more features, including all the ones listed above plus many more," Matthew Izatt, a product manager, wrote on Google's Gmail blog. "Based on your comments we have already improved our handling of image HTML messages - they are now sized to fit to the screen and you can pinch to zoom in. " The company added: "In the short time the app was public we received a lot of helpful feedback and feature requests." On November 2, the company offered an apology to users, who complained the app didn't work. "The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications," the company wrote on Twitter. "We have pulled the app to fix the problem. Sorry we messed up." The whole ordeal led at least one tech writer to lose his faith in the company's innovative potential. "They release something, and I no longer have any faith that it's going to be any good," MG Siegler wrote on his personal Tumblr blog. "It's hard to get excited about a company like that. It's the same reason why it's hard to get excited when Microsoft and Yahoo release new things. The track record just isn't there any more. The faith is gone." At least some initial feedback about the re-released app was positive. "I really like it, the UI is great - don't know what all these people are complaining about," one person wrote on the app's page in iTunes Preview. Overall, the app had a three-of-five-star rating on that page.	1
After a prolonged courtship with Seattle, the Sacramento Kings are officially staying put. About two weeks after rejecting a sales bid that would have had the team moving 750 miles north to Washington state, the NBA board of governors on Tuesday approved the Kings' sale to a local ownership group helmed by Vivek Ranadive. The vote was unanimous, the NBA said in a news release, and "the transaction is expected to close shortly." Terms of the deal were not released. "Thanks to entire NBA for approving sale of Kings to our organization," tweeted Ranadive, the founder and CEO of TIBCO Software in Palo Alto, California. "It is an honor & a privilege to be part of such an amazing community." The Maloof family -- known for ownership of properties in Las Vegas, such as the Palms, among other business ventures -- has been trying for months to unload its majority owner stakes in the pro basketball franchise. The family members have on multiple occasions reached apparent deals to sell the team to a Seattle-based group, including investor Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, only to be rebuffed by other NBA executives. In January, these two parties reached a deal for that group to buy the Maloofs' 53% share of the team as well as minority owner Bob Hernreich's 12% stake. But the board of governors never signed off. The Maloof family and Hansen's group, though, kept on talking, leading to another deal for a higher price and a vote earlier this month by the NBA board. Public officials in Sacramento, meanwhile, never gave up on their efforts to keep the team. Led by Mayor Kevin Johnson, who is a former all-star NBA guard, they worked on a stadium plan and collaborated with a group led by Ranadive that was intent on keeping the team in northern California. On May 15, the 22 members of the league's board of governors rejected the Kings' relocation bid, while eight voted in favor. After that vote, Commissioner David Stern cited the existence of a "strong ownership group," a construction team and a plan for a new arena, plus strong support from officials and residents in the Sacramento area. Johnson celebrated that day, and again on Tuesday. Congrats to @Vivek & the new ownership group!" the mayor wrote on Twitter. "NBA's unanimous vote sends a strong statement of support for the Kings' bright future in Sac!"	1
As the rappellers on the Washington Monument check for cracks in the structure's exterior, they won't be able to see themselves in another Washington landmark: the Reflecting Pool below. It's currently a giant mud pit. The pool where tourists have been able to see majestic reflections of both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial has been under construction since last November to address problems with leaking and to make the water cleaner with a new circulation system. Although it currently looks like a mess, Steve Lorenzetti with the National Park Service sees it differently. "I describe it as almost done with the infrastructure necessary for us to finish this project," he said. The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool project is expected to be complete in the spring of 2012. When finished, the pool will actually have about a third less water than previously and will be shallower. According to Lorenzetti, the general public won't be able to tell. "The reflective quality of this pool is of paramount importance to us," he said. "So what you will see if there is no wind is a flat, glassy surface." The Reflecting Pool is just one part of the aging National Mall that has problems, according to Caroline Cunningham, president of the Trust for the National Mall. She pointed out to reporters Tuesday other mall sites that have been neglected in recent years, including the area called Union Square up near the Capitol. "Right now, there's this beautiful reflecting pool. But, can we make it a place where people can come cool off in the summertime?" she said, referring to another, smaller reflecting pool near the Capitol. She describes the National Mall as needing help, saying it needs to be more amenable for visitors. The Trust for the National Mall is currently running a design contest to come up with a sustainable, creative solution to problems at Union Square. "It should be one of the most beautiful spaces on the National Mall and it has not really been touched since the 1970s when it was built," she said.	1
A near all-black Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner has been delivered to launch customer Air New Zealand, giving Boeing fans and aviation nerds a dramatic introduction to this latest model of the fuel-efficient plane. The head-turning aircraft, sporting a special edition, mostly black livery, was handed over to the carrier in Everett, Washington, with around 1,000 Boeing employees and Air New Zealand executives attending. "It's a big night for us all, seeing the plane come out of the hangar here," said Air New Zealand captain David Morgan. "I'm very excited to be able to get my hands on this aircraft and proudly fly it back to New Zealand." Newer = bigger The 787-9 is 20 feet longer than its predecessor, the 787-8, and can hold 40 more passengers. It also has a greater range of 8,000-8,500 nautical miles, compared to the 787-8's range of 7,650-8,200. "Obviously with their geography they're the perfect airline to really exercise this airplane -- they'll really be able to use the amazing performance that the 787-9 has," said Boeing's Mark Jenks, vice president, 787 Airplane Development. The manufacturer said it was on track to deliver 10 of the new planes to Air New Zealand by mid-year. Twenty-six customers have ordered 409 787-9s to date, accounting for 40% of all 787 orders. Due to a lighter, composite body, the plane can operate on 20% less fuel than other similar sized planes and offers design features such as larger, dimmable windows and in-cabin LED lighting. Flight routes Air New Zealand will begin operating its 787-9 in October 2014, flying from Auckland to Perth, Australia. In November it'll begin flights from Auckland to Tokyo and Shanghai. The launch aircraft will offer 302 seats total, with the business premier cabin housing 18 lie-flat seats, a premium economy cabin with 21 seats and two economy cabins with 263 seats total. The plane will also have 14 Skycouch rows -- a design unique to the Kiwi airline that turns a row of three economy seats into a three-seater "couch." The plane will arrive in Auckland this Friday, July 11. Frances Cha contributed to this story.	1
South African mountain bike star Burry Stander, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the London Olympics, has been killed in a road accident. Stander, 25, was on a training ride when he was hit Thursday by a vehicle in Shelly Beach, on the country's southeast coast, according to Cycling South Africa, the national cycling body. Details of the accident are still being investigated, it said. "Not only is this a loss to South African sport, but we have lost a true gentleman who through his professionalism, modesty and humility, constantly showing sheer guts, represented our country with great pride," Cycling South Africa said in the statement released Thursday. The organization expressed its condolences to Stander's family, including his wife and parents. Stander finished fifth in the Men's Cross Country mountain bike event at the Olympic Games in London last year. It was the second Olympics for Stander, who had finished 15th in the same event at the Beijing Games. He rode a superb race to move through the field in a race won by Jaroslav Kulhavy of the Czech Republic from Nino Schurter of Switzerland. Italy's Marco Fontana was third, 25 seconds adrift, with Stander only missing out on the podium by four seconds in a close finish. He had won the 2011 African championships to book his place at the Games. Adrien Niyonshuti was fourth in the same race to become the first Rwandan to qualify for an Olympic competition. Stander had recently married the multiple South African road race champion Cherise Taylor. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.	1
Michelle Wie clung on to a share of the lead at the U.S. Women's Open Saturday as the former teenage prodigy bids for her first major title after a series of near misses. Wie shot a two-over 72 on the testing Pinehurst No.2 course, which was used for the men's U.S. Open won by Martin Kaymer last week. It left her on two-under 208 to be joined by South Korea's Amy Yang, who posted a third round two-under 68 with six birdies. "I was hitting the ball really solid today, and I had good speed on the greens," Yang said. "I had a great round today." Wie, now 24, has twice led her national open going into the final round, in 2005 and 2006, but finished tied for 23rd and tied third respectively. In fine form in 2014, Wie finished second in the opening major of the season, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, and won the LPGA Lotte Championship in April. She led after two opening rounds of 68, but admitted she had to "grind it out" during her third round. Asked about her prospects of victory Sunday, Wie remained non-committal. "I'm just grateful to have another opportunity," she told Sky Sports. "I'm going to play as well as I can and hope for the best." Wie might have held a one-shot lead but missed a 10-foot birdie putt on the final green, the sort of chances which were being holed on the first two days. In a tournament which was dominated at the start by the astonishing feat of 11-year-old Lucy Li in qualifying for the championship, 53-year-old Juli Inkster struck a blow for the diminishing band of veteran players on the LPGA Tour. American Inkster carded a best of the day 66 to join the group tied for third on two-over, which also included Australian amateur Minjee Lee, South Korean Choi Na-Yeon and Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow. Inkster, playing her 35th U.S. Open, has won seven majors and is set to retire at the end of the season.	1
A British parliamentary report slammed Barclays bank on Saturday for its "disgraceful" actions that led to a rate-rigging scandal. The Treasury Select Committee issued a report after recent hearings over the scandal. Barclays was fined $450  million for rigging Libor interest rates in the U.K. and announced it would set up an independent monitoring unit to "ensure that such practices do not happen again." Barclays' chairman Marcus Agius resigned over the scandal on Thursday in London. He has been in the job for eight years."The U.K. regulatory regime for banks was poorly designed and has been woefully inadequate in dealing with high-profile, high-risk financial problems. The regulator and the banks have repeatedly failed to ensure that bank wrongdoing is detected and prosecuted effectively and efficiently. The U.K. economic and political environment continues to be very difficult for U.K. banks and firms and does not provide the incentive or the governance and culture to tackle this problem effectively," the report said."Barclays' actions may seem minor in comparison with some of the other scandals the U.K. banking sector is involved in, but they have had a significant impact on the integrity of the financial markets and have undermined the confidence of their clients."Barclays, along with U.S. based JP Morgan and Barclays Capital, were in court over Libor rates. The rate is used to set interest rates on debt as well as assess creditworthiness. Barclays pleaded guilty earlier this year to manipulating Libor rates.The scandal led to a U.K. inquiry which found that senior bank executives knew about the manipulation for years but did nothing to correct the problem.The Treasury Select Committee report said that Barclays' culture meant it didn't have the "inherent capacity" to police itself and that it was only recently that a full-fledged unit to monitor and prevent such actions for future wrongdoing was established."Barclays' failure is a tragic illustration of how effective the regulatory system can be when it is properly designed and designed for purpose. Unfortunately, the regulatory system is not well designed and was seriously flawed when Barclays was first charged with wrongdoing" said Committee Chairman John Mann."Barclays' actions were a result of its culture of failure which failed to acknowledge and remedy wrongdoing and lack of corporate responsibility. It was only when Barclays was properly challenged with its culture that new processes emerged to ensure	0
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thanked Tajikistan's president Saturday for his country's support of efforts to defeat al-Qaeda and bring security to neighboring Afghanistan. Clinton later flew to Uzbekistan, where she discussed Afghanistan, human rights and economic ties. In her first visit to the central Asian country of Tajikistan, she also addressed concerns about human rights and the need to bring more economic opportunities during a town hall meeting earlier in the day. Clinton and President Emomali Rahmon "talked about our work to improve Tajikistan's security, particularly along the border with Afghanistan, and to combat drug trafficking," Clinton told reporters Saturday. She praised Tajikistan's progress in stopping human traffickers who force women and children to work in cotton fields without pay. But Clinton said the country still faces important challenges. "Tajik citizens deserve the opportunity to receive a decent education, own land, practice whatever religion they choose, enjoy a free and independent media, and participate equally in the political process," Clinton said at the town hall meeting, sponsored by the Aga Khan Development Network. "And it is up to their leaders to ensure that fundamental freedoms, including religious freedom, are protected for all people: men and women, young and old." Several reporters have been arrested in Tajikistan for reporting on corruption or the arrests of religious activists, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Clinton also said the barriers to increased trade are significant, "but so is the potential." "That is why the United States supports what we're calling the New Silk Road: a network of transit and trade connections that will open new markets for raw materials, energy, and agricultural products for every nation in the region, including Tajikistan," she said. Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the region and was embroiled in civil war until 1997. It shares a 1,400-kilometer border with Afghanistan, "large parts of which are quite porous," making the country vulnerable to extremists, a senior state department official said. "The New Silk Road holds the potential to help spur growth, create jobs, invigorate the private sector, and integrate Tajikistan into the South and Central Asia economy," Clinton said. "It would also help bring stability to your neighbors in Afghanistan by expanding their economic ties throughout the region."	1
A Russian jetliner crashed on landing in the city of Kazan, killing all 50 aboard, authorities there reported Sunday. Tatarstan Airlines flight 363 carried 44 passengers and a crew of six,   the airline confirmed. No passengers were on the flight when it crashed while attempting to land at Kazan's Sheremetyevo Airport, which is about 40 miles from the city. The plane was carrying more than 200 passengers.According to local authorities, the Russian pilot, who died in the tragedy, was operating the plane on a test flight after it was grounded at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Russian news agencies cited Tatarstan's press secretary as saying the crash was caused by the jet hitting a flock of birds that was flying over the runway. The birds, which may have hit the aircraft when the jet was only a few meters from the runway, "flipped it upside down," he said. He added that the aircraft may have struck another flock of birds in the air while landing the plane.Russian authorities have confirmed that the two pilots, both of whom were originally reported to have been on a business trip, were reported on Saturday to have been on their regular work trips. The flight was on its way from Moscow to Kazan when it crashed. It was carrying 154 passengers, including 38 children, according to the Kazan government.The passengers include 43 children from the local Kazan Primary School. All their parents were killed, said an unnamed source, speaking for the country's media.Many of the dead have been identified as students at Kazan's local Leningrad State University. One of the deceased was the school's rector, Anatolii Gershunikov.President Vladimir Putin said he would personally seek to ensure Russia's help for rescue operations. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, speaking on television, identified as "a respected Russian citizen," said the plane had been preparing to land at the airport after refueling in Moscow and was taking off again when it crashed into the forest close to the airport."I ask you to go to that area of the forest because there are some trees near there ... and check if there were any birds there or some birds of any kind," Putin said.U.S. President Barack Obama called the crash "the saddest day for our country.""Our hearts go out to the loved ones of the victims,"	0
Two U.S. spacecraft are set to crash on the moon Friday. On purpose. And we're all invited to watch. An artist's rendering shows the LCROSS spacecraft, left, separating from its Centaur rocket. NASA's Lunar   Exploration Analysis Group wants to see how close the two would have to come in order to make the impact. Photo: NASASitting in a high-tech white room overlooking the Mojave Desert, NASA scientists are planning to witness the two U.S. spacecraft on the far side of the moon Friday afternoon. The LCROSS mission is expected to achieve a soft touchdown on the moon's surface at 3:56 p.m. EDT, when the Centaur rocket is expected to ignite a four-minute burn to separate the spacecraft from the Centaur.The LCROSS experiment is designed to observe how the moon's gravitational field affects the orbits of spacecraft, in this case Centaur and LCROSS, on the moon as they attempt to rendezvous before impact in the final minutes of the mission. If the impact is not as planned, the mission could become a historical event. In this scenario, it could be called the first moon impact mission.On the other hand, if LCROSS is successful in the rendezvous, the spacecraft will then perform a series of maneuvers designed to place them into a lunar orbit before they make their approach for the impact splashdown. If the impact is successful, LCROSS will fire a laser to collect data that will help scientists learn more about how a spacecraft and its rocket work on a sub-surface target.Friday's event is the culmination to years of planning by the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The public is invited to watch LCROSS and Centaur make their rendezvous, and then watch them crash into the moon. They will be able to see all this unfold from a distance of more than 60,000 miles."We know that the world has never seen anything quite like this," said JPL scientist and director of the LEAG, Dan Werthimer. "There's no doubt that the mission could go awry and end up being an historic moment in space, but the goal is to make sure that we can see the full event together."And there's no shortage of curiosity."I'm so excited we can	0
As Google prepares to add a new category to its arsenal of portable devices with tablets, the company's mobile team is deploying ways to better tie its different systems together. It might not come as a surprise that the internet giant is using the Web to do that. Like smartphones, this new breed of tablets will run Android, an operating system developed by Google. This next version of Android, called 3.0 or Honeycomb, is its first designed for tablets but will also run on smartphones. Like Apple does with its closed system, Honeycomb will let users buy applications on computers and synchronize them between their Google gadgets. Using the Android Market website in a browser, you can browse, buy and download apps, Google announced at a news conference on the company's main campus here on Wednesday. From the website, users can beam the app to any number of phones or tablets connected to their accounts. The phone begins downloading the app almost instantly. This feature has already been enabled automatically on Android phones. Previously, you'd have to open the Android app on a smartphone in order to search for and download programs. Synchronizing between other family members' phones, for example, was a hassle. In Apple's controlled habitat, the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad share information and apps via a central hub in the iTunes software. "There are no wires, no syncing to computers, none of that kind of nonsense," Chris Yerga, Android's engineering director for cloud services, said onstage at the Android event. "Everything just works seamlessly, syncing between the two." The announcement reinforces Google's philosophy of doing everything over the internet, or "cloud" in industry parlance. Android already synchronizes personal information such as e-mail and contact lists through the Web. "It's the cloud that makes the experience seamless," said Andy Rubin, who leads Android development. But the synchronization features will mean little if Google can't persuade smartphone customers to purchase upcoming Android tablets. So much of Wednesday's event was focused on a walkthrough of new features that will be available to these devices. A new app called Music brings the Android system closer in line with Apple's iPod-iPhone-iPad model. Albums and songs are organized in a screen with a heavy emphasis on cover artwork.	1
As they took their seats on a TransAsia Airways flight that crashed in Taipei on Wednesday, Lin Ming-wei and his young family were looking forward to a vacation on Kinmen, an island in the Taiwan Strait. Minutes later, urns were found inside the Boeing 747, and their flight was canceled.It was the second deadly crash of a Boeing 747 in Taiwan in recent years — and the only one at Taiwan’s main hub. In January 2008, the twin-engine aircraft that flew to Taipei from Sydney, Australia, with 186 people on board, crashed after suffering a “cavitation” — a sudden, violent impact — caused by a bird strike.The crash is being treated as a possible “runaway” accident, according to Taiwanese authorities. They are investigating the flight more closely than the previous one.But the question of the pilots’ mental and physical fitness is front and center now, said Jens Nordahl, an accident investigator at the Swedish Transport Accident Investigation Board. The investigation will determine if Taiwan has good or poor air accident records, he said.“This investigation is of major importance to the Taiwanese air-transport industry,” said Nordahl, whose board is responsible for investigating the causes of air accident fatalities.Nordahl has asked the board to investigate the last two fatal crashes in two countries, but the board is not investigating two more incidents, he said. He believes a decision will be made soon. “I cannot say when,” he said.Nordahl said it will be necessary to do more than just examine the planes’ flight logs and check passenger statements for mental health issues.The investigation may go beyond an autopsy to look at medical records, insurance company information and even pilots’ previous jobs and home addresses, Nordahl said.In a telephone interview, Lin, 47, said the crash was a “freak accident” and said his company, which had the planes, had not been involved.“We were just trying to go to Kinmen to show our support,” Lin said.Lin said he had never received an air accident report from the Swedish Transport Accident Investigation Board. A spokesperson for the department declined to comment, referring questions to Lin, who lives in Taipei.The Swedish government’s investigation in	0
The Somali government has asked Russia to intervene against pirates who have seized a Ukrainian cargo ship, the Somali ambassador to Russia said Wednesday. The U.S. Navy released this observance  photo of the MV Faina, which is loaded with weapons and tanks. But the Russian navy issued a statement later in the day saying it had no intention of using force against the pirates, the Russian news agency Interfax reported. "The questions of freeing the ships and crew are being dealt with in line with the corresponding international practices," Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo as saying. "For understandable reasons, the use of force would be an extreme measure because it could threaten the life of the international crew of the ship." The pirates took over the MV Faina last week off the coast of Somalia and are demanding a $20 million ransom for the ship's cargo of 33 Soviet-made T-72 tanks, tank artillery shells, grenade launchers and small arms. The ship is anchored within Somalia's 12-mile territorial limit. "The government and the president of Somalia are allowing the Russian naval ships to enter our waters, and fight against pirates both in the sea and on the land, that is, if they would have to chase them," Amb. Mohamed Handule said at a news conference in Moscow. "We think that this issue of piracy has exceeded all limits. It is very dangerous that pirates are now laying their hands on arms -- not just for Somalia, not only for the navigating, but for the entire region in general," he added. "Right now, pirates are controlling the sea in this area, but just imagine if they get control of the land too." The announcement raised concern among some officials monitoring the situation.

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling says he's sorry but feels he was "baited" to make racist comments, nearly two weeks after the NBA fined him and banned him for life for his remarks in a recorded conversation. "When I listen to that tape, I don't even know how I can say words like that. ... I don't know why the girl had me say those things," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview set to air on Monday. "You're saying you were set up?" Cooper asked. "Well yes, I was baited," Sterling said. "I mean, that's not the way I talk. I don't talk about people for one thing, ever. I talk about ideas and other things. I don't talk about people." Sterling, an 80-year-old married lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, hasn't spoken publicly about the accusations since celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording of him that drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league. In that audio clip, Sterling chastised friend V. Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin "Magic" Johnson. The recording triggered a firestorm that led to Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. "I'm not a racist," Sterling told Cooper. "I made a terrible, terrible mistake. And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I've hurt." Asked by Cooper why he took so long to say he's sorry, Sterling said he was "emotionally distraught." "The reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong. I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it," he said. Sterling said he doesn't want his comments to eclipse his lengthy tenure with the NBA. "I'm a good member who made a mistake and I'm apologizing and I'm asking for forgiveness," he said. "Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."	1
Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. Mexico police round up gang suspects in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. CAMARGO, Mexico (CNN) -- There are no welcome signs on the approach to Camargo. It's a hardscrabble Mexican border town and home turf for "Los Zetas," a gang of hitmen and corrupt former special forces cops on the bankroll of the Gulf Cartel. Local journalists explained if we went there we'd be getting "tangled up in the hooves of the horse." They said Zeta gunmen recently smashed one reporter's fingers with a hammer as a warning to the media to stay away. The plaza was deserted -- for a few minutes at least. Then the throb of engines broke the Sunday morning peace. Scores of pickup trucks with heavily tinted windows began circling. Occasionally a window would crack open. We were clearly being watched. A black SUV pulled up alongside the soda stand. One of the occupants stepped out. First I saw the ostrich skin cowboy boots, then the highly polished 9 mm pistol strapped to his side. It was loaded with a longer-than-usual ammunition clip, custom-made to pack extra bullets. It was a brazen flouting of Mexican law to carry a gun that way. No words. Not even a stare. But his message seemed unequivocal. Our visit to Camargo lasted just 20 minutes. Taking the strong hint, we immediately left town. Much as we wanted to explore the underbelly of the drug war raging in Mexico, it was clear the capos, or bosses, and their hired guns were in no mood to talk. Their business thrives best in the shadows. Our best chance of getting some insight was to track down a cast of peripheral characters who live in the gray areas, somewhere between the extremes of right and wrong. The hospitality was little better in nearby Miguel Aleman. Customers, even an argumentative drunk, fell silent as we ordered a beer in a dingy cantina. A couple of tired-looking prostitutes retreated to a far corner. They may have been down on their luck but they knew talking to outsiders wasn't worth the cost. Here the Zetas are well-known for enforcing their law of silence at gunpoint.  Watch Mexican cops on the hunt for gang members »	1
When powerlifting coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis wanted to create a winning formula for her athletes, she didn't head to the weight room. Instead, she found herself in the classroom. Coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis with athletes from Great Britain's powerlifting team. Head coach of Great Britain's powerlifting squad, Vaughan-Ellis  participated in a course that's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches. Vaughan-Ellis's responsibilities run the gamut from identifying up-and-coming talent to developing training programs. She had friends who were corporate performance directors, and realizing the skills they had were applicable to her own line of work, she decided to pursue a professional development course designed for coaches. "We expect athletes to be the best they can be. Our responsibility as coaches is to be the best we can be," Vaughan-Ellis told CNN. In pursuit of becoming better managers and leaders, players in the business world have long turned to executive education programs. Elite coaches are taking a cue from business and turning to tailored programs too. In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course. "A lot of coach development work [in the UK] is ad hoc. It's becoming more clearly defined, but our vision is to establish a more development pathway for coaches," he told CNN. Vaughan-Ellis trains about 20 powerlifters as part of a program that was established to prepare athletes in Great Britain for major competitive events like the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. Nutritionists, psychologists, fitness coaches and sports scientists are all focused on a goal of helping athletes achieve a performance edge, she says. But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes. That requires a broad range of skills, from understanding the athlete experience and identifying particular challenges they may encounter as well as having a firm understanding of where funding comes from and making sure it's spent wisely "We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world. But we also have to make sure that we are making the best choices for them," she said. Ashridge, which specializes in customized education programs, has been running sport coaching courses since 2001. Its core World Class Sport Coach Development program is endorsed by the British Olympic Association.	1
