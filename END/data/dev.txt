Tom Wagner woke up Friday night and the plane cabin was dark. And empty. Completely empty. He looked around from his window seat near the back of the jet and wondered, "What is going on?" He tried the jet door. It was locked. Not knowing what else to do, he phoned his girlfriend and said, "Debbie, you gotta call the airlines. I'm locked in the plane." She didn't quite believe him and started laughing. "I said I'm serious," Wagner explained Monday morning on CNN's "New Day," chuckling about the conversation. "She finally hung up and called the airlines." About 30 minutes later, the door opened. Wagner, from Louisiana, was on his way to California to see his sister. The plane had a layover in Houston, Wagner said, so he took his hat off and took a nap. Apparently a very deep sleeper, he didn't wake up when the plane landed. And somehow when airline employees were doing their usual sweep of the plane, they missed him. Dozens of passengers left the plane and so did the flight crew. Wagner said he walked around the plane in the dark trying to figure out the best thing to do. He said eventually workers opened the plane doors and, startled, asked him what he was doing in there. He tried to explain calmly that he'd been left behind. After his ordeal, he's been talking about what happened. "I talk to people, (and they say) like, man, I'd have freaked out!" Wagner stayed in a hotel room, on the airline, before flying to California the next day. He said United gave him a $250 voucher. The flight was operated by ExpressJet, a United partner. "ExpressJet is investigating to determine how this occurred. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused for the passenger," the carrier said Saturday in a written statement. ExpressJet told CNN affiliate KTRK there was a post-flight cabin inspection, but the company couldn't explain how Wagner was overlooked.

A cargo train derailed and crashed into homes Sunday in a sprawling Kenyan slum, the Red Cross said. Rescue efforts are under way to free residents trapped in damaged homes in the capital city of Nairobi, the agency said. At least five people were transported to a local hospital, Red Cross said on its Twitter page. Kibera -- one of Africa's largest slums -- is filled with rows of homes made from a mixture of mud, tin, wood and concrete. A railway passes through the neighborhood. The settlement is home to hundreds of thousands. CNN's Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report	1
Zsa Zsa Gabor's Bel Air mansion, which offers an expansive -- and expensive -- view of Los Angeles, officially hits the real estate market for sale Tuesday, according to the realtor who is listing the property. The Hollywood Regency-style mansion, built in 1955, carries a listing price of $15 million, Beverly Hills real estate agent Christophe Choo said Monday. It will be officially posted on the multiple listing service Tuesday, Choo said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, announced several months ago that he wanted to sell the house for $28 million because of the high cost of caring for his 94-year-old wife, who has been in poor health for years. The 6,400-square-foot house sits on more than an acre of prime land on a promontory on exclusive Bel Air Road. Music producer Quincy Jones lives next door. Gabor moved into the home about 35 years ago, about 10 years before she married von Anhalt, who is her ninth husband. At least one neighbor may be glad to see the couple move. Von Anhalt, 67, placed two porcelain toilets on his lawn facing the home of an adjacent property owner with whom he had a feud, the prince said in a CNN interview last year. The upper terrace offers a commanding view of downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica, the ocean and Catalina Island. Gabor has suffered major health problems in the last year, including hip replacement surgery and a leg amputation. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident. Her husband, when he first disclosed his intention to sell the home, said that he and his wife needed to pare down expenses. Maintaining the large house and paying for its staff, including nurses for his wife, cost about $35,000 a month, he said. He would like to move with his wife into a condo along Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles, closer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Gabor has spent much of her time in the past year, he said. Gabor's only child, Francesca Hilton, has questioned her stepfather's legal right to put the house on the market. The couple signed a prenuptial agreement before their wedding 25 years ago giving him no ownership in the property, Hilton said.	1
The government of Peru on Friday declared a state of emergency in a remote northern area after a clash between police and indigenous people protesting what they say is the exploitation of their native lands left a number of  dead and dozens injured.The government's announcement was widely condemned by human rights organisations, who said it was unacceptable that there was violence in the first place.The clashes took place near the community of Chultun, in the province of Apurímac, on the border with Ecuador, following protests in response to the alleged mistreatment by local police of three members of the Kankanae tribe who had allegedly been arrested for drug offenses."We protest the death of seven members of Kankanae community who died on the way to a hospital. We protest the death to several persons from another community and injured," said Carlos Romero, a leader of the protests."The police attacked and fired at the crowd before firing rubber bullets against the crowd," he said, adding that the protesters included women and children as well as men, with about 10 people being injured, with some losing eyesight.Peru's president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, told reporters in the regional capital of Trujillo that he had called on the army to help protect the people of Chultun as well as other indigenous areas around the country."Chultun is a place where people can come to seek their rights. We must look at things from the point of view of respecting human rights," he said."There is an issue of respect of human rights. That should mean respecting the right of indigenous people (to live) on their ancestral lands," Kuczynski said."The government of Peru is committed to ensuring that all citizens are safe," he said.In the US, the chairman of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that on its website, its cybercrime centres were reporting nearly 1m requests in the first half of this year for services related to cyber crime.James Comey, the FBI director, told the BBC that in the US alone, the FBI was getting more requests for help from victims of cyber crimes. He said such crimes include phishing (people impersonating a bank or other organisation to steal money), account fraud (people stealing passwords and credentials) and "online terrorism" (an act in which an organisation tries to cause harm using the internet).	0
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic "has the faintest idea" what his organization does after the former world No. 1 said he'd lost faith in the iced-tea-sipping world governing body."It's not even close to being possible for someone to be a part of this organization and not have some knowledge of what's going on," Fahey told CNN's Chris Cuomo in a sit-down interview that aired on Thursday."This is a government-like organization, and they operate according to rules, and some of those rules are very bizarre. It's very difficult for an individual to function in an organization that operates this way. It's almost impossible."Djokovic was the only person to sit down with Cuomo during the week-long interview that came just two days after tennis' governing body, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) -- an agency that has been rocked by doping scandals and accusations of an endemic failure to crack down on cheaters -- unveiled a new doping program that would allow players to use testosterone, an anabolic steroid, and EPO - blood plasma that contains a hormone that boosts red blood cell production - as a way to gain extra muscle mass. After the interview aired, Djokovic addressed the issue in a press release published on Saturday."I do not have confidence in WADA's ability to protect the sport and address the issues related to doping and cheating," Djokovic said. "This is only one step. The fight against doping and cheating is far from over, and this new program is just the beginning of further necessary steps toward transparency and accountability."I will continue to fight to fight doping - this is a fight that must be won, not won in the way that this organization has started. I fully support all efforts to eliminate and prevent doping in tennis."A day after the new program was released, President Juan M. Ponce De Leon resigned from his post as president of the ITF and announced he would step down as executive secretary of the ITF-recognized WADA.When asked on Thursday if he has confidence in Djokovic or in any other WADA member, Fahey said: "Well, I don't see that they have the faintest idea of what their job is.""They're not just	0

Thailand's military announced Thursday that it has taken control of the government. Here's what that means for travelers visiting one of Asia's most popular tourist destinations. The biggest implication of the coup -- declared after rival factions were unable  to agree on a new government -- is that the military will oversee the country's daily lives, including elections in 2018 and the constitution in 2020. The biggest impact is that the junta has said it will be in charge when the military assumes full control of the government, and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has vowed to keep up the fight to protect public order in the face of the military takeover."This day has been set aside to honor and uphold the democratic principles of the country," said Major General Chaturon Nainggalyakosum, commander of the military's anti-crackdown unit. "In the past two days the people's will is being realized and to achieve a stable society and a prosperous country, we need to maintain political stability ... and to preserve the constitution."JUST WATCHED Thailand military junta declares coup Replay More Videos ...

While Labor Day is the unofficial end of summer, it's also the unofficial start to the campaign season. That means politicking will be on the rise, especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses. So, if you turn on your   to watch the Super Bowl or a college football game, you might just miss out on candidates coming out with some of the biggest, most dramatic political plans.Instead, the news is probably more interesting than the election results will be. Here are some of the most impactful political events we should be seeing, regardless of whether or not the election is close or if the candidates in the major races have the best or worst election night of all time*.1.

A South Florida man killed his wife and son with a crossbow, drove 460 miles to try and kill his other son, and then slit his own throat. The violent, long-distance rampage took Pedro Maldonado Sr. from one end of iced-over Florida to the other. Then it was on to Mexico.In a bizarre and sadistic murder of a father and son that has horrified southern Florida, Pedro Maldonado Sr. used a crossbow to kill his wife, and then slit his own throat. Then, he hit his way north to Mexico and died before authorities could get to him."This was a very, very horrible man. He was a great guy, and he was a very great father, father-in-law, grandchild of a grandchild."I can't express how sad and what a terrible loss for our family and for our city and our state."He was buried Monday in a private ceremony in Jacksonville, where he spent his final days with his family.According to reports, before he plowed across Florida, Maldonado Sr. made a 911 call. He said, "My wife and my two children are dead. I'm sorry. Please help me."But his call wasn't long in coming. Police found his wife's body in the family's home, killed by what detectives believe was a crossbow. She was found dead on the kitchen floor with a .308-caliber gunshot wound to the head.The two younger boys, ages four and seven, were found in the bedroom, and their father was found in the bathtub with a bullet graze to his throat.The father had a different explanation for killing his wife, who he had met when she went to school at a nearby school, but investigators have not yet determined the exact cause of their demise."We have several theories that we are pursuing," said Lee's Chief Assistant Medical Examiner Craig McAdams, noting that the father's family members are not cooperating with the investigation.Authorities believe the father, who had been working as a carpenter at a local shop, may have been the one who killed them, but have not determined why."I don't know the reason, I'm sorry. I wish I could be of more help," he said."We don't know why he did it, as I said.	0
The blaze that killed two Boston firefighters last week was unintentionally caused by a welding operation, Boston fire officials said Friday. But prosecutors have yet to determine whether anyone was criminally culpable, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. The welders did not have a required permit. The nine-alarm fire occurred on March 26 at a brick brownstone in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. Lt. Edward Walsh, 43, and firefighter Michael Kennedy, 33, were killed. Thirteen other firefighters were injured. Fire Commissioner John Hasson told reporters that the blaze was caused by sparks from welding in the rear of the building. The sparks probably festered in the wooden structure, with flames later fed by strong winds off the Charles River. "We're confident this was an unintentional death at this time," Evans said. "Whether anyone should be held culpable for this event, as the investigation goes on, that will be a determination made by investigators in the District Attorney's Office." Ed Zabin, chief of the homicide unit for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said investigators would try to determine whether anyone was criminally responsible. He said welders were installing an iron hand rail behind the building. Evans and Hasson said that no fire detail was present at the job site and that the welders did not have a required permit. "In most cases," Hasson said, "a fire detail is required." Walsh had worked with the Boston Fire Department for close to 10 years, and Kennedy had 6Â½ years on the job. Walsh was married with three children, all under the age of 10. Kennedy was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. Walsh and Kennedy were trapped soon after entering the building. They were later found in the basement, where the fire appeared to have started. Fueled by strong winds, flames quickly engulfed the four-story building. An explosion at one point threw a number of firefighters down stairs. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.	1
An attack by suspected ISIS militants on a border guard base near the Syrian border left at least 16  killed and four others seriously wounded according to Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar provincial council in Iraq. The militants slaughtered the 16 border guards, including their commanding officer, in a surprise early morning attack on Monday, al-Issawi said. Four others are in critical condition, he said. The base attacked is near al-Waleed border crossing, the only crossing Iraq has with Syria that is still controlled by Iraqi forces. ISIS maintains control of almost all of Anbar -- Iraq's largest province.	1
After nearly going to war last year over a Colombian military raid inside Ecuador, the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago. Then an Ecuadorian judge issued an arrest warrant  for Ecuadorean authorities for alleged human rights abuses against indigenous people — an example of what could otherwise be a positive development. “I think the message is clear, that in Latin America there is no room for impunity, and that we have to be on the right track in moving forward to build a better future,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told reporters last June. He was referring to the Colombian military raid, which was a rare example of the U.S.-backed military intervention in the region, which began more than two decades ago.The incident at the center of this case occurred on May 14 when Ecuadoreans were protesting for land rights and environmental rights in the Amazon. A number of Ecuadorean police forces, accompanied by their U.S. counterparts, arrived to quell the protests and kill some protesters. The Ecuadorean police, on the other hand, killed another 20 people, while a number of indigenous and environmental defenders participated in the action, but was not directly involved in the police operation. The U.S. government immediately blamed the police operation on members of Venezuela’s opposition, as well as the mayor of the region and a senior military officer. The U.S. has never given a concrete timeline as to when the situation in Colombia would revert to the normal, peaceful course.The U.S. and Colombia have been at odds over the drug war for some time and have had many incidents in the region as a result. In May, the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the countries were at odds over Colombia’s “wanton violence.” Last month, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. was “taking action” against the Ecuadorean government. “I mean, take action,” Bolton said, referring to the threat to deport the Ecuadorean ambassador, to which the Ecuadorean government responded with warnings to the United States to stop threatening the country.With the Colombian government not showing signs of going back to the status quo, the U.S. has indicated it intends to ratchet up pressure against the Ecu	0

Ã¢Â?Â?Peter said he did not know why his father killed himself. Ã¢Â?Â?He was always a positive person,Ã¢Â?Â? Ã¢Â?Â?he said, but now that is gone.Ã¢Â?Â?INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - When you are thinking about giving gifts, a holiday or birthday, you know that you need to consider the needs of the other person.You could ask yourself: Are they having a good day? Are they having a bad day? If you are giving to someone, you may consider their needs rather than your own. A better gift doesn't have to come at the expense of your loved one's well-being.You have a limited, and sometimes inadequate, amount of time to think about the people you are considering gifts for. And you know, sometimes you need a break from the thought process while you are giving to another.So why not think about the other person's needs?Here is an example:A man is driving in his car, thinking about giving gifts to those close to him. He is on his way to his son's birthday. He is thinking about his son's birthday, but he is also thinking about a woman sitting in the backseat, his son's girlfriend. The son is still talking to the woman, so the man continues down the highway. Just as he is thinking that he may be late for his son's birthday, the son stops talking to the woman. Then the entire family decides that the woman is very nice, and to him, he doesn't know why she just didn't speak to	0
Twelve people walked into a Colorado movie theater late one July night, expecting to enjoy a special midnight screening of the Batman film, "The Dark Knight Rises." They didn't walk out. Their deaths -- and injuries to dozens of others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mostly suicides or accidental deaths Ã¢â‚¬â€œ had a profound effect on how the world perceives the dangers of suicide and mental illness in our modern era of smartphones and social media.A gunman killed movie-goer James Holmes in a Colorado theater in July 2012 Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP)The incident led to a media frenzy over a debate about whether suicide rates in the U.S. have risen more quickly than in other industrialized nations. A number of studies have called into question a number of claims associated with the so-called suicide epidemic, such as that suicide rates are increasing at twice the rate of other developed countries. And in the past several months, Colorado's attorney general has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Aurora, Colorado's largest city, and its police chief -- claiming the police failed to properly investigate a number of high-profile suicides that occurred in Aurora in the months before Holmes's death.While most of the research in the debate is coming from academic experts, as well as media reports, other experts have not been so careful. In one of the most exhaustive studies of the matter, Dr. Elizabeth Ward of the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta compared the suicide rates of cities and counties nationwide as well as several other studies, and came to the surprising conclusion that "Suicide rates in the U.S. are rising faster than in most other developed countries."While "rates" are not the same as "decreases," suicide is an incredibly tragic event that can devastate the families of suicide victims. Suicide is considered preventable, but a lot of people have been slow to recognize the importance of prevention. This is a story about why it is important to educate ourselves about this issue, and why we need to keep an open mind about suicide. It's a story about the importance of suicide research and treatment. And it's a story about how to prevent more tragedies like the one that occurred in Aurora last year.The Aurora ShootingWe all know the story of the Aurora theater rampage --	0
Federal support for renewable power helped the United States reclaim from China the title of the world's biggest investor in clean energy, researchers for the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts reported Wednesday. The $48 billion in U.S. financing for renewable and other clean-economy projects since 2000 has tripled the growth rate of clean-energy investment in the U.S., the report said. China's investment and capacity building in clean tech in the past decade has been minimal, compared with the U.S.'s massive support for renewables and clean energy. "We see a long-term shift underway toward U.S. leadership, driven by the U.S. market, domestic policies and growing interest by U.S. industries, particularly the renewable energy industry," said Ken Kimmell, director of the Pew Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Project.The Pew report is part of a weeklong series of reports and public forums on the economic, environmental, and social costs of fossil fuels at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory. The Argonne report analyzes the risks posed by coal, oil, and gas to our environment, economy and society and the ways in which they have been addressed by DOE and other federal agencies. Argonne researchers are working on the report in partnership with colleagues at several other federal agencies, several universities, and environmental and business groups.Two months after a federal court order barred a Texas fertilizer plant, owned by Koch Industries, from injecting more toxic and cancer-causing chemicals into groundwater and drinking water, government officials are investigating if the plant is violating another federal law that regulates water use. Earlier this month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials sent a letter to the agency's chief, Kathleen Hartnett White, urging her to investigate "whether the facilities have violated the Safe Drinking Water Act by not complying with certain requirements regarding waste treatment and water quality.""We are concerned that the plants are violating the Safe Drinking Water Act by not taking steps to ensure safe water quality," said U.S. EPA spokesman Mark Weinberger in an interview. "Any company could potentially be subject to the safe drinking water act. It's a comprehensive, multi-faceted program that requires the federal government to ensure safe drinking water."The EPA's request to White comes a week after three U.S. senators called for a federal investigation into the chemical safety of	0
To watch or not to watch. That is the question for 12 jurors and six alternates in the Massachusetts murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez when the region's beloved Patriots play in Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury. "I am not going to forbid you from watching the Super Bowl if that's something that's really important to you," she said. But the judge closed the second day of testimony by advising jurors to be vigilant for mention of Hernandez, who helped lead the Patriots to Super Bowl XLVI nearly three years ago. "You hear that word, you've got to walk out of the room," Garsh said. "Distance yourself." Hernandez will not be watching his former team. He's incarcerated in a high security unit where prisoners are forbidden from watching TV. Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. As she did one day earlier, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, walked out of the courtroom sobbing as prosecutors showed the jury graphic photos of her son's body. Lloyd, who was shot six times, was shown lying on his back in the industrial park where his body was found. Later Friday, Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd at the time of his death, took the witness stand. Her sister, Shayanna, is Hernandez's fiancee and mother of his child. Shaneah Jenkins testified that she introduced Lloyd to Hernandez on her birthday in August 2012. Jenkins told the jury that Lloyd and Hernandez were in the "beginning stages of a friendship." She said the two men and others would gather in Hernandez's basement "man cave" -- with fitness and theater rooms, a bar and pool table emblazoned with the Patriots' logo -- to smoke marijuana. But Jenkins said she was not aware of her boyfriend and Hernandez hanging out except for the day Lloyd was killed. In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd.	1
As investigators are determining whether a skull and bones discovered behind an abandoned Central Virginia home on Saturday are those of Hannah Graham, the lone suspect in her disappearance has been indicted in an assault from almost a  year ago.A grand jury in Roanoke County returned the indictment on Tuesday against the suspect, 42-year-old Edward James, for a December 2012 domestic assault.Jurors found James guilty of misdemeanor assault and battery and misdemeanor unlawful wounding for causing injuries to a woman who previously lived in his home. They also found him guilty of misdemeanor disorderly conduct for disrupting someone’s gathering.Hannah Graham, 24, disappeared in June 2012 after leaving a friend’s house in Virginia. Her remains were found a month later by a jogger on an abandoned lot near the James River in Vienna, Virginia.An autopsy on her body determined she died from blunt force trauma.Authorities told CNN that James had gone to court on Monday over the indictment. A judge denied James’ request for a postponement of the trial date until James’ finances are adjusted so he can get his life back in order.The indictment followed a press conference held by the Virginia State Police yesterday in which authorities announced the indictment and the discovery of the skull and bones.In June 2012, Virginia State Trooper David Wray spotted Hannah in the woods off of Route 60 in Vienna.“The circumstances of her being spotted in the woods off of Route 60 is not explained by the information that’s available at this time. We don’t know what was going on. We don’t know why she was there,” said David Wray.“The only information that’s available to us at this time is the information that she was taken to the hospital after she was discovered,” he added.State Trooper Wray said that a medical evaluation determined Hannah was alive when they found her in the woods, but she died later that day.State police said they do not know if her body was taken to a crime scene.Investigators said they are continuing to check out leads in the case.James is being held at the Rappahannock Regional Jail without bond.CNN reported that investigators were told Hannah was with friends Friday when she left around 4:00 p.m.They said they saw a car	0
An American military refueling plane took off and crashed in Kyrgyzstan on Friday, Kyrgyz and U.S. officials said. "The status of the three crew members is unknown," the U.S. 376th Air Expeditionary Wing said in a news release. The plane was a U.S. Air Force KC-135 tanker aircraft, according to the expeditionary wing's Public Affairs Transit Center at Manas, near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The crew and aircraft are assigned to the transit center. The Manas transit center is a U.S. airbase that serves as a supply hub for American forces in Afghanistan. It is located at the Manas airport. The plane crashed in a mountainous area between Chorgolu and Cholok-Aryk -- two villages in the Chuysky region of northern Kyrgyzstan, and a fire crew and three ambulances responded, Elmira Shyrypova, at the Kyrgyz Emergencies Ministry press office. The transit center said investigators are determining the cause of the crash and emergency responders were on the scene Kyrgyz Prime Minister Jantoro Satybaldiev held an emergency meeting in connection with the crash, state media reported. Sharshenaliev said debris from the crash was scattered over an area of about a kilometer radius. He said witnesses calling in on a hotline said they saw a parachute when the plane was falling. Others said they saw an explosion and the plane was broken in half. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Barbara Starr contributed to this report	1
SPOILER ALERT! It's not just women getting cloned. That was the big twist at the end of "Orphan Black's" second season. The kickoff to the new season leads the list of six things to watch in the week ahead. 1. "Orphan Black," 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone. Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones. "We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes," she said. "So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things." And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense. "There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more," she said. The fans of the show, dubbed the "Clone Club" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far. "We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible." 2. "Turn: Washington's Spies," 9 p.m. ET, Monday, AMC The series about spies in the early days of the Revolutionary War returns with a new subtitle, "Washington's Spies," and a new Monday night time slot. Series star Jamie Bell told CNN what we can expect in the second season. "This year we have a lot more battles; we have the journey of [George] Washington and we're getting under his skin a little bit as well. We also introduce new characters like Benedict Arnold, a very infamous character in American history." Bell hopes the series might bring more recognition to the Culper spy ring and everything it did.	1
Investigators are working to determine what caused a helicopter crash in central Peru that killed seven people, including five Americans. The team was supporting oil exploration operations near Pucallpa, Peru, when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed Monday afternoon, according to Columbia Helicopters, the Portland, Oregon-based company that employed the victims. Minutes after the helicopter took off from the Pucallpa Airport, authorities lost communication with the pilot, and people in the control tower could see a heavy smoke column in the distance. A company official said Tuesday that it was unclear what caused the crash. "We've notified all the authorities and are cooperating with everyone fully, and we'll do everything we can to learn any causes ... of the accident," said Michael Fahey, Columbia Helicopters president and CEO. "It's a very sad day for us. We operate globally, but we're a family and we're very close to our employees. And I personally knew many of the individuals who died as our other employees know many of them," Fahey told reporters in Oregon. "We're grieving for them." Columbia Helicopters has dispatched an investigation team to work with Peruvian authorities, Fahey said. The victims were the aircraft's pilots and crew. No other passengers were on board, Columbia Helicopters said. The two Peruvians killed in the crash were Igor Castillo and Luis Ramos. The Americans were identified as Dann Immel, Edwin Cordova, Jaime Pickett, Darrel Birkes and Leon Bradford. A local police chief said three of the bodies were found away from the site of helicopter's crash and explosion, and those bodies had no burn injuries, leading authorities to believe the three passengers jumped out before the crash. Helicopter crashes kill 3, hurt 4 and prompt more scrutiny	1
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder once said to me, in the margins of a European summit: "There must be something weird about Britain that you have the press you have." There is. Also, as I said to the Leveson Inquiry into the practices and standards of the British press set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, one of Rupert Murdoch's Australian editors once said to me: "The British papers are the best in the world, and the worst in the world, sometimes in the same edition." That was an astute observation too. Rupert Murdoch's titles drew most of the fire in the Leveson Inquiry, which also heard outrageous examples of how certain sections of the British newspaper industry treated both the powerful and the weak with contempt, and there are several court cases outstanding as a result of allegations of criminal activity. In the wake of the inquiry many commentators -- and newspaper owners -- argued that any regulation that came out of it would have terrible implications for free speech in Britain. Despite concern among ordinary readers that much of Fleet Street is out of control, the government has yet to introduce formally the independent self-regulation of the newspaper industry recommended by Leveson. This week the Privy Council meets to decide on a course of action. You'd have thought on that basis the press, if only for its own tactical reasons, might at least curb its worst excesses while that process reaches its conclusion, if not even learn the lessons of the public revulsion that accompanied what emerged at the inquiry. But you'd be wrong. Two years ago it was Murdoch's News International that was up to no good. Now the Daily Mail is at the center of a storm as a debate rages following its publication of an article about Labour leader Ed Miliband's father headlined "The Man Who Hated Britain." The story was accompanied on the website by a picture -- later removed -- of Miliband Senior's burial plot captioned "grave socialist." The Mail is certainly commercially successful, one of the few papers still to be selling in good numbers, and now with the most visited newspaper website in the world. But many people in public life -- along with campaigners who protested outside the Mail's offices in West London -- now view the Mail Group itself as the worst polluter of standards and debaser of public life, something I have argued for many years.	1

An entire nation stopped Sunday. Four million people sat watching on their television, hearts palpitating with every movement. It was time. Another 40,000 packed into Schladming with just one hope. Amidst the roars, step forward Marcel Hirscher, the 23-year-old with the weight of all Austria on his shoulders. For two weeks the Austrian public had watched and waited for Hirscher to deliver that moment of magic, that performance which would go down in folklore. On Sunday, faced with his last chance of chance of glory, the home favorite delivered, sealing victory in the men's slalom to spark scenes of wild celebration. The 23-year-old came home in an aggregate of 1min 51.03 seconds, 0.42 seconds ahead of Germany's Felix Neureuther, with fellow Austrian and former two-time world champion Mario Matt, claiming bronze at 0.65 seconds. "It was very difficult," Hirscher told reporters. "It was fierce. What can I say, it's great. "The atmosphere was sensational, it was great. But I was so focused and just tried not to make a mess. It was anything but easy." Hirscher said the lead up to the slalom had been "the toughest week in my life so far". "The whole country was watching me, especially for the slalom. Around four million people were watching on television in Austria and 40,000 are here live in the stadium. If I'd straddled, oh my god, they're going to kill me! "It's definitely good to be the world champion here in my home country." With the cowbells greeting his victorious arrival at the finish line, Hirscher soaked up the adulation in front of an adoring crowd. But while Hirscher was left to reflect on his victory, U.S. star Ted Ligety's bid to win a fourth gold at the championships was ended following an uncharacteristic error. Ligety, who had won gold in the Super-G, super-combined and giant slalom, was the first man to achieve such a feat since Claude Killy in 1968. But his failure around a gate and the sight of his skis breaking free, ended Ligety's attempt to make history. While Ligety failed, Germany's Neureuther had no such problems, claiming silver.	1
As long as there are postmen, life will have zest. So said philosopher William James, though younger generations may question the need for snail mail at all. But Louis Schlamowitz, for one, is grateful to postmen, who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he has spent all his life. In that box came words and photographs from the famous -- and sometimes the infamous. Now, in his closet, he has three jackets hanging, lonely among the 60 photo albums stacked up from the floor and on the shelf. "South America" contains Manuel Noriega. Fidel Castro. "U.S. presidents" includes John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and Harry Truman, who started Schlamowitz on his unusual hobby. Then there's the Middle East album, a veritable assortment of dictators, fallen and felled. Among the likes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Yasser Arafat and Hosni Mubarak is Moammar Gadhafi, whose ignoble death last month earned Schlamowitz himself a bit of instant fame. Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot. To answer that question, Schlamowitz takes his questioners back to 1953, when he was a young Army private in Korea. His buddy had a sole Christmas card left and Schlamowitz decided he would send it to Truman. "He won't reply to me," Schlamowitz thought. "I'm nobody special." But his friend insisted he mail it. "What do you have to lose?" he said. His friend thought wisely, it turns out. A month and a half later, came the response, on presidential stationery. Schlamowitz was inspired. If Truman can write back, why not others? Back in New York, he married, had a daughter, and worked for 35 years designing floral arrangements first at a Manhattan shop, then closer to home in Brooklyn. When he saw someone in the news, he looked up the person's address and dropped a letter in the mail. He was especially fond of politicians and world leaders.	1
Gabriel García Márquez, the influential, Nobel Prize-winning author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in the Time of Cholera," has died, his family and officials said. He was 87. The literary giant was treated  for cancer since 2004, and died Monday, his family said.Márquez published his first novel, "Prayer for a Despised Land" (1972), during his college years at the Universidad de las Americas, in Mexico City. Four years later, he published the collection of short stories "The General in His Labyrinth" (1973). Márquez wrote novels, stories, essays and reviews, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980, for his book of short stories, "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," on which his father had originally based the novel. He later adapted it into a screenplay, "The General in His Labyrinth," for which he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He published poetry, essays and novels, winning a prestigious Golden Prize in 1969 for his novel "Mi vida" (1971). He also created the first Spanish television serial and received two National Book Awards for writing "One Hundred Years of Solitude." The novel, which won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, has sold more than 200 million copies worldwide.Born in 1940 into a privileged, well-educated family, Márquez grew up in poverty in the northern Mexico city of Cuernavaca, where his father was a teacher. He received his primary and secondary education in the United States but returned to Cuernavaca in 1957.  While in the city, Márquez met María Luisa Pinedo, who would go on to become his wife. That same year, he began to translate several Spanish books into Spanish and published his first book. He served in the army for a short time during the military dictatorship, during which he wrote the political satires "Ficciones" (1964-1965) and "El ingenioso y el desengaño" (1968), published respectively under the titles "The Clever and the Devout" and "The Envious Man" in English. In 1980, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature.In addition to his wife and four children, Márquez is survived by his sister, the novelist Liza Paredes	0
Hurricane Bertha -- the first hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic season -- increased in strength Monday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center. A satellite picture from 5:45 a.m. ET Monday shows Hurricane Bertha over the Atlantic. While Bertha's power may fluctuate over the next day, it is expected to begin gradually weakening by Wednesday, the center's 11 p.m. ET advisory said. Bertha's became a major -- or Category 3 -- hurricane Monday afternoon. A Category 3 has wind speeds of 111 to 130 mph. As of 11 p.m. ET, Bertha was 695 miles (1,115 km) east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and about 1,085 miles (1,745 km) southeast of Bermuda. The eye was moving toward the west-northwest at about 12 mph. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 120 mph (195 km/hr), up from the 115 mph mentioned in a 5 p.m. advisory. The hurricane is expected to turn to the northwest and decrease its forward speed in the next 24 to 48 hours, the center said. There is a very small chance Bertha will make landfall in the United States. Bermuda could be affected by the hurricane this weekend.  See Bertha's projected path » "It is still way too soon to determine whether or not Bertha will affect Bermuda," the center said. The storm formed Thursday in the far eastern Atlantic, off the coast of Africa, near the southern Cape Verde Islands. It strengthened into a hurricane early Monday.

Forget Christmas. December is all about defense for Manchester City. The reigning English Premier League champions maintained their eight-match unbeaten run in all competitions with a 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace, Saturday. City drew level on points with table toppers Chelsea, who will be eager to put daylight between themselves and the defending champions against Stoke City, Monday. "December is a key month to be in the fight for the title," City manager Manuel Pellegrini told reporters after his side's home win. "If you want to be involved you must be very near the top of the table. I hope we continue playing like this. It was a very good win, a very good performance." Crystal Palace had frustrated City during the first half, coming close to scoring themselves, before mercurial forward David Silva sparked into life after the break. The Spaniard broke the deadlock for City -- who are missing key strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko --when his shot deflected off Scott Dan and past Palace keeper Julian Peroni. Silva swept in a second soon afterwards before Yaya Toure drilled in at the near post to make sure of the victory for Man City. Their north of England neighbors and rivals, Manchester United, had to settle for a point from their away trip to Aston Villa. United had been on a six-match winning streak and would have expected more from their trip to Villa Park where they had not lost in 18 matches. Villa's talismanic striker Christian Benteke hit a curler into the corner to give the home side the lead after 18 minutes and deny United a magnificent seventh win. On-loan Colombian striker Radamel Falcao -- who played his first full 90 minutes after being given a place in the starting XI -- scored the equalizer in the second half when he headed in from close range. Villa were reduced to 10 men when Gabriel Agbonlahor was sent off with 25 minutes still to play but the advantage did little for United. "I'm very frustrated," summed up Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, whose side are third in the table and seven points off the leaders. Barcelona said Christmas had come early as Luis Suarez scored his first goal for the Spanish La Liga giants, Saturday. The Uruguayan ace, who joined Barca from Liverpool in a tasty $127m deal, had to wait until October to make his debut following his four-month biting ban.	1
Rafael Nadal has called for stricter doping controls and more transparency to help eradicate drug cheating in tennis. Nadal wants to ensure tennis is not plagued by the doping problems which have affected so many other sports, notably cycling, following the Lance Armstrong saga. "It's something even I don't like to talk about because it has damaged the image of sport, and sport doesn't deserve this kind of thing in my opinion," the 11-time grand slam champion told CNN's Open Court show before his weekend triumph at Indian Wells. "When somebody like Armstrong was an idol for most of the people who loved sport, at the end, you see that was not true. "It's a big disappointment, so I think we need to work together in the same direction to change the situation. It cannot continue like this. "We need to be stricter on a few things. We need to have all the controls made public." Nadal, who made his return to action in February following a seven-month absence with a knee injury, said tennis needs an all-encompassing approach to drug testing in order to maintain the sport's image. "We have to work together, we have to be working together with the administrators and hopefully we can change that terrible situation," he said. "We are lucky that in tennis, it has happened in just very exceptional cases but at the end, tennis is in sport, so if that happens in other sports, it affects tennis too." In recent months sport has been hit by several high-profile doping scandals. Cyclist Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, while Australian sport was given a wake-up call after a government report alleged athletes were using illegal substances supplied by organized criminal groups. Cheating in sport: What are banned substances? Football's governing body FIFA has already stated its intention to introduce biological passports, while the outcome of the Operation Puerto trial in Spain into the relationship between sport and doctor Eufemiano Fuentes' doping network is ongoing. Biological passport The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recently confirmed that it will introduce a biological passport program, a system similar to the one used in cycling, where players' drug test results are kept over a long period of time so that the use of illegal substances is more easily detected.	1
After nearly four years of hoping, waiting and praying, an Ohio family learned Sunday their missing son died in Iraq. A 2004 memorial at Glen Este High School in Ohio in honor of Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin. "It hurts -- it really hurts. You go through four years of hope," said Carolyn Maupin, whose son, Staff Sgt. Keith Matthew Maupin, was captured by insurgents in April 2004. "It's like a letdown to me. I'm trying to get through that right now." His father, Keith Maupin, said military officials informed the family Sunday afternoon that the remains of the 24-year-old Army reservist had been identified. "Every parent knows the possibility exists that they may have to face the death of their child when they volunteer to go to war," he said. "However, those who are fortunate make peace with that and support their soldier, because they enlisted at their own free will." A Defense Department official also confirmed the identification, saying Maupin's remains were found last week but DNA results just came in. Coalition forces found the remains after a local Iraqi tipped them off, military officials said. Maupin, who was 20 at the time of his capture, and another soldier, Sgt. Elmer Krause, 40, were captured by insurgents April 9, 2004, after their convoy came under attack near Baghdad International Airport. A week later, Maupin was shown on a videotape, surrounded by several armed masked men. "My name is Keith Matthew Maupin," he stated in the video. "I am a soldier from the First Division. I am married with a 10-month-old child. I came to liberate Iraq, but I did not come willingly because I wanted to stay with my child." Krause's body was found two weeks later. Later that summer, Al-Jazeera aired a videotape purportedly showing the execution of Maupin, but U.S. officials haven't confirmed the identity of the person on the tape. The U.S. Army continued to promote Maupin, who was a private first class in the Army Reserves at the time of his capture, to sergeant and then staff sergeant as they searched for him.	1
The U.S. Coast Guard has called off its search for as many as 79 Haitians missing after a boat capsized near the Turks and Caicos  (TC) Islands.The U.S. Coast Guard said it had received the information that the boat and its passengers, which included 25 Haitians and 21 Turks and Caicos Islanders, were found off Guahambaye, Haiti on Saturday, Aug. 20.The Coast Guard said it was notified by T&C International‘s vessel that it picked up the abandoned boat on the night of Aug. 9, and immediately alerted the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter GEM. Both vessels and personnel, including Coast Guardsmen, National Security Assistance Officer and an Air Force EOD team conducted a search.“Unfortunately, the boat had capsized and sank while on its way to Haiti,” the Coast Guard said in a press release. “It was not until the morning that the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board personnel were able to determine that a large portion of the passengers were deceased.”The Coast Guard said passengers have been identified as: Arnaud Guilleron, 34, of New York City; Arnaud Gualbert, 28, of New York City; Pauline Gualbert, 30, of New York City; Marie Anne Gualbert, 54, of New York City; Alain Gualbert, 27, of New York City; and Dominique Gualbert, 27 of New York City; and two Turks and Caicos Islanders – Anthony Anthony Pimentel, 49, and his brother, Joseph Pimentel, 47.The passengers are all from New York City, the Coast Guard said.“All of these people are New York citizens and are from different backgrounds. The American flag that was flying on the boat was raised in salute to help them in their time of need,” Capt. Michael D. Lewis of the Coast Guard, said in a written statement.“Our thoughts and our prayers go out to all those involved in this tragedy,” he added.The Coast Guard said it has opened a new case with the National Transportation Safety Board‘s investigation into the July 20th crash.“The investigation is ongoing and no one from the Coast Guard, T&C International or T&C	0
Brazilian public notary Claudia do Nascimento Domingues set off a firestorm by granting Brazil's first civil union to a trio, an act so unprecedented that there isn't a word for it in Portuguese. Uniao poliafetiva is the vernacular name for what would eventually turn out to be the state of Oregon's second-longest known civil partnership, after Washington, D.C.'s.I'm an old woman, but I'm also a historian, and I didn't know that there was a word for this particular practice and its ramifications. It was a story that had never appeared in any of my books or articles. But it is still the kind of thing that stays in the news cycle for months. When I went looking for the word, I quickly realized that it didn't exist in the common vocabulary. People do not use it.This story also happens to be the type of story that is likely to be recounted over and over again in public records, with new details appearing in a new report in a new year. Civil unions have been a part of the Brazilian legal system for decades. They began with a federal law in 1983 that stipulated that couples had the right to "contract, establish, and change civil unions in the same way as marriages". In 2007, the newly elected Brazilian president, Lula da Silva, signed into law the Law of Marriage Equality. He said he had received "legal confirmation" that civil unions were legal.In 2011, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that defined one type of marriage as a "legal marriage", granting couples the right to enter into registered marriages. A second ruling the following year defined the other as a "legal union".Two things happened in this time: First, the Brazilian Parliament amended the law to offer civil unions to same-sex couples as well. Second, the number of civil unions increased. In December last year, there were 831 registered unions in Brazil, a total that had steadily increased. Now there are 10,100.Brazilian civil unions are a different animal. It is hard to compare them to the traditional English term. Many see them as a new concept that reflects a new cultural moment in their history.But while there is no such word, there is a name for it: the civil union has become "the biggest marriage in the world".What is a civil union in Brazil and how does	0
A federal court has ruled in favor of Texas, which wants to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates participating in a health program for low-income women because the family planning network performs abortions. The ruling vacated a lower court's preliminary injunction and opened the way for Texas to sever money to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, which has come under recent attack from anti-abortion politicians. Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised the decision issued late Tuesday by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. "Today's ruling affirms that Texas' Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund organizations that promote abortion -- including Planned Parenthood," Perry said. "The 5th Circuit's decision is a win for Texas women, our rule of law and our state's priority to protect life." Who calls the shots on abortion laws? The Texas Women's Health Program provides about 130,000 low-income women with family planning exams, related health screenings and contraception. Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions and has been in a long-running battle with the federal government. The state said in March that it was willing to give up funding from Washington and run the Women's Health Program itself. It then adopted a rule that required clinics funded by the program to certify they do not perform abortions or are not affiliates of entities that perform abortions. In a letter to Texas officials in March, Medicaid Director Cindy Mann said the state's decision was regrettable. It would, she said, "prevent women enrolled in the program from receiving services from the trusted health care providers they have chosen and relied on for their care." Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care. President Barack Obama denounced the state's efforts during a July campaign stop in Austin. "We're not ending funding for Planned Parenthood," he said. "I think women should have control of their own health care choices, just like men. We're not going backwards." Perry lashed out at Obama on Tuesday. "Texas will continue providing important health services for women through this program in spite of the Obama administration's disregard for our state law and unilateral decision to defund this program," he said. Planned Parenthood has 77 independent local affiliates that operate nearly 800 health centers throughout the United States. In Texas, Planned Parenthood has been the Women's Health Program's largest provider, serving about 40% of patients.	1
Every third Monday in January we gather as Americans to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His tireless advocacy for civil rights, equal protection under the law, labor ills, and equal rights opportunities for all.If you've wondered why I've been absent from the blog for so long, it's because we've been trying to find a way to get this blog off the ground. Well, we found one. On December 1, we launched The Unofficial Blog of Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI).As the representative for the 28th Congressional District of the US House of Representatives, Congressman Sensenbrenner is the ranking minority member of the powerful Rules Committee, the Congressional Oversight and Government Reform Committee.I hope you'll take a minute to visit Rep. Sensenbrenner's site and read the posts we've shared online. This blog (as well as The Unofficial Blog) will be updated regularly with his latest writings. He welcomes your comments, and he hopes that you'll also enjoy and share the ideas that he shares. Please return regularly to see what he's been up to.On January 13th, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the "Roe v. Wade" case. This case is about the legality of abortion across the board. As we know, Roe was a 5-4 decision in which the majority held that women would not be deprived of the right to an abortion.The case involves a Texas woman named Sandra Fluke, who was paid as an intern by the federal government. In so doing, the government violated her privacy. The law of the land was, she believed, that she was not allowed to say that she needed birth control. When she refused to pay the exorbitant sum that Congress had charged her, the law was that she must pay for her birth control. She couldn't make that choice. So she sued in order to get some relief from the law as it is.Some argue that this case is not about abortion at all. They point to the fact that Sandra Fluke is in a position where she can easily afford to pay for the cost of her birth control. Perhaps her money would be a better use of it. Regardless, the point is that this case is about whether a private citizen (who happens to be a public employee) is	0
Andrew Cattaneo is still in shock. It's been only a day since his neighbor across the street, Melissa Ketunuti, was found dead in the basement of her row home Monday afternoon, her hands and feet bound, her body set on fire. Her husband, William, was away at a conference in Connecticut working on research for the Clinton administration's AIDS program at a time when she was being abused by one of her boyfriends, the police said. He was the victim of a crime, the police said. "A person is dead," Ketunuti's sister, Rose, told ABC News in a telephone interview from New Haven, Conn. "What can I tell you?" The death would appear to be an isolated incident, but the circumstances surrounding it are nothing short of shocking. According to the police, William Ketunuti, 37, was found dead in his home along with his wife, Melissa, 28. The police say they have arrested her former boyfriend, Anthony C. Cattaneo III, 42, in connection to her death. He is being held on $1 million bail, according to the New Haven Register. The police say a small amount of marijuana was found in Cattaneo's home, but they have not charged him with any crime. "We were told she had been beaten, that she was in a terrible state," said Rose Ketunuti. "Nothing like this has been talked about on the news." When the couple decided to tie her up and put her in a burning fire barrel, it appears she did a good job of controlling the flames. The police say an angry and jealous Ketunuti struck her husband, knocking him out, before setting fire to her body. She was found in a basement with the fire already out. Ketunuti had previously been in the hospital for treatment of depression, Rose Ketunuti said, and had been going to counseling. "She was a loving mother," said Ketunuti's sister. "She was a good woman. She had no history of this sort of assault." Rose Ketunuti said when her sister ran into Anthony Cattaneo III on the street Monday afternoon, she told him they had been speaking once a week for the past month. On Monday, she had told him she wanted to see him in person.	0
Even after his debilitating stroke eight years ago, even after all the subsequent public appearances and New Year's Eves when his speech was slurred and his once-impeccable timing seemed to have checked out for eternity, Dick Clark still appeared somehow above and beyond normal physical laws. For decades, we had doubted he would ever grow old. This past December 31, you watched and listened as he counted backwards for yet another year, missing no numbers on the short path to 2012. And you thought to yourself: This man cannot be stopped. Like the promise of the U.S. Postal Service: reliable, no matter what the weather, no matter what time of day, month or decade. For almost 60 years, excluding the one immediately after his 2004 stroke, reliable and unstoppable was what Clark was. That is, until Wednesday, when Clark died at age 82. For those of a certain age, writing those last six words seems so improbable that you're not sure you want to expose them to light. Acknowledging them is like sealing a door to youthful paradise when what's now old and obsolete is forever sexy, frisky and fun. Some of you may find this bewildering. You're likely among those who knew Clark only as somebody your parents and grandparents watched on TV, hovering in a booth over Times Square every New Year's Eve, interrupting some pop music acts to tell people the Ball Was About to Drop on whatever the last calendar year was. As indelible as this gig was, it was only one of many Clark had as game-show host, restaurant-chain proprietor, media mogul and music impresario on "American Bandstand." It was in that latter role that most of us born after World War II cherish him the most. Between 1952 (when he was a frequent substitute for regular host Bob Horn when it was just called "Bandstand") and 1988 (the year before he yielded hosting duties in the show's final year to Dave Hirsch), Clark presided over "American Bandstand," the most enduring and iconic of television programs, on which teenagers danced to popular records and watched pop stars -- from Chuck Berry to Chubby Checker, from Bo Diddley to Bobby Darin, from Jackie Wilson to Annette Funicell -- lip-synch their hits.	1
A fourth suspect has been arrested in the shooting deaths of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children, authorities said late Monday. Police say they have evidence that places Gary Lamont Sumner at the crime scene. Gary Lamont Sumner faces a murder charge for his alleged role in the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on Thursday, Escambia County, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan said. Sumner was pulled over in a traffic stop in Okaloosa County Sunday and arrested after authorities found he matched a description put out by Escambia authorities. Police believe six to eight people were involved in the homicides, which occurred in the couple's home in Beulah, west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line.  Watch surveillance video of the home invasion » The crime was "a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said. Wayne Coldiron, 41; Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, and Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Sr., 56, were arrested over the weekend. Coldiron and the younger Gonzalez face charges of murder, robbery and residential home invasion; the elder Gonzalez faces charges of evidence tampering for allegedly trying to disguise a vehicle spotted at the home. Morgan said at least three others are persons of interests in the investigation. "We expect more arrests to be imminent," Morgan told reporters. Both of the Billingses were shot multiple times, Morgan said, but he would not release further details on their deaths. Authorities released two surveillance tapes taken from the front and rear of the Billingses' home. Each shows a vehicle pulling up to the property, and five people dressed in black and wearing masks entering the home through two entrances -- including through a utility door left unlocked, something Morgan said is not uncommon in the community. Authorities believe drivers remained in both of the cars. Investigators believe one motive in the deaths was robbery, but "we believe there are other motives," Morgan said. He would not say what, if anything, was taken from the home. Melanie Billings' biological daughter, Ashley Markham, told reporters the couple initially had 17 children -- two biological children each for Byrd and Melanie Billings, with the rest adopted. Three have died over the years, she said. The couple had no biological children together.  Watch Ashley Markham say, "Love was never scarce" in Billings home »	1
Turns out the "gotcha" moment in Thursday's New Hampshire debate wasn't so clear cut. Republican Scott Brown, who is vying for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's seat, appeared to botch a question on New Hampshire geography during the final vernacular of the night. The video captured Brown saying, "We have more land mass [in the state] than any other state, not including Alaska." He was immediately cut off by Shaheen, who corrected Brown that New Hampshire covers 30,000 square miles, not just 31,000.But, what's this really a "gotcha" moment? Because this gotcha moment makes Brown look really bad. It makes Shaheen look like a good politician. And it makes the entire system we call a debate system look bad.To make this point, please imagine that you and I were sitting at a dinner. At the moment I ask you a question, I have something which happens to be true and which you know to be true. You know that by my next question I'll be changing my question. And, just by asking the new question, you've given me a new question. If I really like your answer, then I'll go back to the old question.That's what's happening right now with the debate process. If I ask the question which is true, then the media is going to change the question to make it true. And then the moderator will go back and forth. And, what you think I like at first is a lie, then you're going to say the truth. And then I'm going to find out that you like the truth. And now, on top of that, you know full well that the truth or the lie that you like best, or I find out, is not what I want to hear. So, you're in a self-reinforcing loop.Now, in this loop, every time I ask the question I get a correct answer. The next time you say the correct answer, you're going to get the correct answer. So, I'm giving you what you want. And, I'm giving you what you really want, what I want in that debate. What I want to hear is, is this a good debate system?

If the Americans followed the French presidential elections as avidly as the French stare at the poll ratings of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they would know that "Sarko l'Américain," Sarkozy the American, may soon have to say "good bye" to the Elysée Palace. The omens are bad and the possible demise of the most pro-American president in our history raises questions about our long and complex transatlantic relations. How will French election be decided? Not that there is so much to worry about. Sarkozy's potential successor, the Socialist François Hollande, may have said that "the enemy is finance," but he also told the New York Times that before attending l'Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the alma mater of our elite public service, he had traveled to the United States and written a report on the American fast food industry that foresaw the triumph of McDonald's in France a decade later. The candidate even admitted a personal weakness for hamburgers -- a strategic cliché America is welcome to take as a token of transatlantic loyalty. But it is not always enough. Remember Jacques Chirac? Our former president gained real popularity in the U.S. after telling Larry King that in his youth he had worked as a soda jerk at a Howard Johnson hotel, and even dangerously overextended his vacations to date a southern belle who called him "Honey Chile" and drove him around in a white Cadillac convertible. All this sincere devotion to Americana didn't spare him from being reviled later as the commander-in-chief of the "Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys", unwilling to risk blood and treasure in the quest of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Tons of "Freedom Fries," the creative rants of Bill O'Reilly and George W. Bush, even the sad visit to the White House in 2004 of our then ambassador to check officially on the status of France ("Friend or Foe?") are enough proof that our relations can become sour and chaotic overnight. But hateful? No. It's just ... complicated. Colin Powell, the man in the middle in 2004, sincerely thought America and France could form a bona fide couple, be it "in therapy for the last 60 years." And if the first rule of therapy is to verbalize, France has been vocal, to say the least.	1
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius speaks at a news conference in June 2007 in Washington. Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003. She made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business-friendly and increase government efficiency. The Kansas governor has a political pedigree: Her father, John Gilligan, was a Democratic governor of Ohio in the '70s. But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner. Since she moved into the governor's mansion, Newsweek has identified Sebelius as "one to watch." Time named her one of four "rising stars from the heartland," and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors. "Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008," Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans. Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole. But entering her sixth year as governor, Sebelius seems to be everyone's favorite pick to join that select group. The down-to-earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge: She loves NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor. (Sometimes, perhaps, a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election-year debate that Missouri roads scared her more than the World Trade Center attacks.) But the big draw for national Democrats is her skill at appealing to moderate GOP voters -- the only way a Democrat can win major office in Kansas. Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. Bush carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no Democratic presidential contender has won there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.	1
Christina Cimino was logging onto Twitter on Thursday morning when something happened that she found deeply unsettling. iReporter David Seaman says Twitter needs a competitor so users don't panic when it goes down. "I found something so disturbing that I posted it at exactly 9:40 a.m. on Twitter," Seaman wrote. "It was a tweet about an unconfirmed Twitter outage, and my boss and I were both on it. A lot of people were talking about it."David Seaman, CEO of the digital advertising company iReporter, says Twitter is experiencing a Twitter outage this morning but he thinks the company needs a more established competitor."At approximately 9:40 AM EST, my Twitter account started going into a little trouble," Seaman tweeted. "This started as a slow connection issue. After a few minutes, though, a message appeared on my screen that my Twitter feed was down, and a big blue banner saying 'Your Account Has Been Deactivated' appeared on the top of my Twitter feed. When I clicked the link (it looks like the page was redirected to a new URL) to confirm that my Twitter was actually down, it took me to the Twitter support page — where I was given this choice: click here to 'Reactivate Your Account' or click here to 'Change My password.'""The only option I found there was to change my password," Seaman wrote. "I clicked the Change My password link, and was redirected to Twitter's website for the account reset process. I chose to "Reset and Improve my Security' and then was prompted to enter my old password, which I did.""After typing my password, it was sent to Twitter servers for processing," Seaman continued. "It is now sitting in my browser history."Seaman says he immediately sent an inquiry to Twitter asking why the account had been reset and why it had taken days for them to respond."I was not sure what to think, as things had not gone wrong before," he wrote. "I sent another message saying I could not log in at that time. I was quickly told that the 'reset' had happened last week and that any changes I'd made would not be reflected as they were only saved in my password file. I replied asking how long it would take Twitter to respond, as it appears this was an account that had been inactive for some time."	0
The future of transport is self-driving cars, says GPS inventor Bradford Parkinson. The famed inventor, military hero and former boy scout, told CNN that advances in the use of GPS mean that the technology could not only emerge in the next few years, but is already being road tested by companies such as Google. "I think (the future) leads to robotic cars. I think there will come a time when you go down the highway and you don't have to have your hand on the steering wheel at all. It'll be a combination of GPS, radar and other sensors." If there is anyone who should know about the future of GPS, it is Brad Parkinson. The former air force colonel was an integral member of the team that invented GPS technology. While he is now a professor emeritus at Stanford University in California, in the 1980s Parkinson headed up the GPS program run by the U.S. military. "When I invented the system I was a United States colonel," says Parkinson. "I was in the air force and had a PhD in aeronautics from Stanford, and a master's degree from MIT. I'd been testing inertial navigation systems for three years in my past and I had taken digital controls at MIT." The development of GPS was the product of a military program called 621B. Parkinson had the idea that satellites could be used to help find and track targets to make weapon deployment more accurate. "I had flown combat, I understood the value of precision weapon delivery, I understood that it would be a humane use of a bomb if you could hit what you want to hit and not hit a mosque, hospital or school." Initially, the military was resistant to the idea, says Parkinson. "The air force didn't want it because first of all they thought we couldn't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways. And their old ways were, in essence, carpet bombing, it was very sad." Fortunately Parkinson found some powerful allies who helped drive the program forward. At a critical moment in the fledgling technology's development, Malcolm Currie, a physicist and U.S. Navy officer, introduced Parkinson to General Kenneth Shultz, whose personal interest in the program kept the research of GPS alive.	1
A top international Red Cross official will be meeting with Syrian leaders over the next two days to discuss "urgent humanitarian challenges" in the conflict-wracked nation and permission to visit detainees amid stark reports of prisoner abuse. Jakob Kellenberger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, was to arrive in Damascus on Saturday for a two-day visit, the ICRC said. He will meet with President Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister Adel Safar, Walid Muallem, the minister of foreign affairs and expatriates, and the Syrian Red Crescent, the ICRC said. This comes as Syria remains engulfed in nearly six months of public protest, and the regime has been reviled internationally for its crackdown on peaceful demonstrators, which has led to more than 2,000 deaths and thousands of arrests. When Kellenberger visited Syrian officials in June, he reached an understanding that would give the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent "enhanced access to areas of unrest, and negotiations would take place concerning ICRC visits to detainees." "The purpose of the talks to be held in the Syrian capital today and tomorrow is to review progress made in both these areas," the ICRC said. "The ICRC president's visit will also offer an opportunity to discuss the impending start of ICRC visits to persons detained by the Ministry of the Interior. The ICRC visits detainees in order to assess the conditions in which they are being held and the treatment they receive." This visit comes on the heels of an Amnesty International report detailing the deaths of at least 88 people in detention and widespread abuse of prisoners. Another issue to be addressed is access to medical care for the sick and wounded. There have been reports of people not being able to access medical care during security operations. Elsewhere in Syria, two people were killed on Saturday in Habash, a village in northwestern Idlib province, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group. This occurred as security and military personnel stormed the city in search of wanted militants, the group said. The latest international pressure on the Syrian regime was Friday, when the European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and added four more Syrians and three entities to a list of those targeted by an asset freeze and a travel ban. Russia's foreign minister slammed the EU sanctions against Syria, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported Saturday.	1
Michael Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for a powerful sedative despite knowing its harmful effects, a nutritionist who worked with the singer said Tuesday. Cherilyn Lee is a holisitic health ian said to have treated Jackson, who died last month at age 50 because of drug and alcohol problems, when he was trying to cope with the stress of his life and his troubled personal life.After getting to know his new colleagues, I was very impressed with the passion on display. I think this is an attitude that is desperately needed.They are doing a great job and it's important that they are given every opportunity to succeed.But he did not want to run for office, to which I was puzzled."I think he might be interested in being a judge someday and ruling people from the bench", he added.If the Trump administration is unable to prove a specific virus caused the outbreak and there is no vaccine, the White House could still make its case that public health officials acted prematurely in not requiring more stringent masks and other precautions.It is a bit of a double-edged sword. If I don't do that or if I do do that in an unsupportive environment, I'm not going to be able to help my team, much less them.But it's going to be very, very interesting, as it relates to who the president is and who he surrounds himself with.

Fans of the "Magic Mike" franchise got a hump day treat with a trailer for sequel "Magic Mike XXL" dropping on Wednesday. The icky teaser video offers some tantalizing hints about the coming female-centric sequel, but in the end, the reveal remains nothing more than a tease of "more to come."The trailer opens with a man, presumably Mike (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), being kicked out of his girlfriend's hotel room after she tries to seduce him. Then, it flashes to the title card for "Magic Mike XXL," a film that has nothing to do with Mike's previous films, and a shot of the title card reads, "Welcome to Magic Mike XXL." The clip ends with a close-up of a woman's face, with director James Mangold declaring, "You've just seen [the trailer].""Mike XXL" stars Gordon-Levitt, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Upton, Michelle Williams and Sarah Jessica Parker. Mangold also stars in the film, playing a man who was once known as "The Magician" (see: the original "Magic Mike").The trailer was enough to get a bunch of female fans excited about the upcoming sequel. "I've been reading about this for weeks and now it's here in glorious 1080p HD. Is she wearing the same dress? We've got a better idea. They even made my dress better," tweeted one person. "OMG I'm excited. I have been reading all the stuff since December. Thank you @sjsworldwide #MAGIC_MIXxxL! #magicmike," wrote a fan."Thanks for the trailer and all the love. I'm looking forward to the film," agreed another user. "Please, please keep it together & give as much as we can. @jamesmangold @sjsworldwide #MAGIC_MIXxxL," someone else posted. And a third person added, "I love you for this trailer. I'm very excited to see what happens.""You better stay alive and not miss this," tweeted someone else.

Limited runway space and battered telecommunications networks are hindering efforts to get food, water and medical aid into the hands of desperate Haitians amid the devastation of last week's earthquake, relief  agency spokesman Michael Corwin says.With the earthquake bringing down buildings, including many schools, and leaving a trail of rubble in its wake, people are also struggling to get to the few medical clinics in the capital.US President Barack Obama said on Monday he had given his approval for US cargo planes to fly food, water and medical supplies into Haiti, as well as medical supplies to other disaster zones.Obama said it is up to the countries of origin to decide whether they want to deliver supplies to Haiti.Corwin said it will be impossible to get enough food and water into Haiti before the rainy season begins, which begins on November 15.There are also reports of people trapped in collapsed or damaged buildings."The country is not prepared for the rainy season," Corwin said.Food aidObama said planes could transport food, water and medical supplies to areas that do not have access to roads."We are using the full array of our international partners in order to help the Haitians to recover from this challenge," he said.While Corwin said he did not know if Obama's proposal would speed deliveries of supplies, he said it was possible.The US Embassy officials in Port-au-Prince are preparing to ship the food and medical aid to Haiti.The embassy officials also sent two new trucks to Port-au-Prince to accommodate the shipment, according to Corwin.He said the embassy officials in Port-au-Prince have shipped 70 trucks of water and food to the capital so far."The ambassador has given approval of the cargo that is supposed to be coming to Haiti. If not here, it's supposed to be going to the US Embassy there," Corwin said.Corwin said there has been a big increase in the traffic on the highways in the city."They have lots of cars waiting to fill up, and are also waiting to take water to the people," he said.The US also has a cargo plane coming to the island.The plane is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday, Corwin said.The plane will fly the food, water and medicine to Port-au-Prince,	0
Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was admitted Sunday to a military hospital in Sanaa, the second time that he's been to a hospital this month, a government official said. Saleh led Yemen Saleh, the country's president, is in a critical condition and on life support after multiple organ failure and complications due to diabetes, said Saleh's brother, General Ali Salem Saleh."The president is on life support," he said, adding that he had requested that the hospital in Sanaa call off an operation, which would have involved operating on his brain. "As of yesterday, he is still in a critical situation."A Yemeni official said he had not heard of Saleh's heart problems. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation.An Associated Press reporter in Sanaa heard Saleh speaking to doctors in the hospital.In a video clip posted online Sunday, Saleh said he would not give up power without a fight.Saleh, 70, was speaking in Arabic to cheering supporters, according to video posted on the Web site of the state-run Yemen TV.On a recent visit to the hospital, Saleh said he was feeling good. "I have been feeling better for three days. I am now stable," he said, according to the video.He was released from a hospital in Sanaa in May 2012 after having undergone three hospital admissions for heart and liver problems.His third and most recent hospitalization occurred on Friday.The Yemeni government spokesman, Yahia Mohsen, said Saleh's condition had gone into a "serious" deterioration over the last month.Mohsen said Saleh had also been hospitalized for a kidney infection."There were no major complications during his hospitalization," Mohsen said.He described Saleh as in bad condition, with his blood pressure and blood sugar still dropping. "The president is not conscious."The government spokesman said Saleh had suffered heart attacks in the past.Mohsen said Saleh's condition was deteriorating "because his blood pressure was still falling." He said Saleh's health had been worse during his last hospitalization in March.Saleh, a close Saudi ally, was elected president in 2011 and ruled Yemen from 1984 to 2012.Saleh had been in an internal power	0
Could England be the team which comes from nowhere to win the European Championship finals in 2016? No, probably not. But this 2-0 win over Switzerland should not be scoffed at, especially by those who would have considered England escaping  all chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.The result is hardly a surprise (if it wasn’t for their two goals in the first half, it would have been a much more convincing victory), but the manner of the win is another matter entirely. The manner of a defeat. In fact, England may have been the best team against Switzerland that we’ve seen this whole tournament so far. The Swiss, despite a slow start, were in the ascendancy by the time the final whistle blew, and it was a question of when and not if England secured the points.“I’ve been telling people,” said Wayne Rooney as he watched the match in the press box, “that we’ve beaten all the big teams here, but the big teams don’t always beat the rest of us.” Let’s just say he has a point.This result would have had a much more substantial bearing on England’s chances had the referee not been so obtuse. England were on the back foot for long periods of the game, and could have easily lost and been out of the competition altogether.If England lose to Switzerland again, it looks likely that they will not go to the next round. Their form has shown us that it might not matter anyway, but it is a real shame that they were so inept in the opening two games, making it likely that this would have been a much more convincing result.The win leaves a disappointing feeling after a disappointing first half which featured three own goals, two penalties and six clearances against. The second half was a much better affair, despite a couple of mistakes, including a sloppy clearance from Phil Jones that led to a goal for the Switzerland. As for England, there were plenty of positives.As mentioned above, Rooney had a great game as captain – his pass to Theo Walcott on the right wing proved to be a real touch of genius – and he is starting to look like he is going to be a real star, especially as the competition is still very young:It was a great win for England against a Swiss side who are not the strongest	0
Two more arrests were made in connection with the shooting death of a Mississippi State University student on campus, bringing the total number of suspects to three, officials said Tuesday. All three suspects are from the Jackson, Mississippi, metro area, and they are believed to be acquaintances of the victim, who is from Madison, Mississippi, said university Police Chief Georgia Lindley. All three suspects are facing a charge of capital murder with the intent to sell a controlled substance, Lindley said. Trent Deundra Crump turned himself in to authorities of Alachua County Sheriff's Department in Gainesville, Florida, Lindley said. Duntae Harvey, 21, was arrested Monday and was being transferred Tuesday from Rankin County, where he has been held, university officials said. Mason Perry Jones, 21, of Jackson was arrested Monday in Memphis by members of the U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force, Lindley said. The victim, John Sanderson, 21, was found dead in Evans Hall, a dormitory for male students. The shooting took place place at 10 p.m. Saturday. The suspects were apparently selling drugs and drugs were found at the scene of the shooting, Lindley told CNN affiliate WREG. The shooting prompted the school to send a campus-wide alert through a series of text messages. CNN's Joe Sutton and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.	1
Residents of Kano in Nigeria are struggling to keep alive their centuries-old tradition of hand-dying delicate cloth a deep indigo blue, with their trade under threat from the realities of modern commerce. Kano's pits are said to date back 500 years and were once the center of a bustling Saharan trade in dyed cloth. There are still over 120 pits in Kano but only 30 of them are functioning. Many of them have been filled in, often because families have moved on to other businesses, but sometimes because they're waiting for their children to grown up, dig out the pit and reclaim their tradition. Sixty-five-year-old Yusuf Abdu has worked in the dye pits since he was a boy. The pits are family owned and Abdu has trained his 21-year-old son to continue the tradition, but such dedication is rare. "A lot of our elders have died, so we are calling our families to come back and embrace the work again," said Abdu, who is hoping his son will pass on the knowledge to another generation. Indigo, potassium and ash are mixed with water in the pits, and then the cloth soaked for up to six hours. The longer it's soaked, the deeper the color. "We are using the same ways dyers used when the pits began in 1498," explained Abdu. "We cannot use modern methods because that will change our tradition." Methods of ironing the cloth are just as traditional; material is beaten with a mallet to remove creases. But these ancient production lines are now being hammered by competition from cheaper foreign fabrics and the rising costs of energy and materials at home. "There have been a lot of changes. Materials that once cost $10 now cost $40," said Abdu. Despite its rich history, regional demand for the dyed wares has fallen as fashions have changed, so the dyers are looking to tourists as potential buyers. Abdu hopes that with their custom the dye trade will continue, as it has for centuries, and that one day his son will be passing on the traditional techniques to his grandson.	1
A flight from Chicago to Shanghai suffered an apparent bird strike after takeoff and landed safely back at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Sunday. American Airlines Flight 289 took  off from O'Hare at 8:19 p.m. EST (1419 GMT) Sunday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. The Boeing 737-800 departed Chicago's Midway International Airport shortly after 1:40 a.m. EST (1100 GMT) Sunday. According to American Airlines, the first officer reported a bird strike on the plane's right wing before the plane reached cruising altitude at 8,600 meters (29,700 feet). As the plane descended toward the ground at 12,950 meters (40,000 feet), the aircraft’s right wing collapsed, the airline said.The aircraft landed safely with no significant injuries, the airline said.It wasn't immediately clear what brought the plane into trouble.Related:Aeronautical Engineer: Birds strike aircraft more often than you thinkAeronautical Engineer: Birds strike aircraft more often than you thinkA bird strike isn't the only thing that could've caused the accident, according to aviation expert David Borenstein. The airline said that the plane was equipped with a "defect detection system," which "assesses structural damage and evaluates the potential for a bird strike."In this case, the bird strike triggered a fault in the plane."This is a rare but serious type of bird strike where the bird strikes the wing and it activates a defect detection system in the wing," Borenstein said. "The defect detection system sends data to the computer on board the aircraft."Related:Bird strike causes Chicago flight to return to the gateBird strike causes Chicago flight to return to the gateIf this isn't a case of bird strike, how did a bird strike crash the airplane? "The only thing you could be seeing is mechanical failure," Borenstein said. "The bird strike could have damaged the plane, but it would have been far more likely for a bird strike to have caused a problem in the plane that resulted in the flight return to the gate."At this point, we'll have to wait for the results of the investigation."That is a very rare bird strike — it's very rare but it does happen," Borenstein said.	0
At least 800 people have been killed in a key Syrian city over the past 40 days, a Syrian monitoring group said Sunday. Most of those killed were ISIS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters, battling for control of Kobani, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitoring group based in London broke down the casualty figures starting September 16, the day ISIS began its attack on the Syrian Kurdish enclave. More than half of the 815 people killed -- 481 -- were fighters with ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, the Syrian Observatory said in a statement. They were killed in ambushes and suicide car bombings as well as in attacks led by a Kurdish female commander, the group said. The group said 302 Syrian Kurdish fighters were also killed. Two civilians beheaded Civilians accounted for 21 of the dead; two of them were beheaded, according to the statement. The real death toll could be a lot higher. The group said it believes the actual casualty figure is twice the number documented, "because there is absolute secrecy on casualties and due to the difficulty of access to many areas and villages that have witnessed violent clashes and bombardment by the two sides." Video from Kobani on Sunday showed a plume of smoke rising above the city, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab. Most of the city's 200,000 people have fled across the border into neighboring Turkey. New York Times: ISIS hostages were tortured before beheadings U.S. military strikes Word of the casualties comes as U.S. military forces continue to strike ISIS targets in Syria.

Republican Joni Ernst has won the race for Iowa's U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, defeating Democratic challenger Bruce Braley, according to a CNN projection. The win in the Hawkeye State, which voted for xtremely conservative Republican Donald Trump in the presidential election, ends a months-long battle between the two."We came up here to win, and we did that," Ernst told reporters at a victory party on Monday night. "And the people of Iowa decided what their issues were going to be, and that's what we've done here."Ernst's win came despite an earlier poll by Public Policy Polling showing she led Braley, 50.6 percent to 46.3 percent. But the two are now headed to May's May 25 deadline to agree on the location of the next round of their runoff election. That would be their seventh in as many elections.Ernst had promised "a lot more change" in her campaign and vowed to serve the people of Iowa more like a U.S. Senator than a state senator.The two campaigns sparred over Trump in particular. Braley accused Ernst of being "Trump's puppet" and said that in the final days leading up to the election, she "wrestled in the caucus room" with the president.However, Braley's campaign has now entered into agreement with GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds to host the new district GOP caucus, which could be held on May 10. It would be the first district caucus for Republicans since 2006, but Braley refused to concede the race until the Iowa GOP officially certified the results.The Iowa GOP announced last week it would host a GOP caucus, which could be held on May 3, instead of taking the option of holding a mail-in ballot caucus.Bruce Braley and Joni Ernst.Ernst took the stage shortly after Braley and pledged to work "tirelessly" toward the GOP caucus."It's going to be an exciting evening," she said. "It's going to be a night of celebration for the voters. I'm going to get back to you all as soon as I've gone through with the details of this race."The Iowa Republican Party canceled its planned June 2 caucus, and Ernst's win was certified by the secretary of state's office last week.	0
A Palestinian diplomat and his wife were injured in an attack in the West Bank city of Bethlehem on Thursday, Palestinian officials said.Police arrived at the scene of the attack, with a Palestinian spokesman saying it involved a car being driven into a crowd of people. The driver of the vehicle was killed in the attack, the spokesman said.Israeli police denied that claim and said no Israeli forces are involved.The attack, which came just one day after a bomb blast detonated in the West Bank killed two Israeli civilians, also left two Palestinian civilians injured, Palestinian sources said.No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.The Palestinian ambassador to London, Riyad Mansour, cried for calm and pledged to protect those "enjoying peace," saying those responsible for the attack must be punished, Palestinian sources said.He called on the British government to take action to prevent such attacks in other parts of the world.Palestinian officials said that after Friday prayers and celebrations marking the end of Ramadan, a Palestinian man, aged in his 20s, was shot dead by Israeli forces inBeit Hanoun, close to the Palestinian village of al-Arrub. Israeli media said the man, whose name was not given, diedseveral days after throwing a bomb that wounded two in Beit Hanoun.The explosion, which took place Tuesday evening, occurred in the northern West Bank, not far from the Palestinian Israeli border. Israelis had been working to remove the explosive device left by the Palestinian man who wasreportedly carrying a remote control bomb or an RPG.Israeli troops had previously killed at least three Palestinians in the West Bank in attacks blamed on Hamas or Islamic Jihad militants.Rights group Amnesty International said two other Palestinians were injured in the explosion, in the al-Arrub area, after launching a homemade bomb in the midst of what it described as "a period when Israeli forces are using disproportionate force to maintain seizure of areas of the West Bank."The two injured Palestinians were in serious condition, the human rights group said.The two	0
The revolution, apparently, will not have its own perfume line. Fragrances dedicated to leftist guerrilla fighter Ernesto "Che" Guevara and deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, have been canceled for disrespecting "sacred symbols," according to a government statement published Saturday in the Cuban Communist Party daily Granma. A day after the revolutionary-themed fragrances -- called "Ernesto" and "Hugo" -- were announced, the island's top leadership criticized a Cuban-state company for trying to cash in on the men's images. "Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken for this grave error, " read the statement from the executive committee of the Cuban government Council of Ministers. "Initiatives of this type will never be accepted by the people or the revolutionary government." After fighting along side Fidel Castro in the Cuban revolution, Guevara, a native of Argentina, was killed in 1967 will trying to foment another leftist uprising in Bolivia. Cuban government officials have previously criticized international companies' efforts to capitalize on Guevara's famous visage, which has been used to market everything from rock bands to luxury automobiles. Chavez was a key ally to the Cuban government, supplying the island with millions of barrels of oil and adopting a brand of socialism similar to the Cuban revolution's in his native Venezuela. He died in 2013 from cancer. According to the Cuban government statement, neither of the men's families approved the use of their names for the perfumes.	1
Sid Meier is the director of creative development at Firaxis Games. But to millions, he's better known as the "Father of Computer Gaming." Now, the designer of "Civilization" is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of Facebook. "Civilization" is one of the most popular computer strategy games of all time, and has spawned several versions and updates over the past 20 years. The game allows players to build and develop their own cities, countries and civilizations across the expanse of time. It has sold millions of copies and drawn in fans from around the world who are involved, vocal and loyal. From its beginning in 1991 to its most recent edition, last year's "Civilization V," Meier said it has been a strong, connected community that has kept the game strong. "Players have continued to respond to the game in spite of how far technology has come, in spite of how the world has changed, in spite of how the demographics of game players have changed," Meier said. "Each game starts out in a brand new world (and is) probably going to go off in a different direction than your last game. You've never really exhausted the possibilities of the game." While the game primarily has remained a PC game over the years, Meier took his creation to consoles in 2008 with "Civilization Revolution." The game retained many of the PC version's features, but made them available to a new set of fans -- those who enjoy console and mobile gaming. "We've seen console games getting more strategic, having more depth. It felt like, both in terms of the technology and also where players were, that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console." Fans and critics who enjoyed the fast playability and ease of control warmly received the game. Long-time fans bemoaned the simplicity of the console version, but it won 2008's Best Strategy Game award from the British Academy Video Games Awards. Now, Meier is ready to take to the pages of Facebook with an incarnation of the franchise called "Civilization World." Developers hope to have the game up and running this summer. "It's been the most dramatic stretch for the game, I'd have to say, so far," he said.	1

A Chinese court has sentenced a man to three and a half years in prison for running over a 2-year-old girl and leaving her bleeding in the street, state media reported, a case that stirred debate in China about the level  of protection for the country's growing number of street children.The man, Wang Qi, 38, allegedly went on a drive and came to a park where he hit the girl, her mother and the boy on their way to buy bread. He then drove off without a word, leaving the mother to carry the girl home, his friends told the South China Morning Post.'I was shocked. This is a horrible crime,' the mother of the girl, who was born premature and has cerebral palsy, said when the verdict was announced.'How could he do that without a care for the girl?' she asked.A court in Jinan, the provincial capital of the Shandong province where the incident took place, also ordered the man to pay a fine of 500 yuan ($75).In the wake of the sentencing, Chinese social media users were debating whether street children were less protected than their counterparts in the country's rich coastal economic zones.'Street kids are still considered the weakest among the children because they are not seen as a source of income' said an online post by the state-run tabloid, The Paper, quoting Jinan police, who called the crime 'barbaric.'China has an estimated 2.4 million street children, among them about 800,000 who live outside the official definition of cities, according to a 2014 government survey.Street children, who in China are often trafficked by parents or other relatives or criminals, are considered a 'social problem' by the country's state-run news media which portray them as a burden on the economy.Crowding the streets: Some street children in China are not allowed to sleep indoors, as is common in many cities. Instead they sleep on the road or near busy roads or train tracks, causing them to become even more at risk.Tough on crimes: The number of street children in China almost doubled from 636,000 in 2009 to 1.4 million in 2014.In spite of this, China's government has not only accepted the problem, but also made efforts to help resolve it.In 2009, the government formed an office that deals	0
A Palestinian teenage girl with a knife assaulted an Israeli man Monday in the West Bank, adding another attack to a chain of ethnic violence. At least 10 Israelis have died in attacks since October. A young Palestinian girl was also reportedly killed in ethnic violence. Israeli security officers opened fire on the Palestinian teenager. She sustained "serious injuries," Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The girl was taken to a hospital. The stabbing victim was "lightly wounded" near the cluster of Jewish settlements of Gush Etzion, Israel Defense Forces said. In recent weeks, Palestinian attackers killed and injured Israelis in gun, knife and car attacks. Israeli police have responded by shooting dead most of the alleged assailants. Authorities said Monday they are investigating an incident involving a vehicle that struck an Israeli citizen at the Alon junction on the West Bank. The 50-year-old man is in serious condition in Tel HaShomer Hospital in Tel Aviv. A slew of attacks Here is a look at a few recent acts of violence: • Two Palestinian cousins stormed a Jerusalem synagogue in mid-November with a gun and butcher's knives, killing five. They were shot dead by police. • Days later, Israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by Palestinians to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. • More than a week earlier, attackers stabbed one Israeli soldier to death in Tel Aviv and three more Israelis near a West Bank settlement, the IDF said. One of the West Bank victims also died. • In early November, a Palestinian man driving a van plowed into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern Jerusalem, killing two. Another 12 people were injured. The man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar, police said. • In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. The driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died. • Also in October, according to a Palestinian state news report, an Israeli man killed a 5-year-old Palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from kindergarten. The attack reportedly also injured a second 5-year-old girl. Tensions over the killings of Israeli teens and Palestinian boys marked the run-up to the military conflict  in Gaza between Israel and Hamas this summer, which took dozens of Israeli lives and more than 2,100 Palestinian lives.	1
Tom Cruise's neighbor had a rough night on Sunday. Jason Sullivan, 41, allegedly tried to climb over the actor's fence when a security guard used a "Taser" device to stop him, according to police, who said Sullivan was intoxicated and arrested him on trespassing charges. Police arrived at 9:35 p.m. to find the suspect "attempting to leave the location," Beverly Hills Police Lt. Lincoln Hoshino said on Monday. Sullivan was arrested for trespassing and taken to a hospital by paramedics "for treatment due to the use of the 'Taser' device," he said. "Sullivan lives at an adjacent property and was intoxicated at the time of the incident, and may have confused himself and entered the wrong property," Hoshino said. Cruise and his family were not at home at the time of the incident, he said. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.	1
Prepare a pot of damn fine coffee and enjoy a slice of cherry pie: "Twin Peaks" is coming back. The offbeat TV series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, will be returning to television in 2016, according to a strange (of course) video posted on Showtime's YouTube channel. The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me." "Dear Twitter Friends... it is happening again ... #damngoodcoffee," Lynch tweeted. According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes. Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine. When it debuted, "Twin Peaks" was like nothing else that had ever aired on television. Lynch (then best known as the director of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet") and Frost -- who had written for "Hill Street Blues" -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper, who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world, one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent. The straight-arrow Cooper was fond of a diner's "damn fine coffee" and pie to an almost absurd degree. The show featured a one-armed man, a dancing dwarf, rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named BOB. The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music. In addition to MacLachlan, the show starred Ray Wise, Lara Flynn Boyle, Peggy Lipton and Joan Chen. "Twin Peaks" started off a huge hit, but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker, the audience dwindled, especially in the second season. However, those who stayed with it were a hardcore bunch, enough to prompt the theatrical film so Lynch could tie up some loose ends (or not, being Lynch). Despite diverse reviews, the show remains one of the most influential in television history, with its involvement of a noted movie director, its willingness to take audiences to far-out places, its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics. In many ways, it was ahead of its time.	1
Bayern Munich coach Louis Van Gaal has signed a one-year contract extension with the German champions. The Dutchman's current deal was due to expire at the end of the Bundesliga season but the club confirmed on Monday that Van Gaal's ikkebunden, or non-political status, would not prevent him from extending his stay, after which he will become the highest-paid manager in world football, earning a total of €5 million (about £3 million)."It is a very good feeling to extend it by one year," he said. "I'm very happy, and very proud of what we have achieved together. At Bayern Munich, you have an opportunity to develop your profession as well."The former Netherlands manager was given a one-year extension by club president Uli Hoeness, on the basis that Van Gaal was the best manager available and the club could not afford to run the risk of letting him leave. Had the coach opted to leave for a foreign club next summer, Bayern would have had the right to match the deal."We can't allow an outsider, for instance an Englishman, to come in, do the same as Louis, and expect us to do a lot for one or two months," said Hoeness, who has been pushing for a change in the manager's status for some time."Our ambition is for Louis to still manage us. That means that the only way he will go, is if we all agree. It would be the worst thing to change. There is no way we can allow this to happen. He has already proven that he can lead us. His work ethic is the highest in the game. We have a good team. What the fans have seen in the last few weeks is that his team will show on the pitch what they are made of. He can make it a really special team."The former Ajax coach was hired as Bayern's boss in June 2007, having previously worked at AC Milan, Paris St-Germain and Ajax."They are the best footballing players in the world," said Van Gaal, who arrived in Munich as a director of football but who has since held a senior managerial role. "It is a very special opportunity. I am very happy here.""At the start, there was a small part of me that would like to think that this decision was wrong, but then you realise how	0
The United States is vacating an air base in Pakistan at Islamabad's request following a NATO attack that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter told Pakistan's Waqt TV on Monday that the United States  "offered to transfer security to Pakistan of this military base" in the Balochistan province. But the Pakistani military rejected the offer, a U.S. official told CNBC.What does the Trump administration hope to gain by letting the U.S.-Pakistan relationship unravel?The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been at odds since the United States first attacked the country’s military headquarters in October of 2014, which claimed that Pakistan’s military was behind Osama bin Laden’s death. Soon after the U.S.-led assault, a U.S. drone strike targeted and killed a top al Qaeda leader in Pakistan. A few days later, Pakistan responded with its own drone strike that killed more than 100 fighters in an Al-Qaeda training camp near the country’s southwestern city, Quetta. At the time, the Pentagon said the United States targeted the Taliban and al Qaeda leaders because they were responsible for an attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in the country. The attack on the consulate in December of 2012 killed two American diplomats.A month later, two U.S. special operations forces who were helping the Pakistani military were killed in a firefight at a military base in Pakistan. The U.S. has consistently blamed Pakistan for not preventing the attack.At the same time, the U.S. and Pakistan have long had a close relationship due to their similar religious and social backgrounds and common geographical proximity.Now with the Trump administration putting Pakistan on a more negative light, an entire military base worth of U.S. and Pakistani troops could vanish, opening the door to more war between the two countries.On Monday, Pakistan's powerful military spokesman said the army's Balochistan unit was not behind the attack.The attack on the Balochistan provincial capital, Quetta, and the deaths of two American soldiers is a grave matter for Pakistan."We are deeply shocked and saddened at the loss of our fellow soldiers,” Pakistan's Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Talat Masood told the media, according to CNN. “We have no idea who carried out this heinous crime	0
Calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and European security, President Obama announced Friday that NATO will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of Europe and the United States. The agreement, according to the president, followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61-year-old alliance. The system would be "strong enough to cover all NATO European territory and populations, as well as the United States," Obama told reporters in Lisbon, Portugal. The missile defense plan "offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times," the president said. "It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles." Obama addressed reporters during the first day of what he promised would be a "landmark summit" featuring leaders of NATO's 28 member countries, as well as Russia. By the time it wraps Saturday, the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives intending to reinvigorate and redirect NATO 20 years after the end of the Cold War. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Friday that heads of state had agreed to a new mission statement, calling it the alliance's "road map for the next 10 years." Crafting this so-called strategic concept had been a top priority of the meeting, which Rasmussen last month deemed "one of the most important summits in the history of our alliance." "This strategic concept reconfirms the commitment by NATO members to defend one another against attack, and that will never change," Rasmussen said in Lisbon. "But it also modernizes the way NATO does defense in the 21st century." The document, prepared from recommendations made by a panel led by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, sought to build upon NATO's work in Afghanistan to redefine the alliance as a "global" actor that would work with regional partners to combat threats outside Europe. Under the new plan, NATO will bolster its role in counterinsurgency efforts, as well as the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries, according to Rasmussen. The defense alliance will also develop "a standing capability to train local security forces" and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups. Obama added Friday that NATO, under Rasmussen, was also looking at how to deal with threats like improvised explosives and cyber defenses, all serving a commitment that "an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all."	1
Gadget fans eagerly awaiting the next wave of Apple products just got some good news, and some bad news. First, the bad: Based on CEO Tim Cook's comments Tuesday on the company's quarterly earnings call, Apple appears Â to be planning an expansion of their retail presence through their stores in Japan, China, and India. Apple's store in Japan currently features an Apple Store and iTunes Store, and will have another store in China in October, followed by two more stores there in September, as Apple plans to go from two stores in China to three stores in September (one in Shanghai, one in Beijing, and one in Shenzhen).A similar expansion could be in store in India, where there is an Apple Store only about five miles from where I am writing this, and an iPad store very near my office, both of which were recently visited after being the first of their kind. They also have a large store in the Netherlands, and a smaller store in France. There was a recent rumor of Apple's India store being open by the end of November or early December, with an Apple TV store to follow shortly afterwards. Apple currently has no retail stores in India, and we have little info about the Apple Store in Bangalore. If the rumors are true, Apple will be increasing their presence in the world's largest Indian market, where the iPhone's "i" stands for "India" in the company's name.We don't know yet how Apple will be expanding to India, but we do know that they already have opened a store in Japan, so it's not a new market. We do know that they have a store in China, as the Apple Store in Shanghai is located near my office, and is only one or two miles from my place. This means that Apple could be opening a store in two of the world's largest markets, which would be an unprecedented expansion of Apple's retail presence, even if it is not the same in each of the markets.The good news is that the company is also rumored to make an iBookstore in China, and a store in India, to be called the "iAsia". These names would certainly put the Apple Store in those markets at the top of its list of competitors. It is also not clear if such a store will be in a physical location or an "online" location, meaning that it could come either directly online (as is Apple's plan for the Apple TV store	0
The Arizona police officer who slammed into an armed suspect with his patrol car told investigators he thought he was too far to take a shot at the man, so he chose the other option, CNN affiliate KVOA reported Wednesday. Officer Michael _____ said that he believed he was in “an attempt to save a life,” and “didn’t know it was a human being until it was too late."This is what happens when a cop goes off the reservation and becomes an expert in all things gun control. He thinks everyone should be a "terrorist."A group of former law-enforcement officers has slammed President Donald Trump's remarks in a meeting with law enforcement officials in Phoenix and told him to stop pushing his "fearmongering" agenda and "stop pushing false solutions" to confront violent crime.The group of 50 law enforcement officials, who have served in law-enforcement positions throughout the U.S., issued a statement Wednesday saying "fearmongering and political rhetoric is not just divisive, it is ineffective and creates dangerous outcomes."In response to the group's statement, Trump tweeted, "A great American President was assassinated in broad daylight in broad day light. The police were great!"The group is an open letter by former law-enforcement officers, who are asking the president to "stop pushing false solutions" and take a "time out.""We are not opposed to the use of force. However, using the police as a shield to push your failed and unworkable policies and rhetoric undermines your job," they wrote in an open letter addressed to Trump."When we use force, we are often required to justify the use of force, which leads to an almost impossible-to-solve-exercise in finding the right balance between a policy decision and our obligation to protect life and property in the event of a confrontation," they said.Trump's statement came as the deadly weekend violence at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, where at least 22 people were killed, has focused national attention on the use of firearms by police departments, which have been targeted by critics.The incident in Phoenix where the officer involved in that vehicle chase slammed into an armed suspect.

As millions of people enter the job market and business owners struggle to entice consumers, Ryan Taylor may be better positioned than most to weather the economic crisis. Ryan Taylor, right, and client Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men at Taylor's downtown Los Angeles office. Taylor is a custom tailor who brings his showroom to clients' homes and offices. The day before former New Edition artist Johnny Gill left for a U.S. concert tour in March, Taylor sat in the musician's modest condominium taking measurements for a customized shirt and suit that needed to be completed and shipped in a few days. Even on short notice, "Taylor the Tailor," as he is known, delivered on his promise -- and made Gill a loyal and satisfied customer. Taylor says he wants to change the apparel business model by personalizing a customer's needs, instead of having large inventories and high overhead costs that can quickly put someone out of business in a bad economy. His recipe for success: virtually no inventory and prices competitive with brand name department stores. His story in the apparel business began with the word "wardrobe" itself. "I had seen it numerous times and thought, 'Why would a word associated with business suits or casual attire have such a negative prefix?' " He decided to remove the word "war" and create a brand called DROBE that would offer professionals and smaller mom-and-pop boutiques his personalized custom style. But his first foray into the apparel business began and ended about 10 years ago at a trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. He borrowed money to pay for a booth, but like many entrepreneurial designers getting started, Taylor said buyers were not interested in clothing without established brand names. Soon after, Taylor was broke. "When I came home from that show thousands of dollars in the hole, I thought, 'How can I create a better story?' "  Watch Taylor discuss how his business started » Several months later, Taylor was surprised that some of his personal customers were coming back for more shirts because of his attention to size and detail. "I discovered that clothes off the rack fit less than 50 percent of the consumer population," he said, "and that my custom clothes can be generally close to the same price as those on the rack."	1
The Transportation Security Administration said Friday its officers at a Texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the  incident could've gone more smoothly if female agents had had male chauffeurs to help them.   The TSA, which is responsible for the nation's security along the U.S.-Canada border, said in a statement that an airport  security officer working in the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport told a TSA agent she needed to remove the pliers from a nipple ring she was wearing before boarding a plane.   But the officer said she would have allowed the woman to keep the ring if she had had a male chauffeur.   The statement said:  "It is important to note that female agents who are required to work together are trained to work without male employees to ensure that their actions are not perceived as an overzealous effort to enforce the agency rules and regulations."   The TSA said that the ring that had been confiscated had been made of metal and was approximately three quarters of an inch thick and had been used about 4,500 times since 1979.   The agency said it is working with the Dallas Police Department and the TSA to determine whether any charges will be filed against the officer.   In a statement, Dallas police spokesman Officer Bob Conely said, "The Dallas Police Department takes all incidents involving security at the airport very seriously and our investigators are in close contact with the TSA."   In a letter sent to TSA acting administrator John Pistole, the TSA's general counsel, Patricia Gossman, said the TSA takes "all allegations of inappropriate conduct seriously and will fully investigate any complaints to determine if disciplinary action is warranted."   Gossman also said TSA's "officers should always conduct themselves in a manner that is respectful of persons and does not reflect negatively on TSA."   Dallas Police Chief Jesse Serino praised the TSA's response.   "I am thankful for the professionalism and sensitivity shown by TSA officials," he said.   Gossman said the TSA would continue to work with police to determine if the incident merits further investigation.   The incident comes after several TSA screeners at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport resigned last month over allegations they had engaged in a "pattern and practice of sexual harassment."   In January, a TSA officer at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport	0
Pope Benedict XVI had surgery on his right wrist Friday after he broke it in a fall, the Vatican said. Pope Benedict XVI arrives Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Pope Benedict XVI's resignation may have come on a rainy night but it was definitely the result of a lot of praying and hard work, says Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.His resignation has been expected for nearly a week, but he did not resign from the church. The announcement was made from the Vatican via his spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi.The Vatican spokesman said that Pope Benedict's announcement was very simple and that he asked for the prayers of the whole world.There has been speculation about who would succeed Pope Benedict as he has led the church for almost a decade.Archbishop Viganò, a close confidant of the Pope, said that the resignation was "good news" and that it was his first and last wish. He would have preferred if the Pope had resigned a few months earlier.The Pope has been at the forefront of the campaign against child abuse. Archbishop Viganò said that the Pope will be remembered in history as a great protector of the world's youth. He believes that the Pope was a true reformer in the Church.Pope Benedict XVI is the first Pope to resign in the last half of his five year term.He was asked to step down by Pope Benedict XVI in order to spend more time with his sick mother, who was suffering from cancer. It is alleged that many of the allegations on the use of paedophiles in the Catholic church were made by people close to the Pope, rather than the Pope.He made his intentions public on the 8th March.This year has seen an increase in the number of child sex abuse cases at the highest level of the Church. The Catholic Church has denied the allegations that child abuse was organised.His resignation will be effective immediately.Archbishop Viganò said that he did not know the reasons behind the Pope's resignation and he hopes it was not a result of the financial crisis. He believes that the Pope was made a scapegoat."I was never told about his financial problems, what is happening with the financial crisis and the reasons behind," Viganò said."All I know is he is a protector of the world's	0
Three area residents were arrested and charged Wednesday for allegedly operating four Southern California schools for Korean and Chinese students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a "pay-to-stay" scheme. The three educators collected as much as $6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from South Korea and China, said federal prosecutors. The arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, money laundering and other immigration offenses. An allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme, authorities said. Hee Sun Shim, 51, of Beverly Hills, is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud, authorities said. The two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense: They are Hyung Chan Moon, also known as Steve Moon, 39, of Los Angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools; and Eun Young Choi, also known as Jamie Choi, 32, of Los Angeles, a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school. Shim, who also went by Leonard Shim and Leo Shim, is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence, as well as two counts of money laundering, prosecutors said. The three defendants and their attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. "Immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules," Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Yonekura said in a statement. "In this case, officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country. This type of fraud against the United States will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system," the federal prosecutor said. Three of the schools are in Los Angeles' Koreatown neighborhood: Prodee University/Neo-America Language School; Walter Jay M.D. Institute, an Educational Center (WJMD); and the American College of Forensic Studies (ACFS), authorities said. The fourth school is currently operating in Alhambra, California: Likie Fashion and Technology College, authorities said.	1
More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste.

Tennis ace Serena Williams clarified Wednesday the controversial comments she made in a magazine article about the victim's role in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case that garnered national headlines earlier this year. In March, two high school football players were convicted of raping a drunk teen at a party and posting pictures of the incident online. In an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Williams talks about the convicted rapists after a news report about the case appeared on a nearby TV screen during the interview. "Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know. I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk like that, your parents should teach you: Don't take drinks from other people," she told Rolling Stone. Of the victim, Williams also says in the interview: "She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously, I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different." The comments, posted on Rolling Stone's website Tuesday, immediately caused a firestorm on social media, particularly on Twitter where users castigated the tennis star. On Wednesday, Williams released a statement on her website clarifying her remarks. "What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved -- that of the rape victim and of the accused," she wrote. "I am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article. What was written -- what I supposedly said -- is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame," Williams added. Stephen Rodrick, who wrote the Rolling Stone article, stands by his reporting, telling the Poynter Institute: "The interview is on tape. Other than that, I'll let the story speak for itself."	1
A Russian jetliner crashed on landing in the city of Kazan, killing all 50 aboard, authorities there reported Sunday. Tatarstan Airlines flight 363 carried 44 passengers and a crew of six, Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Irina Rossius said. There were no survivors. The dead included Lt. Gen. Alexander Antonov, the regional chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, and Irek Minnikhanov, the son of Tatarstan regional President Rustam Minnikhanov, Russia's state news service RIA Novosti reported. A British national was also among those killed, the UK foreign ministry said. The Boeing 737 took off from Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport, about 700 kilometers (450 miles) west of Kazan, Rossius said. There was no immediate indication of the cause of the crash, which occurred about 7:25 p.m., the ministry said. Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee has launched an investigation, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are assisting. Boeing said it "extends its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished." The jet was 23 years old and had been in service with at least eight airlines, including Air France, Uganda Airlines and Bulgaria Air, according to aviation industry websites. In a November 2012 flight, it was forced to cut short a flight to Moscow and return to Kazan after losing cabin pressure, according to the website AeroInside. Russia has tried to improve its checkered reputation for air safety in recent years. In 2011, then-President Dmitry Medvedev grounded two classes of Soviet-era aircraft after a pair of crashes that killed more than 90 people, including a charter plane crash that killed an entire professional hockey team. Medvedev said Russia would have to upgrade its aircraft fleet, step up safety standards and radically cut the number of airlines. 4 die in Bahamas plane crash Plane crashes in Bolivia, killing 8 Southwest Airlines pilot tells passengers "We're going down"	1
A judge this week sentenced a former TSA agent to six months in jail for secretly videotaping a female co-worker while she was in the bathroom, prosecutors said. During the investigation, detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department in Tennessee also found that the agent, 33-year-old Daniel Boykin, entered the woman's home multiple times, where he took videos, photos and other data. Police found more than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer. The victim filed a complaint after seeing images of herself on his phone last year. Boykin plead guilty to unlawful photography, aggravated burglary and violation of the computer act, the Nashville District Attorney's Office said. Police said the incident happened in a TSA-only restroom, and that there was no evidence public restrooms were targeted. A TSA official tells CNN that Boykin worked in an administrative capacity and didn't engage in public security screening. Assistant District Attorney Amy Hunter said this case was one of the worst invasion of privacy cases she's seen. "We are thankful that the sentence includes periodic confinement so that the sentence will hopefully make an impression on this defendant and others," Hunter said in a statement. The judge, Randall Wyatt, on Friday called the invasion of privacy "egregious." His sentence also includes five and a half years of probation, which will include GPS monitoring. Boykin was terminated last year when the investigation began. "TSA holds its employees to the highest ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace," TSA's Ross Feinstein said in a statement.	1
Cleveland police have slammed Cleveland Browns player Andrew Hawkins for wearing a T-shirt calling for justice in the police shooting of Tamir Rice during a warm-up before Sunday's NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Browns receiver's shirt read "Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford III" when he walked out onto the field before the game. Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August. Jeffrey Follmer, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, criticized Hawkins' on-field protest. "It's pretty pathetic when athletes think they know the law.  They should stick to what they do best on the field," Follmer told CNN in a statement. "The Cleveland Police protect and serve Browns stadium," he said. "The Browns organization owes us an apology." Medical examiners ruled Friday that Tamir's death was a homicide. Authorities said the officer who shot him mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm. Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said. A witness called 911 to say that a black male -- "probably a juvenile" -- was pointing "a pistol" at people but added twice that the gun was "probably" fake. Two officers arrived in a police car. Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police said. Police have said that Loehmann opened fire after Tamir reached for the gun in his waistband and that an orange tip indicating the gun was a toy had been removed. Follmer described the shooting of a 12-year-old as "unfortunate." "But the facts are, that he appeared to be a 20-year-old male. In the eyes of a Cleveland police officer his physical appearance exceeded Andrew Hawkins' profile," Follmer said. He noted that the Browns player was 5 feet 7 inches and weighed 170 pounds, compared to Tamir's 5 feet 7 inches and 195 pounds. The Cleveland Browns' vice president of communications, Peter John-Baptiste, said the NFL team has "great respect" for the work of the Cleveland police.	1
Thousands of women demonstrated Monday in front of Yemen's foreign ministry in the capital, Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation, residents and eyewitnesses said. The protest comes a day after the first woman was killed in a demonstration against the government, according to opposition activists. The women called for sanctions against President Ali Abdullah Saleh and asked that he be tried by the International Criminal Court. They also alleged that snipers were on the rooftop of the foreign ministry Sunday. The protests came hours after gunfire and loud explosions reverberated throughout the capital early Monday. Medics in Change Square said at least four people were killed and another 26 injured after government forces raided parts of the capital. Another eight people died and 20 were injured in government raids on civilian property, said Abdulqawi al-Qaisi, a prominent opposition leader and head of the Sadeq Ahmar media office. "The death toll is expected to rise as a number of the injured are in critical condition," he said. According to eyewitnesses, government security forces clashed with tribesmen loyal to Hashid tribal leader Sadeq Al-Ahmar in the Hasabah neighborhood in northern Sanaa. Government forces attacked the tribal leader's family residences, al-Qaisi said. "The government attacks against innocent civilians and the Ahmar family continued for hours and hundreds of explosions were heard throughout the morning, causing fear throughout the capital," he said. Residents and witnesses also reported that the Republican Guard was bombarding the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division, loyal to Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who withdrew his support for Saleh in March. The embattled Saleh said Sunday that "strong documentation of the cooperation" between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood indicate a military coup that is destabilizing the country. He described the opposition as "insane people, who can't sleep and only want to take power." "The international community must stop Saleh from killing his own people," al-Qaisi said Monday. "If no intervention takes place, he will continue killing and the casualties will rise." On Sunday night, three people died in Sanaa when a rocket-propelled grenade hit bystanders, medics said. Earlier Sunday, Yemeni security forces opened fired on demonstrators gathering for a planned march in the capital, killing five people and injuring 54 others, according to a medic on the scene.	1
Tablets, laptops, e-readers, smartphones. They keep us plugged in everywhere we go, except when we're on a plane. Many travelers don't believe there is anything wrong with leaving their personal electronic devices on while in flight, but it's a no-no during takeoffs and landings. In August, the Federal Aviation Administration announced plans for a working group that would study the issue of portable electronics on flights and make suggestions for changes. The committee is due to report its findings this summer. Advocates say it's time for a change. "It certainly appears that using an electronic device to read a magazine, to read a newspaper is not a safety factor," said John Walls, vice president of public affairs for CTIA-The Wireless Association. Harlem shake reaches new heights; FAA not amused Using personal electronic devices below 10,000 feet is banned on most airlines. Electronic health devices such as hearing aids and pacemakers are allowed at all times. Anyone who flies could tell you how often the rule is ignored, but it's announced before every flight. While many airlines now offer Wi-Fi access via portable electronic devices from laptops to smartphones, cellular voice and data services on domestic airlines fall under that Federal Communications Commission ban. There hasn't been any conclusive proof that devices such as tablets and e-readers are a danger, but a study released in 2011 found 75 instances of interference that may have been related to personal electronic devices, However, it is difficult to verify pilots' suspicions because of the difficulty replicating incidents. The FAA has said it does not know of any aviation accidents linked to interference from personal electronic devices. Flight attendants say it's a matter of getting your attention during the most sensitive parts of the flight. "If someone is listening to their music or they're watching a video, and they've got their beats on or their noise-canceling headphones, we want to make sure that, if there is a situation that passengers need to hear and understand, that they will be able to do so," said Veda Shook, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. The National Association of Airline Passengers agrees that unplugging for a few minutes is a small price to pay for safety. "So we do not as passengers want to do anything that will interfere or distract the pilots at this critical time of the flight," said Douglas Kidd, the organization's executive director.	1
Even if I could physically do it ... I wouldn't want to go onto another Games because this has been as good as it can get at an Olympics," says Chris Hoy, Britain's champion cyclist. The 36-year-old Scot, who picked up two gold medals at London 2012, says the home support has been incredible and couldn't be replicated in Rio. "The only thing I'd like to continue on to is the Commonwealth Games in two year's time because that will be another home Games in Glasgow and the perfect way to end my career," he said. Hoy completed his Olympic odyssey with victory in the Keirin on the final day of competition in the velodrome last Tuesday -- a win which preceded an emotional medal ceremony. "The night before I was watching Felix Sanchez get his medal in the 400m hurdles. I've never met the guy, but just seeing the raw emotion, the sheer delight and release ... I was welling up myself. So I think I knew when I got up there (on the podium) that it was going to be emotional moment for me," Hoy told CNN. Cycling's glamor girl Pendleton ponders next career move Hoy's tally of six gold medals sees him become Britain's most decorated Olympian, overhauling rower Steve Redgrave's total of five. Since the competition finished in the velodrome, Hoy, the fastest man on two wheels, has had the chance to watch the fastest man on two legs, Usain Bolt. "I was fortunate enough to see him in action (in the 200m final). I've seen him many times before on TV, but you never get an idea of just how impressive the performances are until you see them live," Hoy said. Bolt, he says, is the face of the Games and an Olympic icon, but the Olympics isn't about just one person. "It's about stories, individual stories -- whether it's defeat or success. Human stories, that's what makes the Games special," Hoy said. "It's as much about these emotional moments as they are about the gold medal-winning athletes."	1
It has been nearly eight years since U.S. forces overthrew the Taliban leaders of Afghanistan, but the war against the Taliban insurgency is bloodier than ever. A U.S. soldier takes his position near a building attacked by the  Taliban. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)The Afghan war is a quagmire, and the United States has been losing in it for some time. The government of Afghanistan is an elected body of three former mujahedeen commanders, one of whom is on the U.S.-led coalition death list. When it is over in 2014, the United States will have lost more than a million men in combat, 2,500 civilian contractors, and some 3 million civilians.This is going to be the most expensive war in American history, and probably in the history of Western civilization. The United States is going to lose roughly $1 trillion (around $18 trillion in U.S. dollars). The cost of the war is going to increase by another $1 trillion through 2016, the final year of the planned 20-year mission in Afghanistan. As a matter of fact, the Afghan war will cost the United States more than Afghanistan even when it is over.The United States is already facing multiple challenges from within the United States itself, and it is going to take a lot of resources to continue the “War on Terrorism”. The war against the Taliban in Afghanistan is one of the two most serious challenges facing the United States. The other challenge is climate change.The Afghan war is a quagmire, and the United States has been losing in it for some timeBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Afghan war was the most expensive war in U.S. military history with a total cost of around $100 billion. Under the United States’ “War on Terrorism”, the number has jumped to $500 billion, which is more than double the war’s total amount.Since the war began in October 2001, the United States has lost approximately 10,000 lives, a number that continues to increase. The war has cost $40 billion per week in direct troop costs for 2011, and over $70 billion per week in indirect costs. This means that the U.S. government lost over $350 billion per year in Afghanistan as of 2007.The war has been going on for over a decade, and it is not going	0
Bridget Cutler was still adjusting to being a new mom when she read a magazine article that changed her life. "It was about a mother who decided to give her child up for adoption because she couldn't stand to hear her crying from hunger," Cutler remembered. "I just thought that no mother should ever be faced with that choice." It can cost close to $250,000 to raise a child in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- and that is just for the basics. It's especially tough for families in New Jersey, where one in eight people struggle to make ends meet. The following day, Cutler called her "mom friends" and started collecting gently used baby items. "I had the intention, originally, of finding a local organization to donate them to that would benefit my neighbors," said Cutler, 34. When she did not find what she was looking for, Cutler's idea for Moms Helping Moms was born. Since 2011, the nonprofit has distributed diapers, clothing, nursing supplies and other baby essentials for hundreds of infants and toddlers in New Jersey. "So many people have such an abundance, and so many others strive to afford even the basics," Cutler said. "What we're doing is trying to bridge that gap." A fair start in life Moms Helping Moms started with one garage sale that Cutler held at her home -- except everything was free. The drive was a success, and she met many mothers in need and many mothers who wanted to help her build the organization. Today, Cutler and her volunteers solicit donations of new or gently used baby items in their neighborhoods. Cutler knows that it can be difficult for some parents to part with their children's things. "I wanted to assure these people who were donating so generously to us that these things were absolutely going into hands that needed them," she said. Cutler finds recipients through social workers and other nonprofits. She works with homeless mothers, teen moms and families who have fallen on hard times and just need a boost. Jasmine Harding suffered complications during her last pregnancy. The mother of three was out of work for nearly 10 months, and she and her partner struggled to afford everything they needed. "I never thought that I would be in this position. I've had a job since I was 16," Harding said.  "I'm their mom, and I should be able to do whatever it is that I need to do for them."	1
Gasps punctured the air inside Boston Symphony Hall after the conductor interrupted the afternoon performance to announce to the 2,500 people in the audience that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Listening to the moment, which was captured on an audio recording, the emotions are still powerful 50 years later. The weekly Friday concert had started at 2 p.m. "just like normal," recalled Joseph Silverstein, then a 29-year-old violinist in his first year as the concertmaster for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. No one in the concert hall knew that, as they took their seats for the performance, their president had been fatally shot in Dallas. Thirty minutes in, the orchestra broke for a 15-minute intermission. And that, Silverstein recalled, is when this very normal day was shattered. During the intermission, Silverstein remembers huddling around the 24-inch TV in the basement, watching in horror along with 100 other musicians as Walter Cronkite delivered the news of the assassination. There was no time to react. "I was just trying to grasp the reality of it," Silverstein said, adding that he has never publicly shared his memories from that terrible day until now. "We were stunned." The orchestra had to go upstairs to an audience that remained blissfully unaware of the events in Dallas. As the group walked to the concert hall, several orchestra members openly wept, but Silverstein says they still managed to take their seats. The orchestra's music director, Erich Leinsdorf, was going to have to break the news to the audience. Silverstein says the legendary music director was nervous, but his Austrian-tinged English was slow and deliberate while making the announcement, as if delivering the 46 words was just as painful as the initial shock of the president's death. "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a press report over the wires. We hope that it is unconfirmed, but we have to doubt it," Leinsdorf told the audience. "The president of the United States has been the victim of an assassination." A rush of gasps and screams filled the cavernous hall. Leinsdorf continued, "We will play the funeral march from Beethoven's Third Symphony." A second swell of gasps as the audience grappled with the news and the announcement that the music would go on.	1
He is India's most successful Test match captain but Mahendra Singh Dhoni has decided enough is enough. The 33-year-old has retired from Test match cricket, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious career in which he thrilled crowds across the world. Dhoni, who made his debut in 2005, captained India in 60 of his 90 Test matches but decided to quit on Tuesday following the draw with Australia in Melbourne which meant his side conceded the series. In a statement, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said that Dhoni made the decision to retire from Tests "in order to concentrate" on one-day and Twenty20 cricket. "One of India's greatest Test Captains under whose leadership India became the No. 1 team in the Test Rankings MS Dhoni, has decided to retire from Test Cricket citing the strain of playing all formats of Cricket," said the statement. "MS Dhoni has chosen to retire from Test Cricket with immediate effect in order to concentrate on ODI and T20 formats. "BCCI while respecting the decision of MS Dhoni to retire from Test Cricket, wishes to thank him for his enormous contribution to Test Cricket and the laurels that he has brought to India." The decision comes following a difficult year for Dhoni, who has been hampered by a succession of injuries. The wicket-keeper batsman missed five one-day games against Sri Lanka in November after suffering a hand injury, the same problem which forced him out of the opening Test against Australia earlier this month. That should not detract from a stellar career in which Dhoni has become India's highest earning sports star. According to Forbes, he is the fourth highest earning sportsman in the world, raking in $20 million in 2014, placing him ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Kobe Bryant and Lionel Messi. His decision comes just weeks ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand where India will defend its one-day crown. Dhoni will now start preparing for the tournament while Virat Kohli, one of the team's star batsmen, takes charge of the final Test match against Australia in Sydney which starts on January 6. Trailing 2-0 in the four match series, India required victory in Melbourne to keep the series alive. The draw meant that it was unable to overturn the deficit and slumped to yet another overseas defeat -- a recurring theme during Dhoni's reign.	1
Google doesn't have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, but the company's Android software is practically everywhere. As expected, smartphones maintain a major presence at CES. Despite Microsoft and Research in Motion showcasing their wares, the announcements and excitement is all around Google's Android. Every new 4G smartphone and tablet announced by the four major cellular carriers at or during CES runs on Android. Verizon Wireless showcased four smartphones at a news event on Thursday -- LG's Revolution, HTC's Thunderbolt, Motorola's Droid Bionic and a yet-to-be-named offering from Samsung. Touch-screen tablets were also on display with Samsung's Galaxy Tab and Motorola's Xoom. All six mobile devices, which are slated for release in the first half of the year starting as early as March, run on Android. "At the same time that we were building out the [4G]area LTE network, the Android operating system really became a reality," Verizon Wireless CEO Dan Mead said in an interview on Thursday. AT&T announced three smartphones on Wednesday, which take advantage of the carriers' latest network protocol. All three, from Motorola's Atrix 4G, HTC's Inspire 4G and Samsung's Infuse 4G, were Androids. T-Mobile unveiled two new tablets -- LG G-Slate and Dell Streak 7 -- but no new smartphones at its event. Both tablets were running Android. During the week of CES, Sprint Nextel announced one new phone, the Evo Shift 4G from HTC, which runs on  -- take a guess. At Research in Motion's booth, the company showcases mainly the PlayBook, alongside BlackBerry phones that are already on the market. When questioned on phones, RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis reiterated that the company is hard at work on the next iteration of BlackBerry. It's based on the operating system that runs the PlayBook, and these "super phones," as he reportedly called them, will have fast dual-core processors inside. But Motorola Mobility leapt past RIM with an Android phone that packs a dual-core chip. Thanks to the added processing power, the Atrix 4G can dock to a monitor or laptop shell to become a desktop computer running a modified version of Android.	1
Thousands of protesters demonstrated against China's human rights record and its crackdown in Tibet after the Olympic flame arrived in San Francisco Tuesday. Pro-Tibetan demonstrators shout outside the Chinese consulate in San Francisco Tuesday. Chanting and waving flags, the protesters ended their march at the Chinese consulate, where they sat in a dense group, holding flags and banners, as police watched from nearby. "Stop killing," one sign read, while another said, "No human rights, no Olympics." The protests came after passionate demonstrations in London and Paris in which protesters tried to snuff the torch's flame and dozens were arrested. Meanwhile, the Olympic flame was being kept in an undisclosed location in advance of Wednesday's planed 6-mile relay in San Francisco.  Watch how the city is preparing » The run is the only U.S. appearance for the flame, wrapping up the first week of a 23-city global tour. Beijing organizers have said the monthlong international relay will not be stopped despite the protests, but some International Olympic Committee members have suggested an early end should be considered. The IOC's executive board will discuss the torch relay "in general" Thursday or Friday, but there is no proposal on the agenda to end the global tour early, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said.  Watch the flame get the red-carpet treatment » The official Beijing Olympics Web site, controlled by the Chinese organizers, gives little indication of any torch relay disruption. It characterizes the demonstrators as "a small number" of Tibetan separatists. Beijing blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for violence that erupted in March amid protests for Tibetan independence. China has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the demonstrations, which began peacefully on the 49th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising. China's Foreign Ministry Tuesday reacted forcefully to the torch relay protests. "We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France," China spokeswoman Jiang Yu said. "Their despicable activities tarnish the lofty Olympic spirit and challenge all the people loving the Olympic Games around the world." The flame will return to China in May to begin a relay through the host nation, ending in Beijing with the August 8 opening of the Olympic Games. One of the San Francisco torchbearers has dropped out of Wednesday's relay because of fears of protests, a torch relay spokesman said.	1
Negotiators for Iran and six world powers completed the first day of discussions on Iran's nuclear program Monday in Moscow. This third round of talks, called after two previous rounds of discussions yielded little result, was marked by "serious and constructive" discussions, Iran's semi-official FARS News Agency quoted Deputy Chief Negotiator Ali Baqeri as saying. An EU official described the meeting as an "intense and tough exchange of views." Western powers fear that Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons, despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The West has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop Iran from producing nuclear arms. The EU official, who was not authorized to speak to the media due to the sensitivity of the talks, said Iran responded to proposals brought up at the last round of talks in Baghdad, "but, in doing so, brought up lots of questions and well-known positions, including past grievances." Iran rejected calls during earlier talks for it not to enrich uranium to the point that it can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions weighing on its economy. Iran's leaders also continued to take a firm line outside of the negotiations. On Monday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country has been the object of "non-stop conspiracies of all the world powers." "But the efforts of all the hegemonic powers to push the Iranian nation out of the scene will definitely and surely remain futile again this time," he said. EXCLUSIVE: Israel's president warns "time is out" for Iran If the negotiations in Moscow unravel, the potential consequences for the Middle East and the rest of the world could be grave. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. And Iran's strategic position near crucial oil shipping routes means the escalation of tensions could put further pressure on the fragile global economy. After the previous round of negotiations in Baghdad last month, which ran beyond the original schedule, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton offered a glimmer of hope for the Moscow talks. "It's clear that we both want to make progress," she said at the time.	1
One night in late July this year, the Japanese supertanker M. Star was making its way through the Strait of Hormuz -- the chokepoint at the southern tip of the Persian Gulf. It was en route to Japan with 3 million barrels of crude oil. There was a loud thud at the front of the ship. Its hull suffered a substantial square-shaped dent above the waterline. Theories about the cause quickly abounded: a giant wave, a collision with a submarine or another vessel. And then -- six days later -- a militant Sunni group that had been active in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan claimed it had attacked the ship with an explosives-laden boat. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the M. Star "sought to weaken the infidel global order which is thrust into Muslim lands and which loots its resources." For the Brigades, such an attack was a significant departure from previous targets. To begin with, intelligence analysts were skeptical of the claim. But U.S. officials now say it is credible. "Government and industry sources can confirm that the claim by the Abdullah Azzam brigades ... is valid," the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration said in an advisory last week. "The group remains active and can conduct further attacks on vessels in areas in the Strait of Hormuz, southern Arabian Gulf, and western Gulf of Oman,' it said. The Saudis are already anxious about the foothold that al Qaeda has established in neighboring Yemen.  Now the Brigades -- spawned in the squalor of Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon -- may be an emerging player in the region's terror landscape. The Brigades are named after a Palestinian close to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Abdullah Azzam was killed in Pakistan in 1989 by a bomb explosion. The group is led by one Saleh al-Qarawi, who fought U.S. forces in Iraq and got to know al Qaeda's now-dead leader there -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.	1
The Pentagon must hold down its spending and make choices that will anger "powerful people" in an era of economic strain, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a weekend speech in Kansas. Increasing health care costs, a top-heavy  defense budget, and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are hurting the DOD's ability to produce and maintain equipment, he said."We must be honest and upfront about how difficult it is to meet our war-fighting needs. And we must make some tough choices to hold down costs and preserve the essential equipment our troops need to do their jobs," Gates said at the National Press Club on Saturday.The secretary said he was considering cutting spending for both civilian workforces and the military "for the first time in my tenure," which began in 2009. He didn't say how much he felt the cuts would be.For Gates, civilian and military spending are in a tug of war that could become more of a seesaw, where spending on defense equals budgets for education, human services, and veterans.Gates said the Pentagon's overall goal is to keep the war-fighting force strong."We need to make decisions that allow us to continue to have the best force in the world," Gates said.Gates said DOD will have to make decisions on how best to spend its money."We must do everything we can to ensure that the needs of our men and women in uniform are adequately met," said Gates, who will return to the Pentagon next week after two weeks on the road."We can no longer afford not to do it," he said.Gates said DOD is also cutting operations and maintenance costs for fighter jets, and is reviewing how the military can shift some of its equipment into new platforms to cut costs. He said some equipment that was being scrapped by defense contractors would be produced at government facilities.On Saturday, Gates warned that health care costs are coming to "an unsustainable point" -- the highest ever -- and said DOD will have to come up with a plan to reduce waste, while limiting cost increases.DOD is spending $7.7 billion on health-care benefits for retired military personnel and defense civilian employees, and another $4.6 billion on benefits for veterans, he said."We need to be accountable to the men and women in uniform, to the American taxpayer, and to future generations that we are	0
NATO officials said Monday they have sent a team to investigate an incident in central Afghanistan where troops thought they were battling militants, but instead may have exchanged gunfire with Afghan police. The operation, which took place Sunday in Daikundi province, led to the death of three Afghan police officers and wounded three others, the International Security Assistance Force said. NATO troops were conducting a patrol in a village when they came across nine armed people who were setting up what "appeared to be an ambush position," the force said in a statement. The service members called in aerial support. Later, troops determined the air strike may have been carried out against an Afghan police team, the force said. "While we take extraordinary precaution while conducting operations to avoid friendly casualties, it appears innocent people may have been mistakenly targeted," said U.S. Army Col. Rafael Torres, the director of the force's Joint Command Combined Joint Operations Center director.	1
Manchester United fans are used to dramatic finishes, but not against Stoke City at Old Trafford. Alex Ferguson's recently published autobiography maybe full of tales of derring-do against more illustrious opposition, but these are wildly different days at United at present. United were a goal down inside five minutes when Jonny Evans attempted clearance rebounded off Peter Crouch and past David De Gea. Robin van Persie calmed United nerves with an equalizer two minutes before the break but the relief was short-lived when Marko Arnautovic restored Stoke's lead moments later with a well-executed free kick. And that's how it stayed until the 78th minute before Wayne Rooney came to the rescue with a header to bring United level before Javier Hernandez scored the winner two minutes later. Read more: Russian racism furore is latest headache for FIFA The 3-2 win eases the pressure on David Moyes and keeps United, who have 14 points from nine matches, in touching distance of the league leaders Arsenal. Arsene Wenger's side dispatched bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace 2-0 at Selhurst Park in the day's early kick-off. The Premier League newboys, who are currently without a manager after Ian Holloway's resignation in midweek, were on equal terms after a competitive first half but Mikel Arteta's 47th minute penalty gave the away side a deserved lead. The Spanish international was later red-carded for a professional foul on former Gunners forward Marouane Chamakh, but Arsenal made sure of the three points when Olivier Giroud headed in Aaron Ramsey's deftly chipped cross. The win keeps Arsene Wenger's side two points clear at the top of the table with 22 points from nine games. Liverpool move up to second after thrashing West Bromwich Albion 4-1 at Anfield. Luis Suarez got the Merseysiders off to a flier with goals in the 12th minute and 17th minute before completing his hat-trick 10 minutes after the break. James Morrison pulled one back for West Brom when he converted from the penalty spot in the 66th minute, but hopes of a comeback were extinguished 11 minutes later when Daniel Sturridge scored a delightful fourth, chipping the ball over goalkeeper Boaz Myhill.	1
Start-ups are fighting a war for talent in Silicon Valley, and the companies that actively welcome men and women are going to win it. Smart companies don't recruit "brogrammers." The term brogrammer is a joke, of course. Male software engineers don't actually pop their collars, wear sunglasses and lift weights while writing code and share hot tubs with bikini-clad women. But the joke is funny for some people because it reflects a truth about a community where certain places exclude great talent in favor of frat house fun. The tech industry's testosterone level can make the thickest-skinned women consider a different career. But the rise of the brogrammer joke and its ensuing backlash has some benefits: It helps talented women choose worthy employers, it gives a name and face to a problem that plagues the industry and it publicly shames some of the most sexist offenders. In 1999, Google's Marissa Mayer almost didn't take the job at the all-male start-up because there were more women at another firm that made her an offer. If Mayer had just graduated from college today with offers from two equally compelling start-ups -- one all-male and one not -- it's clear which one she would choose. If you write software for a living and you're located in Silicon Valley, you have your pick of employment options at an array of tech start-ups -- yes, even in this economy. When a recruiter's pitch is: "Wanna bro down and crush some code?" -- like San Francisco-based Klout's was -- you get a sense of what that company is looking for. If you're a woman, it's not you. That's pretty sad, but it's not all bad. As a woman and a software developer, crossing Klout off the list of places where I might work helps me narrow my options. I'd rather find out that an employer glorifies young dudes before I take a position than afterward. That's one small way brogrammer culture is actually useful. It's a red flag for women engineers, product developers, designers, project managers, marketers, business development and PR specialists. It says: This is a company that you'd want to avoid.	1
Chile poured firefighters and police into the battle against a wildfire that swept through hundreds of homes in the Pacific coastal city of Valparaiso, leaving at least 12 dead, Â¿Â¿Â¡Â including a Chilean who is in critical condition.Â¿Â¡ÂThe fire tore through hundreds of homes and businesses in Valparaiso, a city of about 80,000 people, early on July 2, according to Reuters.âIt looks like the worst fires in this country,â said Carlos Velasco, a spokesman for the Santiago Fire Department.Â¿Â¿Â¿Â¦ A firefighter is seen standing near a car as fire burns down a car and some structures on the second floor of a home that were lost at Valparaiso, Chile, July 2, 2010. The fire broke out in the early part of the day.

The world has a new alliance to save vanishing frogs, toads and salamanders. A frog swims in a pond in Munich, Germany, in June. A coalition of organizations established the Amphibian Survival Alliance this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides and climate change. The scientists said amphibians are the world's most threatened group of animals. Though they thrived on Earth for more than 360 million years, one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's amphibian specialist group. "The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival," said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group. He said the new alliance, formed at the Amphibian Mini Summit at the Zoological Society of London, will focus efforts on the biggest threat to amphibians: infectious disease and habitat destruction. The group includes amphibian specialists working in the wild as well as those in zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens worldwide. "Amphibians have so much to offer humans," said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart. "Many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases." But as amphibians die out, so do opportunities to develop new medicines, he said. The southern gastric brooding frog, for instance, could have led to the development of a treatment for human peptic ulcers had it not gone extinct, Stuart said. "We simply cannot afford to let this current amphibian extinction crisis go unchecked," he said. Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis. "Amphibians seem to have been hit the hardest of all vertebrate species," said Blaustein, a professor of zoology at Oregon State University. "The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it."	1
An unlicensed doctor has been charged with causing an HIV outbreak in a remote village in northwestern Battambang province, local media report. More than 800 panicked residents of Rokar village sought urns containing their loved ones’ ashes to save themselves from infection.The incident started on Dec. 8 when a doctor allegedly injected himself with HIV-contaminated blood in an attempt to cure himself of the disease. The doctor reportedly injected himself a total of 10 times. He then took the blood to a nearby hospital, where it was used to treat 11 patients.The doctor’s family refused to cooperate with the investigation, but local authorities later said they had found a small number of HIV-contaminated blood bags in his house.The doctor died on Dec. 17 and was buried in an unmarked grave. His family has been charged with murder and is under house arrest.The government has said the village has been declared a “safe zone” since the HIV outbreak began, but people living there are still living in fear.“I can’t go anywhere,” one village resident told Khmer Times. “They want to shoot us for no reason.”HIV-positive Cambodia has seen an outbreak of infections among gay men, but now authorities are investigating a possible connection between HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases.Cambodia's Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery confirmed the outbreak on Tuesday, but made no mention of any link to HIV.Authorities say that because of the outbreak, hundreds of villagers have been tested for various diseases and are at risk for exposure to the disease.The ministry has advised people living in Rokar village to isolate themselves as authorities carry out a three-month study of HIV and other diseases in the area.According to the Ministry of Health, tuberculosis has already been confirmed, while malaria is suspected.People living in Rokar believe AIDS is a trick to scare them away and keep them from returning home.“After they come with AIDS they ask for money,” one man said.In order to find out where the HIV outbreaks are occurring in the area, authorities will conduct a three-month field study.Kem Sokha, the minister of health, said: “These incidents are serious.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coasted to victory in Tuesday's elections, defying pre-election polls showing his Likud party trailing his main rival, the center-left Zionist Union. Ever the master politician and brilliant tactician, he used the politics of fear to galvanize his right-wing base, which ultimately secured him a fourth term. Israel, however, may not fare as well as its leader did at the polls. In a matter of days, Netanyahu exposed his true attitude toward Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, in the process threatening to further erode an already strained relationship with the White House. Less than two weeks ago, Netanyahu declared that his speech of June 2009 at Bar-Ilan University, where he publicly endorsed a demilitarized Palestinian state, is no longer relevant. On Monday, he continued on this theme, announcing that a Palestinian state would not be established under his watch. These comments were tactical moves aimed at mobilizing his base, but so was his Bar-Ilan speech a maneuver aimed at appeasing U.S. President Barack Obama and quelling criticism from abroad. Ultimately, political expedience led Netanyahu to reveal what many critics had long suspected: He has never supported a two-state solution. In the last six years of his premiership, Netanyahu has spoken out repeatedly against a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed land swaps -- the basis for a two-state solution; insisted that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people -- a condition no Palestinian leader can accept; and presided over unprecedented settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians regard as their future capital. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister has disparaged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at every opportunity, asserting that he encourages terrorism -- a claim that was contradicted by the head of Israel's top security service -- and repeating the mantra that Abbas is not a legitimate peace partner. In 2011, he reportedly quashed the Palestinian leader's draft peace agreement that had been secretly negotiated with former Israeli President Shimon Peres. In a less guarded moment, Netanyahu told Israeli writer Etgar Keret that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was "insoluble."	1
The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour. Vogue editors Anna Wintour and Carine Roitfeld at AmfAR's 10th Annual New York Gala in January 2008. Wintour has yet to announce any plans to retire but her advancing age -- she's 60 this year -- has stoked speculation that after more than 20 years in the role it might be time to leave. One name touted as a possible replacement is Carine Roitfeld, the highly respected editor in chief of Vogue Paris. Read more about Carine Roitfeld Roitfeld is accustomed to the speculation, describing it as "frustrating." She told CNN she hadn't been offered the job and even if she was she probably wouldn't take it. "It's a bit like for an actor. Do you want to go to Hollywood or do you want to stay here in Paris and do the cinema I like to do?," Roitfeld said. "I think I prefer to stay here in Paris." Watch Carine Roitfeld Revealed A fixture at the U.S. title since 1988, Wintour has a fearsome reputation, mostly courtesy of the 2006 film starring Meryl Streep, "The Devil Wears Prada." The film is based on a book penned by a former assistant at American Vogue who has denied suggestions Wintour was the inspiration for the demanding and odious lead character. Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN "I think Anna does a great job... I think she's a great person." She said she would be honored to be asked to fill Wintour's shoes, but pointed out that "it's a very different job." "I'm very happy at French Vogue to be able to do everything -- almost everything -- I want in the magazine," she said. "It would be too political at American Vogue for me. And I'm not sure I'm talking enough good English to work there." At Vogue Paris, Roitfeld knows her readers. They are a select group of incredibly stylish and wealthy women who are thrilled rather than alienated by unconventional ideas. The best-selling edition so far, in August 2003, featured French actress Sophie Marceau on the cover smoking a cigarette.	1
If you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the Mitt Romney campaign office, you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected. About the only color you would have seen were the red and white in the Romney-Ryan posters. If you met with Romney's senior campaign team -- the decision makers -- you would have said major corporations in America have more diversity on their boards of directors than these guys. At a Romney campaign event, followers of mine on Twitter always played the "do-you-know-that-one-black-person-who-is-always-standing-behind-Mitt-with-a-sign" game. Seriously. Seeing someone black, Hispanic or Asian at a Romney campaign rally was always a sight to behold. So why in the world is Mitt Romney now largely blaming minorities for the butt-kicking administered to him by President Obama? Politics: Jindal slams Romney for 'gifts' comment about minorities, young voters In a conference call with donors, Romney attributed his loss to the president playing Santa Claus by showering minorities and young voters with "gifts" -- health care, student loans and those things Americans clearly don't need. "The Obama campaign was following the old playbook of giving a lot of stuff to groups that they hoped they could get to vote for them and be motivated to go out to the polls, specifically the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people," Romney said during the conference call. "In each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups." Opinion: Democrats, don't get too cocky Hey, black people, Mitt reveals what you got for your vote! "With regards to African-American voters, 'Obamacare' was a huge plus -- and was highly motivational to African-American voters. You can imagine for somebody making $25-, or $30-, or $35,000 a year, being told 'You're now going to get free health care' -- particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 a family, in perpetuity -- I mean this is huge. Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus." Hey, Hispanic people, what did Obama have for you behind door No. 2?	1
Chinese authorities in eastern Jiangsu Province have launched a massive manhunt for a suspect in a deadly armed robbery, according to 中国 (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Zhōngguó; oe romanized: Zhùjiànggòng) (Chinese: ) that includes several local municipalities and cities.The victim was killed when he was held up at gunpoint in an intersection known as Zhongshanxin Street in the Jing'an District.According to CCTV, the suspect is being sought because he robbed the victim at gunpoint at 5:30 a.m. on February 19, 2015.As of today, CCTV has not released the suspect's description, but the video of the robbery shows that he was in his 30s or 40s."Two days after Zhongshanxin Street was attacked, more than 30 million yuan (roughly $4 million) was stolen from an electronic-payment system in Hangzhou," Jiangxi police said Monday.The attack has now led to the death of the victim, whose body will be sent to Hainan Medical University. A police officer said that the man was about to enter his home to buy flowers when he was attacked by the suspect, who fired several shots into the victim's chest."He died immediately," the police officer said.A crime scene has been set up in Hangzhou. The force has placed the CCTV camera which filmed the robbery in a car so anyone who sees the video can be arrested.According to the preliminary investigation, the man was waiting for his vehicle when the suspect came up from behind and attacked him. The man then took the car and disappeared.A search operation has been launched in the area to track down the suspect. A woman in charge of the investigation said she was concerned that the unidentified suspect would get other victims.She said that if there is someone else who knows from the CCTV video, he, his associates or their associates can be arrested within 24 hours."The victim was a driver. That means he was a very well-known person in the society. There are also many witnesses who saw him. The CCTV video has been taken so far and we are still waiting for the result," the officer said.	0
Ollanta Humala, a left-leaning Peruvian politician who promises reforms in education and services to the poor, was sworn in as the nation's president Thursday. In his first address as president, Humala stressed equality, saying he wants Peru to be "a place where everyone enjoys the same rights to abundance and happiness." "Economic growth and social inclusion must march together," he said of his governing philosophy. He succeeds Alan Garcia, who oversaw a period of robust economic growth as president, but who nonetheless was unpopular and criticized for promoting business at the expense of indigenous groups and the environment. Humala, an ex-army officer who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2006 as a leftist ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, reinvented himself as a more moderate leader. He calmed markets and worries that his moderation was a facade to win the election by naming a Cabinet made up of political moderates. The new president has promised to spread the benefits of Peru's economic boom to the poor. He has cited needs to improve the nation's infrastructure, water, sanitation and education, particularly in rural areas. A number of presidents from other Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Chile and Brazil, were on hand to witness the swearing-in ceremony. There was a small oddity during the swearing in of Humala and his two vice presidents, when they all swore allegiance to Peru's 1979 Constitution. That document, however, was replaced in 1993 by a new one drafted during the presidency of strongman Alberto Fujimori. Humala defeated Fujimori's daughter, Keiko, to win the presidency. The slap at the current Constitution resulted in boos and shouts from members of Fujimori's party. Several times in his speech, Humala talked about the importance of unity. "Reality requires a new social contract that makes it possible for all Peruvians to live together," he said. He added that he wants "to be seen as a defender of human rights and of freedom of the press and expression." Other leftist leaders in Latin America, such as Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Venezuela's Chavez, have been criticized by press freedom organizations for clamping down on the media. Humala promised change, but warned that it would not be as swift as his critics fear, or as some of his supporters desire. To be lasting, he said, "any changes must be gradual and rational."	1
Congress went beyond the edge of the fiscal cliff to get a deal done in back-to-back, late-night sessions to avert a financial crisis, or at least to put it off for a couple months. Here are winners and losers in the deal: Winners Vice President Joe Biden: This might not have been the "Big f***ing deal" that he proclaimed the passage of Obamacare to be, but it was a pretty big deal. Biden used his years of experience cutting deals in the Senate to work out a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He used the same playbook in the first extension of the Bush-era tax cuts in 2010 and the debt ceiling fight in 2011, walking through the proposal with progressives in the Senate and then the House to bring them in line. Then he went and got a sandwich. Biden hasn't ruled out a run for the White House when Obama's second term is up and his role in this deal makes a President Biden believable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the "dance partner" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate. It's too early to tell whether McConnell will pay the price with hard-line conservatives at home in Kentucky who have already shown that they can oust Senate incumbents who anger them by working with Democrats. No real Republican opponent has emerged in his re-election race in 2014 but they mobilized two years ago to elect Rand Paul to the Senate over McConnell's hand-picked candidate. Inside the deal President Barack Obama: White House insiders say he learned lessons in his first term and would be a tougher negotiator in his second. He didn't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away, but getting Republican votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant. And he did pick Biden to be his vice president. The wealthy: Despite higher taxes, it could have been a lot worse. The unemployed: Another year of benefits for those actively looking for work. Five things to know about the fiscal cliff Losers The employed: The two-year payroll tax holiday is over, so take-home pay will go down -- around $2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2% to 6.2%. But ending the tax holiday will add about $120 billion to federal coffers.	1
As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event. Two dozen teams will pound the pitch, put in flying tackles and perhaps lose teeth in an effort to claim the 2012 championship trophy. For the New Zealand Sevens team, it's time to defend last year's victory. For spectators, it's a chance to run up a credit card bill on beer and bizarre costumes. But for HSBC, this year's tournament marks its return to the stands as a sponsor after a 17-year hiatus. "There's more to sports than just the players on the field -- there's the financial funding," said DJ Forbes, the captain of the New Zealand Sevens. "If a sponsorship deal is held in high esteem, potential sponsors are going be sure the money they invest is put in the right places." But is the right place the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens? HSBC thinks so. Even as the bank is cutting tens of thousands of jobs worldwide, HSBC is investing in rugby ahead of the sport's inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. "Rugby has changed enormously. The HK Sevens is a very popular tournament but was much more standalone than it is now," said Giles Morgan, HSBC Group head of Sponsorship and Events. "That and its upcoming inclusion in the Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro have made the game much more international and much broader. " But while HSBC has ramped up its sponsorship investment in Hong Kong, the "world's local bank" is winding down some of its Asian retail operations -- notably in Japan and Thailand, while cutting 30,000 workers worldwide by the end of next year. All of this is a cost-cutting plan as laid out by HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver to save some $3.5 billion. Morgan quickly defends HSBC's sponsorship as a calculated strategy. "We very much regard our sponsorship as a business -- with business objectives," he said. "This is not about a fun investment. We are targeting key demographics and key geographies. "It made sense for HSBC to come back," he added. "We didn't know rugby was going to grow the way it did."	1
Sometimes, it pays to read between the lines. At least that may be the message --and, more accurately, the hope -- of workers at the National Weather Service office in Anchorage, Â a town that is, in essence, a microcosm of America's weather woes.This week, meteorologists and weather experts, in a little-noticed bulletin to about 400 of the Weather Service's roughly 1,300 employees, warned of the dangers of Alaska's extreme winter weather. They offered tips for how to avoid Â and how to protect from dangerous winter storms that are predicted to batter Alaska this year.The Weather Service's chief of forecasting, Dr. Bill Weintraub, warned in a separate message, that he would be sending these tips to employees of the Alaska Division of Insurance in Anchorage."This is a very serious time of year in Alaska and we believe it's time for everyone to step up," Dr. Weintraub said in a phone interview.The Alaska Division of Insurance has received Dr. Weintraub's message, according to Paul Chueg, an AICR spokesman. But the division has not yet reviewed Dr. Weintraub's forecast, said Chueg.Because of the federal funding that pays for this division, the division said it does not act as an insurer, he said.A few months ago, Dr. Weintraub sent the Weather Service employees a memo, telling them not to worry about the coming winter. The weather was going to get worse, he said, and not as bad as last fall, when it snowed on the Kenai Peninsula. But there wasn't any threat of floods or tornadoes.He said he was also worried that workers weren't listening enough to warnings about the looming storms that were supposed to hit Alaska.A few weeks later, the Weather Service issued its own warning, telling workers that "severe weather is likely" this winter. That winter, which began the first Monday of December, was the heaviest in Alaska history, said Chueg."In terms of precipitation, it was the wettest winter in the state in a century," he said. "We've only seen one other event where Alaska has experienced the heavy precipitation."The Weather Service released its winter weather forecast on Nov. 27. It predicted, not long before midnight on Christmas Eve, that	0
At least 18 people have died and 44 people are missing after Typhoon Wipha pummeled the Tokyo area on Wednesday. The majority died after heavy rain triggered flooding and landslides that blocked roads and crushed houses in Oshima, a small island 120 km (75 miles) south of Tokyo, a local official said. One woman died in the Tokyo metropolitan area but the capital was largely spared significant damage. Forty one people were still missing on the offshore island as of Thursday morning local time. iReport: Heavy winds near Tokyo as Typhoon Wipha hits More than 500 domestic and international flights were canceled at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports and the national rail operator halted bullet train services in central and northern Japan. The typhoon moved north along the Pacific coast of Japan and was expected to reach the northernmost island of Hokkaido by late Wednesday. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the main electricity supplier in Tokyo and central Japan, said blackouts affected more than 56,000 households. TEPCO, which has been struggling to deal with a series of leaks at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, said workers at the plant were "on vigil" and accumulated rainwater had been released from storage tanks. Typhoon Nari pounds the Philippines, killing 13	1
A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes. "This could be one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in  historical memory," said Bruce Johnson, a spokesman for the Birmingham office of the weather service.The service, which maintains a network of radar in Alabama, is already anticipating the widespread damage potential from this tornado outbreak. "We are in a tornado emergency. We are going to prepare for this, and we will continue to closely monitor this situation," said Johnson.This is what is happening right now:What is the latest?Here's what you need to know:(Alabama) — The National Weather Service in Birmingham says severe storms are on the move following a very late-season storm system that stalled out over the western half of the state.The storm system moved across Georgia, South Carolina, and the Carolinas late last week.The storm system is not expected to get very far today.(South Carolina) — The National Weather Service in Greenville, S.C., issued a hurricane watch for South Carolina, saying the storm could bring significant moisture and a bit of rain to the state.The storm, which started as a large disturbance on Friday, stalled over the South on Saturday and was no threat to Georgia today.(Georgia) — The National Weather Service in Atlanta forecasts heavy rainfall from Friday night into early Sunday morning for the North and South, with large bands of heavy rain in the Southeast.The main storm system that stalled over the region on Friday was expected to move across the Southeast on Saturday, and the National Weather Service says the storm should hit parts of South Carolina by early Sunday morning.(Georgia) — The National Weather Service in Atlanta says a cold front is moving across the state.The front is expected to move across the lower 48 states early Sunday and could drop up to 1″ of snow in some areas, with higher amounts moving into the higher elevations of the Southeast in the overnight hours.(Kentucky) — The National Weather Service in Louisville says a front is starting to move across the state, bringing scattered heavy rain showers.	0
At least 10 people drowned in the Mediterranean when a ship sank between Libya and the Italian island of Lampedusa Sunday, according to Italy's official news agency. Seventy people, including 62 men and eight women, were rescued, ANSA reported. One of the women is pregnant, it said. The search by Italy's Navy and Coast Guard is underway for any other survivors, but the report did not say how many people were still missing. The report referred to the ship's passengers as migrants, suggesting they are from North Africa. A boat carrying about 100 migrants from Tunisia ran into trouble in the same area two months ago, triggering a rescue effort by the Italians and NATO ships. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Boats carrying migrants often are in peril at sea. Amnesty International reported at least 1,500 deaths last year of people attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea. The human rights monitoring group said some of the deaths could have been prevented. "The desire of some European countries to prevent irregular migration (people who do not have permission to live and work in these countries) has undermined safe and timely rescue at sea," Amnesty International said.	1
Taiwan's former leader Chen Shui-bian and and his wife Wu Shu-jen have been sentenced to 20 years in jail, the island's High Court reported. Both had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment after their convictions in 2009 on charges of corruption. The court fined Chen 170 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $5.3 million) and fined his wife 200 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $6.2 million). During his trial, prosecutors said Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $18.5 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for. Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony.  Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor. Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China.	1
Tens of thousands of residents began evacuating Sunday morning from coastal Japan in anticipation of a possible tsunami following Chile's 8.8-magnitude earthquake. The northern part of the main island was looking at the possibility of a tsunami at least 9 feet high, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Rail service was halted in coastal areas and residents were urged to evacuate low-lying areas of the island nation. The warning primarily affected fishing areas and tourist areas; major cities like Tokyo, which is inland, were not affected. Sunday's alert was Japan's first major tsunami warning in more than 15 years, the agency reported. A tsunami spawned by Chile's 1960 earthquake killed 140 people in Japan. On Saturday, tsunami warnings from Chile's temblor initially covered the entire Pacific region, but they were canceled less than 18 hours later except for Russia, Japan and the Philippines. The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a Level-2 tsunami alert for the east coast of the Philippines. A Level-2 alert means people are advised to stay away from the shoreline; residents near coastal areas facing the Pacific Ocean are advised to go farther inland. Meanwhile, an official with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the island chain of Hawaii "dodged a bullet" after smaller-than-expected waves were reported. Coast Guard crews said they had found no significant damage to ports or waterways as a result of the tsunami. "There was no assessment of any damage in any county, which is quite remarkable," said Gov. Linda Lingle, who said witnesses had reported seeing "dramatic surges going on in the ocean." The only airport that was shut, the Hilo airport on Hawaii, reopened late in the afternoon. "If people have a confirmed reservation they can go to the airport now and they will be able to catch their flights," Lingle said.	1
The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that it is investigating an incident in which a panel separated from the wing of a Boeing 757 while it was in flight last week. iReporter and Flight 1250 passenger Paul Shepherd took this photo of the damage through the aircraft's window. The incident occurred Saturday on US Airways Flight 1250 from Orlando, Florida, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the NTSB said in a statement. The separation occurred over Maryland. The aircraft landed in Philadelphia about 30 minutes later, and none of the 174 passengers or six crew members aboard was injured. The panel, on the trailing edge of the upper side of the left wing, broke loose and struck several windows toward the rear of the aircraft, causing the outer pane of one window to crack, the agency said. Pressurization of the cabin was not compromised. The wing panel has not been located. NTSB investigators are using a computer program to pinpoint the area where it might be and will notify local authorities that an aircraft part may be there, the statement said. The plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have arrived at the NTSB laboratory in Washington, the agency said, and are being evaluated. E-mail to a friend	1
Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethnicity who had been held at the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda, officials said Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. is "extremely grateful to the government of Bermuda." "Above all, this was a humanitarian act," Bermudan Premier Ewart Brown told CNN in an interview at his Cabinet office in Hamilton, Bermuda. "We don't see it as quid pro quo." The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a Justice Department statement. They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects. The four were flown by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda and were accompanied by U.S. and Bermudan representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees. A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries. Brown said he read an article on the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees' fates in The Washington Post while he was in Washington for a White House meeting in May. He said he decided to put an offer to the U.S. government "on the table." He said Bermuda, a British colony, told London of its intentions, but not until late in the process. Britain must approve the transfer for it to be permanent, Brown said, adding that he believes the issue may raise tension between Bermuda and Britain. The issue is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs being sent to any country but China. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far-west China. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. They left Afghanistan after U.S. bombings began in the area in October 2001 and were apprehended in Pakistan, the statement said.  Watch concerns about resettling the Uyghur detainees » "According to available information, these individuals did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent to take any hostile action against the United States," the statement said.	1
An American man has been detained in North Korea, two State Department officials told CNN. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of not being identified said the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the vernal equinox is coming soon.Related:He was last seen in early January leaving the city of Chongjin, according to the sources. Officials said the man's family is in grief and they fear he fell into the hands of authorities.North Korea's leadership is in disarray over how to handle the situation."In the North Korea we don't have a good system of dealing with the ordinary citizen. We've seen several cases of kidnapping," one U.S. official told CNN.A North Korean woman looks at the black and white photos of her missing husband, who has been missing since early December, outside Seoul's main train station."The Kim regime has a problem with defectors because it blames them," the official said. "We have been talking to the Koreans to try to get them to defect but their government doesn't want them to become martyrs."Related:The U.S. officials told CNN that the man is "suspected of spying for the North Korean government."The State Department declined to comment. The U.S. embassy in Pyongyang referred questions to the North Korean government.This is the first time the U.S. has publicly identified a U.S. citizen who has been detained by North Korea.The country's news media has been filled with reports of the disappearance by North Korean security services of some 40 Americans. The most recent victim is Matthew Eissenstat, a 33-year-old missionary, who was arrested in December 2016 for defection and is now serving a 10-year prison sentence.While many of the Americans in North Korea are thought to be in prison, authorities in North Korea have rarely been transparent about the whereabouts of those believed to be behind bars. The U.S. has been seeking more information about U.S. citizens who are thought to be behind bars in the country.The State Department will have an "unusually aggressive" approach to the North Korea, two officials said. "It will be an aggressive and very transparent approach," one official said."The approach to North Korea is to find the truth and then deal with	0
Brian McLaughlin used to arrive 20 minutes early to on-site client meetings. He would drive around the parking lot to find a space close to the building, and then go inside to cool off from the short walk. The extra weight he  carried was no problem. So, when the company's CEO was ready to start a meeting, he was waiting to take his seat.McLaughlin is one of many who, after years of being on the same team at all hours, are now managing to squeeze in a few personal tasks. They have learned to leave their offices at the same time, no matter what, and even drive home in the afternoons. And, they're making their own schedules and taking an occasional night out when they can.They've figured out how to keep a work-life balance, and they're feeling better not having to work a traditional 9 to 5.Most of this has been accomplished with the help of new digital technology, such as virtual reality. Virtual reality involves putting on a headset and then looking around through a display of what's going on in a physical space.Virtual reality could even be used in offices to help people who want to work from home, or to help them stay connected with colleagues at times when they have a few extra minutes they could use."We're finding it's a great way for us to work from home, or from coffee shops, whether it's one day or three days a week" - says John Eriksson, whose company helps business people find and choose how to do their job.The technology also has benefits for many employees who can use virtual reality to work from their own home. Virtual reality offers them the opportunity to work from home, and, in fact, the technology could even help some companies that have long had office space transform their buildings into co-working spaces."It's a great way to put a face on someone's business," says Rob Wiegman, who manages the Co-working Space at the University of Texas.The virtual reality technology has the potential to be very useful to businesses."If you think of every business in the world today as potentially, like most of our consumers, a consumer of products and services, in other words, businesses, then the world is really an immersive world," says Wiegman, who also manages the University of Texas's co-working space.	0
With less than a month until Christmas, toy retail experts are predicting that Santa's sleigh won't be the only thing flying through the sky this holiday season. With the holiday shopping season looming, researchers are looking for the best presents to best prepare shoppers for the big day."The fact is that we only have so much power over consumers' choices. We don't have complete control," said Joe McFarling, president and CEO of the American Association of Toy Retailers. "We hope it will be a little more benign, but clearly the consumer has a lot more power over the amount we spend with them."On the other hand, companies have the means to influence shoppers during the holiday season. And while a lot of the attention will be focused on toys, executives at many companies have pointed to other areas that they think need more attention in the months ahead."I think the thing that retailers have to really focus on is providing value and convenience in how we approach our customers," said Michael Sacks, senior vice president of public affairs at Wal-Mart Stores Inc."Our biggest challenge is the holiday season has never been easier for consumers. From the beginning of the year, we've been working to ensure we'll have better inventory and a competitive assortment," said Mike Cavan, executive vice president of merchandising for Target Corp.There is one thing that is certain: the holiday spending season will not be the same as the previous one."We still think there are a number of areas that retailers could use some help. The most important one is our inventory," said Steve Stengel, president of Stengel Group. "There are too many things that retailers could do to improve their supply. Our industry needs to do something to provide a better supply of inventory. That will help retailers like Wal-Mart and Target."Some of the areas companies are talking about include better supply of toys in stores. The holiday season is expected to see a jump in the average number of toys sold at Wal-Mart stores to $1 billion."We've made significant investments in toys this year and also had very high levels of sales in the holiday quarter," said Stengel. "We believe we'll have more inventory from our suppliers in the spring."In a survey of 1,500 manufacturers, the Association of Toys R Us Stores found that the most	0
As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Ever since the pair impressed viewers with their hosting capabilities, there have been calls for them to helm any and all such events. It seems like fans can't get enough of their hilarity, and all eyes will once again be on them to keep the Globes flowing. In honor of the BFFs whose friendship and careers have been pretty impressive, here are five trivia facts about Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and the duo that is TAmy (as we like to call them, because that's what you do with beloved Hollywood couples). Tina Fey: 1) You really could call her Liz Fey will always be known as the woman who gave us the quirky character of Liz Lemon on "30 Rock." But did you know that her real name is Elizabeth Stamatina Fey? 2) And just like Liz Lemon ... She's a self-described "supernerd," having spent her teen years hanging out at game nights instead of dating. 3) She made 'Saturday Night Live' history In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer. 4) Fey is a 'Mean Girl' One of the greatest achievements we would like to thank her for is writing the script for the now almost cult classic 2004 film, "Mean Girls." Fey also appeared in the movie as Ms. Norbury. 5) '30 Rock' had a family connection Fey is married to composer Jeff Richmond, who wrote music for her hit NBC show. The couple are the parents of two daughters. Special coverage: Awards season 2014 Amy Poehler: 1) She's got a theater in New York City Poehler is one of the co-founders of New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, which sprang from the original improv group in Chicago where she got her start. The theater offers affordable comedy shows and Poehler has been known to pop up here and there in more than a few. 2) Poehler is tied to history The actress made her "SNL" cast member debut on the first show after 9/11. 3) She's also made some history	1
"She was a professor?" That's what an astonished caseworker at Adult Protective Services asked about Margaret Mary Vojtko when informed of the 83-year-old woman's destitute situation, according to an op-ed in the  New Orleans Times-Picayune"She came from the lower class of Eastern European immigrants and she was a professor of mathematics and physics," the caseworker said, according to the article. The woman's husband lost his job and was not able to take care of her, so he let her live in their home.But things changed after her mother died, and while the woman was still in her 60s, she began to show signs of dementia and began to have severe financial problems, the caseworker said. Margaret Mary Vojtko was "in the hospital at least five times as an adult," the worker said.She was in-home care for a year while her husband worked and was later taken into custody, the worker said.But that was a single moment of trouble. According to the New Orleans Advocate, she was placed in residential care after the second hospitalization."Margaret Mary Vojtko is a former professor of mathematics and physics at Tulane University, the New Orleans' oldest college," the Advocate's writer, Mary Jo Pitzen, wrote. "She retired as a professor but has not published a book since she retired 14 years ago."Pitzen reported it was a "major shock" to people in her life, especially her daughter, who she lived with and was raised by."Margaret Mary Vojtko was a teacher for 45 years," Pitzen wrote. "In the early years of her career, she became a professor of Mathematics and Physics at Tulane University where she taught for 45 years and published her first book, Math Is My Hobby, in 1981."There was one more name of concern when it came to Margaret Mary Vojtko, according to the Times-Picayune: her brother, David Vojtko, a New Orleans city councilman and member of the board of the Louisiana Association for the Deaf.The Advocate noted that David Vojtko, a graduate of Louisiana's Agricultural and Mechanical College then the University of New Orleans, worked for several years at Louisiana State University as a professor of mathematics and physics when he realized his	0
Brazilian legend Pele once called soccer the "beautiful game" and at its best it showcases the very pinnacle of human endeavor as nations and communities are united in the common goal of ÃÂÂwinning.ÃÂÂ (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)The best thing about this World Cup so far? Seeing how little soccer has changed from decades past. And yet, the game is more popular than ever.It's more expensive too. $7.40 for a small bag of popcorn, $1.15 for a hot dog and $1.60 for a small beer. But don't worry, you won't get hurt by the price. The Brazilians have invented a new one-size-fits-all soft drink called Pernambucano that sells for $3.75 and is just as refreshing. The most expensive beer in the bar has been a $10 drink called the "World Cup Beer" that you drink by the pool of the presidential palace. Oh wait, it has a name? I forgot.Here's what we all need: a new World Cup trophy -- preferably a giant statue of Neymar, but preferably the kind with legs attached. Oh, how we need a trophy for the World Cup: it's the thing we're really after.I've been told by more than one colleague that the best thing about World Cups is the atmosphere. Sure, it's the players and their supporters who are really enthralled -- but you can't put a price on getting a crowd into a stadium, especially when the event is a game.And now, some of the best fans in the world -- Brazilians.***By any standards, Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city. More than one of my favorite photographers -- Ansel Adams, who was born right here -- called it the "Jewel of the South." But to those who don't know the area, the beauty is overwhelming. It's home to more than three million people. And Rio has more than 30,000 miles of beach, of course, plus the most beautiful golf courses in the world.So when someone who's supposed to live in Europe -- or at least Europe's equivalent of the U.S. -- turns to you with the word "Lisbon," they're not talking about Bordeaux or	0
The deadly attack in Kabul on Shi'ite worshippers celebrating the feast of Ashura adds one more layer to the country's overlapping security crises. And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan,  which have been simmering for years.Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called it an act of "ethnic cleansing". But if the Shi'ite militia is the victim, it is the most tangible manifestation of an increasingly tense religious struggle in Afghanistan between Shi'ites, who were largely loyal to Kabul, and Sunnis, who made up the overwhelming majority of the population.A young man is injured by an explosive device believed to have been thrown by a blast near the city of Jalalabad [AFP]At a meeting on Monday, Karzai blamed the attack on the Taliban, the regional Islamic insurgency with which the Western-allied Karzai government is in open conflict.Karzai was speaking just hours after US vice-president Joe Biden held talks in Brussels with his Afghan counterpart, Mohammad Qasim Fahim."In Afghanistan right now, we see increasing instability and insecurity in the country," Biden told reporters. "That has to be dealt with."Biden went on to say that the US was stepping up support by providing more training and equipment for the Afghan army and police.The Afghan leader also blamed the US for the attacks on Afghan and foreign citizens in the country, which also killed at least three American soldiers.Afghan President Hamid Karzai blamed the US for the attack on the Shi'ite faithful in Kabul, which killed at least 60 people [EPA]The US commander in Afghanistan, General John R. Allen, said it was "the first time this many Shi'ites have been attacked in this period of time since the US has been in Afghanistan".A spokesman for US forces, Major General Rick Lynch, who spoke at a news conference in Kabul, claimed that the US had intelligence that an attack had been planned for this day."It appears that this attack was preplanned and carried out by hostile elements," he said.The Afghan interior ministry says that more than 80 people have been killed so far, but independent figures put the death toll at more than 200.The US military says it has conducted an investigation into the attacks but has offered no evidence.

For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. "Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life," says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer. Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer. "Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be'." In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. "My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else," he says. "I'm used to being in control of everything. I'm in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough." After weeks of tests to determine the "stage" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. "I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery."  Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau's surgery » He swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals. Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. "Leave it all in the pool, and I don't look back and regret anything as far as how I raced." Once back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog. A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer. "They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world," says Shanteau. "They all affect me in a different way and it's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people."	1
but will they count? A day after a federal judge struck down a Michigan state amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman, gay and lesbian couples lined up Saturday to make their unions official. "We never thought that we'd see this day," said Ann Watson, who wed her partner of more than 23 years. "In that sense, it's amazing." Watson -- who works for Turner Broadcasting System, an entity that includes CNN -- and her partner were one of 57 couples to get same-sex marriage licenses in Ingham County, according to county clerk Barb Byrum. Byrum, a Democrat elected to the county clerk post, said that she personally performed 30 ceremonies in Mason. "Today was an awesome day," Byrum tweeted. Not all county clerks followed suit by taking the abnormal step of opening up their offices on a weekend. But there were a few others, such as in Oakland County, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. There, in Pontiac, Frank Colasonti and James Ryder arrived early for the chance to marry after 26 years together. Colasonti told WDIV that "we wanted to get married as soon as possible" in the wake of the court ruling issued late Friday afternoon. Their motivation was simple: "We love each other, and we want to make sure that we protect each other." As to being among the first gay couples married in Michigan, Colasonti said, "It's historic, and we're glad we're a part of it. And we are just happy." There's a chance that their marriage could be among the last, too. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican whose term expires later this year, announced on Friday evening he'd filed an emergency request for U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman's order to be stayed and appealed. "In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable," Schuette said. "Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected." The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order Saturday to temporarily stay through at least Wednesday the decision by Friedman. In its brief order, the court explained that it did so "to allow a more reasoned consideration of the motion to stay."	1
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is under fire for a video showing party-bound fraternity members singing a racist chant. SAE's national chapter suspended the students, but University of Oklahoma President David Boren took it a step further, saying the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done. The news is shocking, but it's not the first time SAE has faced controversy. SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website. When the war began, the group had fewer than 400 members, of which "369 went to war for the Confederate States and seven for the Union Army," the website says. The fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni, along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 "colonies" seeking full membership at universities. SAE has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths, many blamed on the hazing of new recruits, SAE national President Bradley Cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity's website. The fraternity's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for "health and safety incidents" since 2010. At least 30 of the incidents involved hazing, and dozens more involved alcohol. However, the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months. Among them, according to various media outlets: Yale University banned the SAEs from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite. Stanford University in December suspended SAE housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content. And Johns Hopkins University in November suspended the fraternity for underage drinking. "The media has labeled us as the 'nation's deadliest fraternity,' " Cohen said. In 2011, for example, a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption, according to a lawsuit. SAE's previous insurer dumped the fraternity. "As a result, we are paying Lloyd's of London the highest insurance rates in the Greek-letter world," Cohen said. Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.	1
There aren't many people who would voluntarily be pepper-sprayed, but at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia young Marines are doing just that. It's part of their training to protect U.S. embassies around the world. After they get a face full of pepper spray, the Marines must immediately complete a course that includes various defensive obstacles. "We need to have an understanding of what it does," 21-year-old Cpl. Haley Whisenant explained to CNN about 20 minutes after having been sprayed directly in her eyes. "If we were to spray someone and we are contaminated with it as well, we need to know how to contain ourselves," she said. The embassy guard training also includes one-on-one defensive tactics and weapons familiarization. CNN got exclusive access inside the Marine Security Guard training program at Quantico, where Marines are training as the service tries to almost double the number of its members posted at embassies and consulates worldwide. The 2013 Defense Authorization Act, which President Barack Obama signed in January, approves the addition of 1,000 Marines to the current force of 1,200. Plans to increase the size of the force were under way at the time of the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Marine security guards were not assigned to the post in Benghazi when it was attacked, and it is unclear whether Marine guards could have helped or even prevented the attack. Marine security guards are currently posted at embassies and consulates in 137 countries, with a total of 152 compounds being protected. The Corps works directly with the State Department to determine locations Marines will guard. State Department officials recently announced Marine Corps guard protection for approximately 50 additional embassies. "We also will create a quick-response unit that will be able to augment embassy security in case there are indications ... in a particular country ... and that ambassador wants reinforcement with more Marines," Col. Michael Robinson, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, told CNN's Barbara Starr. The Security Augmentation Unit will consist of approximately 100 guards that can be dispatched on a moment's notice. They will be on a "quick tether," according to Robinson. "So instead of requesting through the normal military channels...they would come directly to us, and we would be able to provide this security augmentation unit to help reinforce that particular embassy or consulate," he said.	1
Organs donated by a slain Oakland, California, police officer saved four lives, and his donated tissue will enhance the lives of up to 50 others, the California Transplant Donor Network said Wednesday. Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California. Officer John Hege, 41, was pronounced brain dead on Sunday but was kept on life support pending a decision on organ donation. He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents. "Officer Hege was registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Registry, which his family also supports," the donor network said in a news release. "He chose in death as he did in life to help those in need. His organ donations saved the lives of four adult males from California." Hege's liver, kidneys and heart were donated, the network said, and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday. In a written statement, Hege's family said, "Our son John never met a stranger." "John's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life," the family said in the statement. "In June 2008, he registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry. We completely and proudly support his decision, and it gives us a great deal of comfort to know that four individuals have received the gift of life because of our selfless and beloved John. "Even in death he gave to the lives of those in our community whom he had always loved and supported." Hege had been with the Oakland police force about 10 years. The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said. Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon. The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday in east Oakland, when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a "fairly routine traffic stop," said Dave Kozicki, deputy police chief. Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help, he said. Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force. Dunakin died Saturday.	1
In "Stand Your Ground" Florida, Michael Dunn said he felt threatened by a car full of teens playing loud music and pumped about 10 rounds from his 9 mm pistol into their SUV, killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis.  There were, of course, no return shots, because the teens were unarmed.  Dunn is white, and all the teens in the car were black.  He didn't bother to call the police afterward. Dunn, 47, is on trial, charged with murder. He took the stand Monday, detailing how he was pulled up at a gas station when he asked the teens to turn down the music -- "rap crap" he called it.  Through the teenagers' tinted windows he saw menace, someone reaching for something. "You're not going to kill me, you son of a b***h," Dunn recalled saying as he reached for his loaded gun in his glove box. And he only "stopped firing when it appeared the threat was over." Under Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, which could be used in this case, you are granted immunity from criminal and civil charges -- even if you didn't first try to retreat -- if you can show you had a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm or death. And reasonable is up to interpretation. A 2012 study by The Urban Institute found that in the "Stand Your Ground" states, when white shooters kill black people, "34% of the resulting homicides are deemed justifiable. Only 3% of deaths are ruled justifiable when the shooter is black and the victim is white."  And Dunn feels justified. "I am NOT a murderer," Dunn has said.  Instead, he has taken on the mantle of victimhood and claimed, "I am a survivor." Dunn saw black and Dunn saw "threat."  And he still does. He wrote, while awaiting trial, "This jail is full of blacks, and they all act like thugs. ... This may sound a bit radical, but if more people would arm themselves and kill these **** idiots when they're threatening you, eventually they may take the hint and change their behavior."	1
Mali and Ghana are through to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after both achieved hard-fought quarterfinal victories on Sunday. Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita scored the winning spot-kick for Mali as they defeated co-hosts Gabon 5-4 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes in Libreville. Meanwhile, an extra time winner from Andre Ayew proved enough for World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana to edge past Tunisia 2-1 in the second match in Franceville. Mali will now face Ivory Coast in the last four, while a semifinal showdown with Zambia now awaits Ghana. Gabon looked on course to reach the last four for the first time in their history when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set up Eric Mouloungui for a 55th minute opener. And the scoreline remained that way until six minutes from time when Bordeaux striker Cheick Diabate turned and fired home an equalizer for Mali. With both sides scoring their first four penalties, Gabon's star player Aubameyang saw his spot-kick saved by Mali keeper Soumaila Diakite, leaving Keita to coolly slot home for Mali. Ghana continued their march towards a fifth Africa Cup of Nations title by seeing off a Tunisian side that ended the match with 10 men. Captain John Mensah opened the scoring for Ghana in the 10th minute, when he headed home a left-wing corner. Tunisia leveled three minutes before the break when Evian striker Sabeur Khalifa bravely headed in Zouhaier Dhaouadi's teasing cross from the right. But Ghana secured the victory after 101 minutes when Tunisia goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi dropped a harmless-looking cross for Ayew to roll home from five yards out. And Tunisia's hopes of getting back into the game were effectively ended when Aymen Abdennour was sent off for elbowing Ayew.	1
Arizona investigators have released dramatic video of a Walmart parking lot brawl that left a police officer wounded, one man dead, and reportedly involved members of a Christian family band. Enoch Gaver, 21, was killed in the fight in the town of Cottonwood, and suspect David Gaver, 28, was shot in the stomach and taken into custody.  Police Sergeant Jeremy Daniels was hit in the leg by a bullet fired during the melee. The police dashcam video, released Friday, shows Cottonwood Police approaching the group of eight people -- all identified as members of the Gaver family -- around a large SUV in a Walmart parking lot on March 21. Officers wanted to question them about the alleged assault of a Walmart employee who was going into the store bathroom. The police were accompanied by another Walmart employee. On the video, an officer tells the group that they "need to separate these folks and talk to them." Someone then responds, "No, you are not going to separate me from my parents," and, "don't touch me." The video then shows a police officer being put in a headlock and knocked to the ground. The sound of Taser fire is heard. Police say pepper spray was deployed and that at least three shots were fired in an apparent struggle for an officer's gun. Several times on the video the group appears to surrender, but starts fighting again. The melee goes for several minutes until backup officers arrive and make arrests. Police charged four members of the family with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. Two minors were also taken into custody and are being held at a juvenile detention facility. At least three members of the family are reportedly in a Christian band named "Matthew 24 Now," which is a Bible verse that refers to the end times, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. The family was living out of its Chevy Suburban. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.	1
Killing a 500-plus pound boar might sound like a big deal. But for one North Carolina man, it is just how he brings home the bacon. Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina. When the amazing pictures of the animal and hunter recently circulated on the Internet, Webb started fielding calls from the media. Webb told CNN on Thursday that while many people were astonished by the kill, he shot a boar of a similar size two years ago. Still, friends and family were in awe. "They were blown away. It's not every day you see something that size," Webb said. "They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina." Webb, a firefighter in Conetoe, said the gigantic pig provided so much meat that it filled up his deep freezer. He gave a lot of meat away, but still has "a lot to last me a while." Webb, 34, said hunting isn't about bagging trophies for him. He has been hunting since he was 12 years old and says it relaxes him and provides food for his family. "The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy," he said. Webb and a few other of his fellow hunters at the White Oak Ranch Hunting Club had been tracking the massive hog since January on surveillance cameras they have placed throughout their hunting grounds. They just didn't realize how big a pig this was. On February 28, Webb had been in a tree stand in Bertie County for hours when he spotted the boar and took him down with one shot. Webb said he used an AR-10 with a .308-caliber round. He and a buddy tried to drag the hog out of the woods. That lasted a few feet. They had to go get a four-wheeler to drag it out. The scale only went to 500 pounds. It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds. Michael Mansell, president of the hunting club, told North Carolina Sportsman magazine that he was there when the giant porker was weighed. Wild boar are not native to the United States -- they may have come with Christopher Columbus -- and didn't appear in North Carolina until 1912, the state's Department of Wildlife website says. Their average size is less than 180 pounds, the site says.	1
The Marine Corps has sacked four top officers of a California-based fighter squadron over the December crash of a fighter jet that slammed into a San Diego neighborhood, the service announced Tuesday. Grace Yoon, 15 months, was killed after a military jet crashed into her home. Deferred maintenance and faulty decisions by the pilot and squadron members with whom he was communicating on the ground contributed to the crash, a Marine Corps investigation concluded. The commander of the squadron involved, its top maintenance officer and two others have been relieved of duty as a result of the investigation, and nine other Marines have received other disciplinary action, Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles said. The jet crashed in the University City neighborhood of San Diego, about three miles short of the Miramar airfield. Two adults and two small children from a Korean immigrant family were killed when the jet slammed into their house.  Watch what pilot said as plane had trouble » The F/A-18 Hornet crashed after "a succession of emergencies" that began with oil-pressure problems in its right engine during a flight off the Southern California coast, said Marine Col. John Rupp. That left the jet relying on its other engine, which previously had been giving mechanics electronic indications of a problem with its fuel-flow system, Rupp said.  Learn more about the jet » Maintenance rules don't require immediate repairs for the problem, he said, but the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because its left engine was starved for fuel. "The end result was that the squadron elected to fly an aircraft that had a degraded fuel system on the left side of the aircraft," Rupp said. "This is a critical point, and this was collectively questionable judgment on the part of the squadron's maintenance department." The investigation criticized the pilot, who was being trained on the F/A-18, for not consulting a pocket checklist that outlined emergency procedures. While controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby Navy airfield at North Island, squadron officers relied on "incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data" to guide him back to the plane's base at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. "No one in the ready room stated or understood the severity of the low fuel emergency at this time," Rupp said. "This is a critical moment, and this is collectively bad decision-making by the duty officer, by the operations officer and by the squadron's commanding officer."	1
When we last saw South Carolina Congressman Francis Underwood on Netflix's "House of Cards," he was being offered an appointment to the vice presidency of the United States. How much trouble can that cause? Given what  Underwood has done, it doesn't seem to be a stretch at this point.There are many who would say we, a country in a state of permanent conflict, have little to fear from someone who would be a willing participant in an open-ended war of aggression against America.That was Underwood's message in December, when he offered a new piece of legislation that allows the government to assassinate Americans with no trial nor due process. His proposal is called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and includes various provisions that would expand America's war abroad and militarize domestic law enforcement.Underwood even goes so far as to include a provision that would grant the Department of Homeland Security some responsibility to "oversee and assist law enforcement" after the president has authorized such measures.It is this same kind of logic that underlies President Obama's recent, and likely unconstitutional, amnesty for illegal aliens. We the People have had many opportunities throughout history to weigh the consequences of supporting the government's decisions, yet we too often have refused to do so.For instance, if we voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964, we would have had to accept the decision of Lyndon Johnson to expand the Vietnam War and, as a result, would have had to accept nearly 1.3 million Americans being mowed down and killed in a war that became a global tragedy.Likewise, if we voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, we would have had to accept the decision of Barack Obama to continue and expand the war in Afghanistan, and as a result, to have to accept hundreds of thousands of innocent, mostly Muslim men, women and children.So, what has changed such that we would now vote for someone willing to support and promote an illegal immigration mass amnesty program?Well, for one thing, our nation has more than one party in charge of these political machines. President Obama and Congress have already decided that the party of the American people are those who support their "amnesty plans."In addition, the Republican Party is now in danger of losing its dominant role in the House and Senate: After all, if the Republicans and their leaders continue to support these open-ended amnesty programs, the party will have	0
Serving as a timely reminder to delegates convening for the Rio +20 Earth Summit, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has published its latest Red List detailing the ongoing threats to biodiversity on the Âme of the world's ecosystems and species threatened. Over the past year the organization has carried out a number of initiatives to ensure that the list accurately reflects the current state of many of the world's threatened species. Not only has this list been an essential document for all those holding public hearings on the state of the planet, but it will also become an invaluable resource for delegates at the Rio+20 Conference on sustainable development, which opens in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on June 20th.IUCN's latest list, which represents about 17,000 known threatened and vulnerable species, has an impressive diversity of content. It includes the details of species from over 1,000 families, including those such as the giant panda, the black howler monkey, the black-necked cranesbill orchid, and the red-crowned eagle – all of which have been deemed threatened by IUCN.The organization has also added a new category of threatened species, and an updated category of vulnerable – the former of which now comes under the umbrella of IUCN's most-endangered category, vulnerable. With this update, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species now lists 7,300 species as threatened or vulnerable. This list has been expanded from the 1,250 species that were listed in IUCN's 2004–2006 Red List.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species contains descriptions of the current threats facing each species in terms of habitat loss and overexploitation, and includes such examples as the threats outlined in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species of 2011. The number of species that are listed as threatened has grown substantially since 2004–2006, when the first Red List was issued, which listed only 1,250 species. Though the number of species listed as threatened under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has increased since 2004–2006, they are not considered threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species will be used to establish the IUCN Red List of Vulnerable Species in an effort to protect those species whose populations have declined by more than 95%, though the	0
A rich kid gets pulled over driving a yellow Lamborghini in Miami Beach by police and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence while allegedly street racing. It happens, but when it happens to Justin Bieber, it's icky, weird and potentially career-ending.Bieber, 24, had just finished a concert on Tuesday night in Miami Beach and was getting ready to drive home when he was pulled over for an expired inspection."He was driving with about two pedestrians in the car. They weren't doing anything," said police Sgt. John Corina. "They were just standing in front of the car, which was actually a rental car, which had a rental agreement in it. They were just standing there."According to TMZ, the three were sitting with their legs dangling over the passenger side of the car."They were just like, 'Hey, I'm going to take a picture,' and I was like, 'No, no, no. I'm just going to take a picture,' and they were like, 'Okay,' then they got in the car and drove off," said a witness."There was a lot of yelling and screaming in the distance," the witness added.A witness then told TMZ that Bieber was "flailing" his arms as the patrol car pulled ahead of him."They saw Justin speeding across the street and immediately pulled him over," Corina said.Corina said Bieber was ultimately pulled over for the second time that day, this time for driving without a license plate."This is a little weird here, because they're not supposed to be running red lights or speed limits, but they could see him with his blinker on," he added."At first, they think he just did a light and then they check the registration and make sure he's not a deadbeat. That's about it," he said.All of this, it turns out, is just what happens when you're a pop star with the bad habits of Bieber."I mean, we've got Justin Bieber. He's a young kid, so we've got the police looking for him, so the only thing that's going on here is we're looking for him. We can't do anything to him. We don't care about him," Corina said.Just days after the incident, Bieber posted a	0
Colorado lawmakers on Wednesday approved a bill that would create financial services cooperatives specifically for licensed marijuana businesses in the state. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think the Legislature is just trying to take some of the regulatory and taxation burden out of the people, which is ridiculous,Ã¢â€ said Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Long Beach, sponsor of the measure.Calvert has been a backer of marijuana legalization since he first addressed the issue as a member of the House Criminal Justice Committee. And in the House, he has pushed to enact his proposal.Calvert says that there are several benefits to creating this new cooperative, including providing for increased tax revenue. But he told reporters Wednesday that the cooperative would be modeled after the stateâs agricultural cooperatives, which are not subject to state income tax.âThis is the best way to implement the tax system without taxing the marijuana business,Ã¢â€ Calvert said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a problem with tax. I do have a problem with a tax that has all of the costs from taxing everybody else and then taxing your products. That is stupid.âHe added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a better way to implement a tax system.Ã¢â€He continued: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to save the state money as far as getting the money out of the industry. The industry is going to be getting a return on the investment.Ã¢â‚¬ÂHis bill (SB 1267) also would allow the creation of a so-called marijuana tax credit in which licensed marijuana growers and processors would be eligible to receive up to 5 percent of their sales taxes, based on the amount of gross receipts obtained by the businesses.The California Office of Tax and Fee Administration has stated that the credit will not be available to companies that grow marijuana for recreational use, but any licensed medical marijuana company that produces medical marijuana for those under 19 or those 18 and older with a documented	0
Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev apologized Saturday for referring to Serena and Venus Williams as the "Williams brothers" during a TV chat show. Tarpischev, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has already been carpeted by the WTA for "insulting and demeaning" remarks about the American siblings, being hit with a $25,000 fine and a one-year ban from tennis activities. Tarpischev is the chairman of the Kremlin Cup tournament in Moscow which is finishing this weekend and has held a string of leading positions in sports administration. He made the faux pas on a light night talk show in Russia -- Evening Urgant -- sitting next to former WTA star Elena Dementieva. When the subject of how difficult it was to beat the Williams sisters -- Serena has 18 grand slam titles and Venus seven -- Tarpischev made his controversial comments. After a translation of his remarks became public, the WTA responded immediately and its chief Stacey Allaster pulled no punches. "The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport," she said. "I have ordered Mr. Tarpischev to be fined $25,000, the maximum allowed under WTA rules. In addition, he will be suspended from any involvement with the WTA for one year and we are seeking his removal from his position as Chairman of the Board of the Kremlin Cup for one year." Tarpischev claimed he had not intended to insult the sisters and that his remarks were light hearted. "Serena and Venus (Williams) are without doubts outstanding athletes," he said in a statement released by Russia's tennis federation. "The situation that has spontaneously emerged during the late night chat show had a bad influence on the perception of tennis in general and splits our friendly and cohesive team. "I'm sorry that the joke which was taken out of context and attracted so much attention," he added. Tarpischev's U.S. counterpart David Haggerty, the president of the USTA, was angered by the remarks and issued a strongly worded condemnation.	1
Through the unrelenting rain, with the biting winds whipping against her tear-stained face, Christine Kim stands on the cold, gray harbor. "Inside that water," she says, pointing to the choppy waves on the ipsilateral side of the harbor. "That water. That water," she repeats, waving her arms to make her point, "is my home," she says, as she looks at every sailboat, every kayak, every canoe, every stand-up paddleboard, every kayak, every canoe, every stand-up paddleboard, every sailboat, every kayak, every canoe, every stand-up paddleboard, every kayak, every canoe, every stand-up paddleboard, every kayak, it seems, from her house to the next.For the past five years, Kim has lived in a one-room apartment on Mercer Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of New York City. When she moved back in with her mother as recently as a year ago, she took up residence in a three-bedroom apartment on the same street, and so she now has two apartments—one for her and one for her mother. The apartments cost her about $900 per month, which she has had to pay for as she has had to live on food stamps and, more recently, with the assistance of a small government program called Section 8—which she thinks is so "unfair" because one person is allowed to receive aid to live with a certain number of people but not others. To make matters even more complicated, Kim's boyfriend is in the military, and they have been living together for the last year, so to have to find a new place for her is difficult for her. "I'm really concerned about how I will afford to live through the next year," she says. "I'm tired of paying people for houses and taking in people on Section 8."Kim is one of a growing number of young adults who are struggling. New research by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has shown that between 1999 and 2013, more than 30 percent of twenty-two to thirty-four year-olds have not received a college degree. In New York State, in 2013 alone, more than 4,000 students were forced to leave school early due to homelessness. In some of these cases, the students' parents could have enrolled them in schools but did not, and their enrollment waivers were canceled. "Parents have been	0
Voldemort did not die in vain. Ralph Fiennes may have dedicated a good part of the last decade to torturing Harry Potter, but he's also found the time, the energy and the clout to pull off his first film as director. By any standards, "Coriolanus" is an ambitious undertaking, a modern-day interpretation of one of Shakespeare's meatiest but less frequently performed plays. Although not everything comes off, Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge. Set in "Some place calling itself Rome," but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, "Coriolanus" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes. Gen. Caius Martius (Fiennes) returns triumphant from vanquishing archenemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and the Volsces from their stronghold, Corioles, and takes on the name of this, his most famous victory. But an attempt to make him consul, or head of state, alarms some senators who know his contempt for ordinary civilians. While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as "Coriolanus," must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market. Too proud to court public opinion, he goes through the motions, but when his enemies turn the crowd against him, his fury only makes matters worse and the general is banished from Rome. Alone and angry, he swears vengeance and offers his services to Aufidius. As in other modern-dress Shakespearean adaptations, there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production, which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights. The notion of the warrior-hero who can carry battles single-handedly doesn't really jibe with modern warfare, and it's been a while since we had a military man as president. Shakespeare's play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield, it's no qualification for success in politics. Coriolanus is undone by his own peculiar integrity, a refusal to exploit his war record for votes; but only because he finds the democratic process demeaning -- he's a pure elitist, the kind of person who believes that birthright is destiny. In power, he'd be a disaster.	1
As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is "mad, frustrated and angry." Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate, frustrated that he's running out of time to fix it and angry that he's got a second-term agenda now going nowhere. He's so furious, in fact, that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides, saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess. By Thursday, the president was venting publicly. "Had I been informed, I wouldn't be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I'm accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I'm stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn't going to work." All of which begs the real question: How could he not have known? It's a real head-scratcher. Most powerful man in the world. Most important issue. Most politically explosive, particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown. Consider the context: Republicans had just tried to defund Obamacare, and they lost in a heap of public humiliation. So the rollout of Obamacare had to be really impressive, because the Republicans had to be proven wrong. And yet, as the dry runs continued to produce red flags -- over and over -- the President remained in his steely cocoon. If this were the presidency of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, the obvious theories would abound: The chief executive is disengaged. Or incurious. Or worse. But since Obama is none of the above, what gives? This much is clear, after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials: No one was really in charge, so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was. What's more, and -- perhaps most telling -- no one wanted even to hint to the President that this techno-savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in, say, 1995. "People don't like to tell him bad news," says an ex-White House staffer. "Part of it is the no-drama culture."	1
A rash of bank robberies in New York has the city's police commissioner worried that criminals have turned banks into "virtual cash machines" and some wondering whether tough economic times are fueling the trend. A surveillance camera ?"One of New York's three major credit unions announced this week that it will no longer offer credit-card accounts for the purchase of cash."The last thing we want is for the credit union to become a cash outlet," said New York City Comptroller John Liu, who chairs the state's banking regulator, the Department of Financial Services. "Banks are supposed to be banks again."In the United States, banks have long offered Visa and MasterCard for payment with checks or money orders. This year, however, the National Retail Federation is challenging banks to offer its member banks an alternative, a high-interest prepaid debit card.Although some banks have experimented with alternatives for cash and electronic transactions, a growing number of big banks have shut off the cash option.That has become increasingly true in New York, where the city's Comptroller's Office estimated that banks lost about 2,700 deposits a day last year to customers withdrawing cash at ATMs during non-business hours.When a robbery happens, the city's law-enforcement agencies are left to determine what happens next based on the information they get from witnesses.Police are particularly concerned by robberies that occur in areas frequented by businesspeople, in areas where they know businesses are likely to have a large ATM footprint, or at branches that hold an unusually high number of accounts, the commissioner said."These are the kinds of crimes that we're trying to catch at a higher rate."In the last three days, city police issued more than 800 summonses for "loitering," a misdemeanor that's become more likely as the economy has soured."This is all part of a pattern that's occurring," said Peter Roth, a police spokesman. "The general business is down, people are going to the ATM and withdrawing money, and what's happening is there are more bank robberies. When there's more robberies, there's more money being taken from people."Roth said New York City's major banks are cooperating with law enforcement in all cases. The banks, which have a combined deposit of $3.9 trillion and an $18 billion operating capital, have not closed branches or cut back on ATM	0
Violent crime in the United States fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2011 with murder, rape and robbery all going down, although crime remains a serious problem in many urban areas, the FBI said on Monday. The report of all crimes reported to police nationwide showed slightly more than 1.2 million violent incidents nationwide, while property crimes hit a nine-year low. Compared with 2010, the new figures show violent crime down 3.8 percent overall. Property crime was down 0.5 percent. Among violent incidents reported to police, murders were down about 0.7 percent, robberies dropped 4 percent, aggravated assaults declined 3.9 percent, and forcible rapes were down 2.5 percent. Despite the positive trend, crime remains a serious problem in many urban pockets riddled with gangs, drugs, and poverty. There were 14,612 murders last year, on average one every 36 minutes.  That's a small decline from 14,722 in 2010, but it's a decrease of nearly 17 percent from a decade ago. Most victims were male and in cases where race was known, 50 percent were black and 46 percent were white. Statistics showed 514 murders in New York and 431 in Chicago. Guns were used in two thirds of the nation's murders last year, 41 percent of robberies, and 21 percent of aggravated assaults, the report showed. The closely watched Uniform Crime Reports do not include explanations for the consolidated figures, and the FBI does not comment on the data. However, criminologists point to a variety of factors for the continuing decline in overall violence. They cite a more settled crack cocaine market, an increase in incarcerations, an aging population, data-driven policing, and changes in technology that include a big increase in surveillance cameras. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said crime has continued to decline from a peak in the 1990s but now is decreasing at a slower rate. "I call it the limbo stick effect," Fox said. " You can only go so low. You're never going to get down to zero crime." The FBI crime statistics differed from a telephone crime survey released by the Justice Department early this month. That report actually showed crime increasing last year, but attributed the change to a jump in simple assaults. Fox said many of those assaults described to interviewers were non-injury pushing and shoving incidents not reported to any law enforcement agencies.	1
The U.S. Air Force is breaking out some of its heaviest hardware to send a message to North Korea. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that B-52 bombers are making flights over South Korea as part of military exercises this week in an attempt to bolster deterrence against North Korean aggression. The Pentagon also said that the U.S. military is planning to deploy the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea to protect key U.S. interests in the Pacific over the next 12 years. "The deployment of these assets to South Korea is a clear message to North Korea that Washington is deeply committed to defending its allies and the territory of its allies, and also to standing up to the threat posed by North Korea," Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said in a statement.More than 30 anti-government protesters were shot and killed in Mexico City on Saturday, the country's most deadly day since a July 1, 2018 mass jailbreak.

A typo kept President Barack Obama from signing legislation designed to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays, a congressional source told CNN. But the fix is going into effect anyway, and the system will be back to normal by Sunday, the FAA said. The holdup was caused by an "s" missing from uses of the word "accounts." The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts to prevent having to furlough controllers. But the way the Senate version of the bill read would have limited the source of funds to an "account." The House fixed the typo in the version it passed Friday, and the Senate plans to fix it Tuesday, a senior House GOP aide told CNN. The FAA "is not impacted," the source said. The FAA issued a statement Saturday, saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and that "the system will resume normal operations by Sunday evening." Read more: House OKs measure designed to end controller furloughs The story was first reported by ABC News. In rare bipartisan accord, normally quarrelsome U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports. The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts. It also allows authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. Five things to know about FAA furloughs Since Sunday, more than 3,000 flights had been delayed because of the furloughs, the FAA said. The furloughs were unavoidable, the agency said, because it lacked the flexibility to avert them without action by Congress. The furloughs affected some 15,000 FAA air traffic controllers. Cost-cutting measures such as the furloughs and the planned closures of towers that are privately run or overseen by federal aviation regulators have become part of the debate on government spending. They have been highlighted by many to illustrate a clear nationwide consequence of the $85 billion in government-wide cuts that took effect in March and may otherwise not be apparent to the public. Many Democrats miffed FAA cuts were reversed without concessions CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.	1
Apple sue us next? Not a chance. That's the gist of Google's message following Apple's $1 billion victory over Samsung in a California patent suit. The search giant is doing its best to quell fears that its Android operating system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is being embraced by millions of new mobile owners Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will threaten its dominance in the software market.Google has repeatedly said that it takes its legal obligations very seriously. That means nothing less than that it will not cave without getting the best possible deal.If you don't believe that, take a look at the statement Google made in response to Apple's victory yesterday. Google makes it clear that it isn't worried about a hostile Android invasion of its software market."We're happy that the appeals court decision has been upheld and that courts have continued to uphold patent law," reads Google's statement. "The appeals court found that Apple did not meet its burden to show that Android infringed any of the Samsung patent claims. This is important in the context of what we view as a growing number of patent lawsuits in which Android does not infringe any patent at issue. We are also happy that the judge made clear that there's no question that Apple's patent portfolio should not be broadened by this decision. And we're thankful to those who stood up at the court to make that point."This is, of course, a direct response to Apple's threat yesterday that it will seek to enforce its patent victories by suing over the next two years. Google's response makes clear that it has no such intention.The question is not whether Apple has the legal means to enforce its patents on its own. Google says it has none when it comes to Android, and won't attempt to do so. It's the question of when and how Google does so that is the issue."We have consistently said that we don't take ourselves out of the intellectual marketplace based on our competitors' behavior," Google's statement reads. "To do so is to take away the incentive of innovators, both domestic and foreign. There is no doubt that Apple has a legitimate case that requires careful examination and a fair hearing. And we will work with Apple at the highest levels to ensure that our industry stays on track while they review their patent portfolio."It remains to be seen if Apple takes Google to	0
Think of President Barack Obama's pivot from last week's anemic job growth numbers to Monday's populist call to lower taxes for the middle class as the political equivalent of shifting an awkward dinner party conversation to a rousing comment Ã¢Â€Â” what if.In order to understand the president's strategy on taxes, we need to look back to his second inaugural address.In that address, Obama called for "a new national security strategy that prevents new conflicts, that reduces incentives for provocative behavior, and that refines our moral compass to focus on our common interests."This is a bold, ambitious goal, but the president has long said he doesn't believe the U.S. military is ready for an open world. He wants to shift our resources to the world after America.And even under the most optimistic scenarios, America's global interests still won't be served by a huge army of soldiers and sailors in distant lands. No one in their right mind would want that.So Obama's strategy Ã¢Â€Â” he says it's a strategy Ã¢Â€Â” has two parts:Step 1: We'll give America's global military institutions an important new role that they have not had for the past 70 years or more Ã¢Â€Â” to make sure that terrorists and rogue regimes don't get weapons of mass destruction. He wants to send the Marines, and also send the Army, to the Middle East and Africa so that they can take on terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and groups that pose a threat from Russia, China, Iran and the Islamic State. This means sending boots on the ground and a combat force to protect American interests. America's global military institutions are designed to meet these requirements, but they are not well-equipped to do so Ã¢Â€Â” just like our forces were not equipped to defeat the Nazis or to fight the Soviets or other communist countries.Step 2: In return, America will not have to spend money on the military.The president doesn't buy into the idea that we should give up some of our liberties and we'll have a smaller military, but he does believe that the U.S. government should not be on the front line of a new and very costly war.And that means that we need to get back to normalcy in order to prevent another World War III,	0
In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt. Google and Apple basically told the CTIA to stuff it -- they're sticking with their own rating schemes. "We've put a lot of effort into Android Market's rating system, which now works well globally," Google spokesman Christopher Katsaros said in a statement. "While we support other systems, we think it's best for Android users and developers to stick with Android's existing ratings." Apple, too, has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail, but has not publicly commented on the CTIA app rating issue. In the Android Market, Google assigns content ratings that range from "Everyone" to "Low Maturity" to "High Maturity," but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings. However, outlines for the ratings are provided in Google's Android Market support forum. In its App Store, Apple provides an age rating ranging from 4+ to 17+, and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating. For instance Plants vs Zombies received a 9+ rating for Infrequent/Mild Horror/Fear Themes and Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence. The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content. The ratings, which would be controlled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings) would range from "Everyone" to "Adults Only." Apple's App Store alone has more than half a million apps and Android is getting close to that number with at least 300,000. CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March. The initiative would call for "voluntary self-certification of apps." The system would make it easier for parents to see -- regardless of mobile platform -- if an app was appropriate for their child. The mobile application rating system was officially announced on Tuesday. AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile USA, U.S. Cellular and Microsoft are the founding bodies of the age-appropriateness rating system.	1
Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of Michael Jackson's children. Katherine Jackson has Â¡totally Â¡taken over Â¡tÂ¡t the judge's life! Â¡tÂ¡tWANT TO SEE MORE? Â¡uMUST READÂ¡Â¡uAs The Sun reports, Michael Jackson's children are to hear a final decision from Judge Steve Jones in court tomorrow afternoon. That's right, Judge Jones, who is already facing charges of obstruction of justice of a sort, just turned down Michael Jackson's request for some control over his estate. I know, but I told you that he was guilty and now you will want to see what this judge did.The singer's legal battle against the estate has been running since 1993 after he became too ill to do his work.Michael has been fighting for control of his children's bank accounts for the past 16 years."The decision will not change my love for Michael, the men & women of the Jackson family, or the millions of fans all over the world who stand by them," he said, according to Page Six magazine. "It is my hope that my children and all of my fans will be able to understand and accept the decision and move on with their lives." He said the decision will give him time to devote to his kids.The judge will decide whether Katherine and John can live under the same roof with Michael in New York with the condition that they have separate bedrooms.I know what you're thinking, you're thinking that this is a silly reason to keep a child's home, a child's home should be a child's home and not a family home, blah blah blah blah blah blah.How many times must we tell you that Michael's children are innocent. It's not that complicated. And we will explain this to you, the minute the judge rules that he is in control of his children's lives and that is the reason that they are being kept in this insane situation."The ruling will not change anything for the children," said Katherine's attorney, Bill Gerber. "They've already been through the roller coaster. It's not like Michael will be home all the time." Ger	0
In a critical indication of growing U.S. military involvement in the civil war in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the deployment of more American troops to Jordan. Hagel announced the deployment, which will involve a total of approximately 4,500 militarily trained soldiers. They will be deployed to Jordan and will be responsible for assisting in the operations of the U.S. Northern Command in support of the civil war. The deployment is not limited to a one-time deployment.The deployment will be in addition to U.S. troops already in Jordan, including 4,700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, and 2,100 troops from the 10th Mountain Division. Another 500 U.S. troops will be stationed in Iraq to train the Iraqi security forces. Another 1,200 troops will be based in Kuwait to increase the U.S. presence there.Hagel has also ordered the deployment of another 10,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan in support of U.S. efforts there, where the U.S. military is increasing the number of troops there by about 3,000 per month.See also List of American military bases outside the United States List of United States Marine Corps installations United States involvement in the Arab–Israeli conflict American military strength in the Middle East List of American television networks and stations based outside the United StatesReferencesFurther reading  Category:Bases of United States military basesCategory:United States Marine Corps basesCategory:United States Military Base SystemCategory:United States Navy installationsCategory:Buildings and structures in JordanCategory:United States Marine Corps in the 20th centuryCategory:Military installations in the State of KuwaitCategory:Military installations of the United States in IraqCategory:Military bases in JordanCategory:Installations of the United States Army in the Middle EastCategory:Bases of the United States Air Force in Saudi ArabiaCategory:Units and installations of the United States Marine Corps in the Gulf WarCategory:Bases in KuwaitCategory:Bases in IraqCategory:Military installations established in 2013Category:2013 establishments in KuwaitCategory:2013 establishments in Iraq	0

There had to be a witness, but, unless it could be established that the record was in the hands of one person, nobody could say for sure that any record existed.The second was simply the nature of the record. For a moment, with a gasp of disbelief, they all wondered who might have written down all that stuff they had just heard.The more the group thought about it, however, the more perplexed they became. Who would write a record like that? Who would even have the interest?  A very good question, of course, but one that, for the moment, was less important. If they couldn't identify the record-keeper, what was the use of worrying about the nature of the record?For the moment, though, the fact remained that there was no record, no way to prove that any record existed. Any official record would necessarily carry a signature and be authenticated by someone."We could take the trouble to find the signature,  and we certainly could take the trouble to read the book ourselves,  but then we would have to prove the authenticity of the book,  and if that's ever going to be proved, we have to do it ourselves."—PUNYUANIt was like trying to prove that the earth was flat.

Imagine a woman dying under a rain of stones while buried in the ground to the top of her breasts. Imagine faceless figures throwing stones at her. Imagine her last thoughts, wishes and dreams. Imagine her hoping to magically survive this ills. She was a princess.She lived in a distant kingdom in an area known as The Forest. The King was blind and lived in an oak tree with his wife and three children. The princess always wanted to live in The Forest but there were no trees in The Forest. She also wanted to marry a man in the kingdom. One day, an evil wizard tricked her and killed her husband to make her his wife. The wizard then put poison in her cup and sent her to the bottom of The Forest to die. When she came to the top of the mountain, she was surprised to see an oak tree with a gold crown on it. The tree was guarded by a black cat named Noodle. The tree had a message written on it. The message said, "If you want to live in the Forest, give the princess your heart."An old man lived a long time in The Forest and he had a magic wand. He loved the princess. He was very wise and had lived a long and good life. The princess looked at the sword and asked if he could make her a sword. The old man said he would try, but he would need to find the right wood and grind it with all the other old things. He needed to make her a sword that could cut the heart out of a man's chest. He told her the sword needed to have a hole in the front, like a chest, and he would need a blade in the back and a hilt on the right side. He put the sword on his lap and showed it to the princess.The wizard made the princess a golden cup of water. She was afraid to drink it but was too curious. She tasted it and it tasted like blood. The princess knew that the wizard intended to poison her. She took the sword and held it in her hand. It was light as a feather and very sharp. The sword could cut through anything. She knew she had to save the princess before she drank the poison in the cup. She told the old man, "Take me to The Forest so I can die there."

Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of Michael Jackson's children. Katherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son's estate of "keeping her in the dark." Dozens of lawyers are expected to pack a Los Angeles courtroom where a judge will consider the Jackson family matriarch's challenge of the lawyer and former music executive who were named as executors in Michael Jackson's will. Katherine Jackson's lawyers filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being "intent on keeping her in the dark" about deals they've made or are negotiating. Londell McMillan, Jackson's lead attorney, raised questions about "a suspicious circle of relationships" involving John Branca, the singer's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff gave Branca and McClain temporary control of the estate until Monday's hearing. Katherine Jackson is asking the judge to order Branca, McClain and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are "fit and able" to administer the estate. The men also were served with a 19-page demand for documents. Branca has refused to let Katherine Jackson see Michael Jackson's contracts with AEG -- the company that was organizing and promoting his planned concerts -- unless she agrees to keep them confidential. Branca's lawyer argued in a court filing that he has no choice, since the contracts have a provision requiring confidentiality. Branca's lawyers also argued that Jackson's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome. "Such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate," McMillan said. McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The will written in 2002 places all of Michael Jackson's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. Judge Beckloff will consider at Monday's hearing who will have permanent control of the estate.	1
Robin Stearns, 28, watched her husband apply for jobs day in and day out. She watched him scour professional networking sites in an attempt to contact prospective employers. Robin Stearns created a Web site to draw employers' attention to her jobless husband, Michael. No response. Then an idea came to her: Why not make him stand out by starting a Web site devoted to helping him find a job? She used her tax refund to buy a MacBook, which came with a Web site building feature. A few days later, myhusbandneedsajob.com was born. "I grew frustrated. He has been sending out resumes since he graduated but nothing has happened," the San Francisco, California, resident said. "He's such a great candidate, he would be an asset to any company." Michael Stearns, 30, earned his master's in business administration from Georgetown University in Washington in May 2008. He says he is "basically looking to get into a corporate marketing environment" but is willing to try anything reasonable. The site features a picture of Robin Stearns holding a sign begging for somebody to employ her husband. It also displays his resume and a profile interview and other features. As the economy tumbles and unemployment rates soar, the jobless are using creativity to make themselves stand out. Paul Forster, co-founder and CEO of the job search site Indeed.com, urges candidates to employ measures that separate them from the masses rather than blanketing the job market with resumes. "Don't resort to the shotgun approach," Forster advises.  Watch adults crash a teen job fair » The Internet has given job seekers an extra tool to reach out to employers. Social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook are filled with public groups that share tips on job openings. Blogs focusing on support for the jobless are plentiful, too, helping people realize they are not alone. For the Stearnses, defying a pack mentality and using a different approach seems to have made a difference. The site, which has been up for about three days, has brought dozens of e-mails from both employers and other people in a similar situation. Michael Stearns said he plans to follow up on the job opportunities. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, California has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates at 10.1 percent. The national rate is 8.1 percent.	1

Every day, more than 3,200 kids under the age of 18 smoke a cigarette for the first time. About 700 of those become daily smokers. Those are two reasons, the Food and Drug Administration says, why it has launched a national education campaign aimed at preventing those between the ages of 12 and 17 from trying cigarettes or -- for those already experimenting -- from becoming regular smokers. "The Real Cost" campaign seeks to educate these "at-risk" teenagers by spotlighting the health hazards of smoking in a series of television, radio, print and online ads. These ads show the costs of smoking, from skin damage to gum disease and from tooth loss to a loss of control over their lives because of from addiction. About nine of 10 regular smokers had their first cigarettes by the time they were 18, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. Because teenage brains are still developing, they are more susceptible to nicotine addiction, the FDA said. "We know from research that there is a group of of youth -- 12 to 17 -- who are more vulnerable, partly because of the nature of their lives -- you know, chaotic lives, lots of stress, lack of control," Hamburg said. Some live with smokers, "which dramatically increases the risk, and so we're hoping that we can potentially interrupt a deadly cycle," she said. "We can help these teens understand the real consequences of smoking, the real costs of smoking to them, so that they won't take up smoking if they're on the cusp and will stop smoking if they've already started." E-cigarettes: Healthy tool or gateway device? Smoking as an adolescent can stunt growth, stain teeth and cause premature wrinkles, health officials say, and smokeless tobacco can cause mouth, esophagus and pancreas cancers. Studies have estimated that every cigarette smoked shaves 11 minutes off your life. In 2009, the Tobacco Control Act became law, giving the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health, including manufacturing, distribution and marketing. The law looks to prevent and reduce smoking by kids under 18, the legal age to buy tobacco products. These new ads are the first of several planned education campaigns, but it's not the only effort. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuing its "Tips From Former Smokers" campaign with a new set of anti-smoking ads.	1
President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Sunday for a three-day trip centered on an international nuclear security summit in Seoul. He flew into Seoul, where he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with his South Korean counterpart Lee Myung-bak. Top officials from 54 countries, including China and Russia, will attend the summit meeting on Monday and Tuesday. But its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by North Korea's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in April. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March. President Lee has already said he will use the summit to drum up international support against the actions of his northern neighbor. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) cited a spokesman from the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea as denouncing the South for working to turn the summit "into a platform for (an) international smear campaign" against the North. The North has a right to a nuclear deterrent and to conduct a "satellite launch for peaceful purposes," the committee's statement said, and will take "counter-measures" if the South stirs up international criticism of its actions. Against that tense backdrop, Obama is scheduled on Sunday to visit for the first time the demilitarized zone that splits the Korean Peninsula in two. He will also meet with some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, two of his top national security advisers said Tuesday during a conference call. Although Obama himself has not been to the demilitarized zone during his two previous trips to South Korea as president, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid a visit to the area in 2010. And Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, used binoculars to peer into North Korea from a sandbagged bunker on the southern side of the border in 2002. The date of Obama's visit " is virtually two years to the day" since the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which left 46 Southern sailors dead, said Daniel Russel, director for Japan, South Korea, and North Korea at the U.S. National Security Council.	1
Schadenfreude -- joy at the misfortune of others -- is a bad thing. So I've been trying to resist temptation these past months as I watch Attorney General Eric Holder deal with public and congressional reaction to the "Fast and Furious" scheme, the failed attempt  to track the flow of illegal weapons across the border into the hands of violent drug cartel assassins who murdered a US border patrol agent.First, Holder's efforts to distance himself and the Justice Department from the agency that investigated the shooting miss the point. Yes, Holder was the one who had to decide whether or not to appoint a special prosecutor, and he made all the right decisions. But that doesn't mean he needs to pretend that he was the victim of partisan political pressures. Like it or not, the Bush administration had a lot of clout with the Justice Department, and, more important, the president himself.What Holder should have said was, "My job is to defend the Department of Justice, and its work to protect Americans from criminals intent on harming them." To that end, Congress should be asking him to appoint a special prosecutor who can investigate the Bush administration's mismanagement of the Fast and Furious program, and make sure that no one in this administration or any other administration -- Republican or Democrat -- ever again attempts to weaponize the investigative arm of the Justice Department.What's clear now is not only that the department's political appointees in Washington did a poor job of policing their department, but that the department itself was poorly run for most of the past eight years. The department's political appointees got their way on the decision to investigate a border shooting, and the department's management failed to correct the problems -- many of which were obvious. Instead, they were given an outsized role in the investigation of the shooting and given a pass to do their work.And if you want to go back to a more Bush-era example, you can't ignore the fact that the Justice Department's inspector general was given an extraordinarily large role in the Fast and Furious investigation, and that the inspector general had been told not to discuss the investigation with the White House or Congress. So the IG had the opportunity to be a witness against his own officers. It was a terrible misstep.

Two lawsuits say the national chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity allowed a culture of "violent misogyny" after an internal email from the Georgia Tech chapter leaked last year instructing fraternity members on how to lure "rapebait." The  Georgia Tech students sued the national fraternity's national headquarters in February, after they say the email was distributed to national chapters.Tatum Hodge, an associate professor of women's studies and media studies at Georgia Tech, was one of the students who sued the national fraternity. In the suit, Hodge, a writer and activist, says the email was circulated to all the fraternity's chapters, as well as its national offices, and "is being used as a weapon in a culture of violence against women."The suit alleges the incident in April 2010 was "part of a culture of violence and hatred against women at Georgia Tech as well as in the fraternity houses at Georgia Tech and around the country. The email and other emails reveal a culture of misogyny and anti-feminist ideology."Tatum Hodge wasn't the first to report on the email. In June, the same students filed a lawsuit against the Georgia Tech chapter of Phi Kappa Tau. The lawsuit says the national chapter instructed the fraternity on how to deal with "rape-baiting" -- how to attract members of the opposite sex, and how to lure them into a sexual encounter with a new member.Hodge and her husband, William, both of whom are gay, say they witnessed the culture of "violence and hatred against women" firsthand at Georgia Tech -- and that it extends beyond the campus. They say they were approached by other students after reading about the Phi Kappa Tau email, and that they found the culture to be "pervasive.""The culture is so prevalent here in my department and in the university that I have not been able to take it personally," says Hodge. "I've seen it in the students. I've observed it on the football team, I've observed it on the debate team, I've observed it in student government and in the other fraternities."The suit comes at a time when U.S. colleges and universities are under pressure to address student culture, or else risk a backlash.In June, President Obama proposed a five-year plan to reduce the number of reported sexual assaults on college campuses. During the presidential campaign, he said he would "make college campuses a little	0
The United States needs to formulate an "updated strategy" for Iraq, now that the Bush administration's 18-month game plan for the country is completed, the head of the Government Accountability Office told lawmakers Wednesday. U.S. soldiers crouch at their positions during a mission in  Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, earlier this month. Acting U.S. Comptroller General Gene L. Dodaro appeared before a House Armed Services Committee hearing to discuss last month's GAO progress report on Iraq, which reaffirmed the need for a renewed strategy in the war-ravaged country. The report, Dodaro said in prepared remarks, noted that "some gains" have been made in the security, legislative and economic areas since President Bush last year announced "The New Way Forward" -- the near-term goals for Iraq that included the military surge. The surge, or troop escalation, ended this month. "The United States had made some progress in achieving key goals stated in 'The New Way Forward,' " the report said. "Looking forward, many challenges remain, and an updated strategy is essential." Dodaro said the progress report recommended an updated strategy in Iraq to the Departments of State and Defense. He told lawmakers that the departments said they will "review and refine the current strategy as necessary, but asserted that 'The New Way Forward' remains valid." Dodaro also argued that a renewed strategy is important "for several reasons." The goals and objectives for the present phase end this month and they are "contained in disparate documents rather than a single strategic plan," he said in his prepared remarks. "Much has changed in Iraq since January 2007, when the president announced 'The New Way Forward.' Violence is down, U.S. surge forces are leaving, and a new framework for the U.S. presence in Iraq needs to be agreed upon beyond the U.N. mandate," Dodaro said. The GAO report said that while the number of enemy-initiated attacks in Iraq have decreased about 80 percent from June 2007 to June 2008, the "security environment remains volatile and dangerous." The agency noted that not all of the country's provinces have lead responsibility for security and less than 10 percent of Iraqi security forces "were at the highest readiness level."	1
From street corners, buses and subways to phone calls, e-mails, text messages, online posts and tweets, people around the world commented, pondered, and paid tribute to pop legend Michael Jackson, who died Thursday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three days short of his 56th birthday.One of the most influential artists of all time, Jackson was recognized for his music, his philanthropy and his humanitarian work. The entertainer is widely credited with popularizing the use of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“boyÃ¢â‚¬Â as a name for a young person.Jackson was born in Rochester, Minn. He signed his first contract at age 17 with his family-owned record label, Reprise Records, and made his debut in 1974 at age 20 with the single, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.He went on to release 25 albums in all, including Thriller, Bad, Off the Wall, Bad Again and Dangerous, which was the soundtrack to the 1997 film of the same name and became the best-selling LP of all time. Jackson sang a single on the album, "Billie Jean," but the track did not make the final cut.Michael Jackson, the artist who pioneered pop music and helped to redefine what it means to be a musical performer, has died at age 50, the Associated Press (AP) reported early Sunday. It's the third reported death of an artist in three days.There's little question that Michael Jackson's name is synonymous with the music industry and more broadly, with popular culture. More and more, fans are comparing Jackson to popular movie stars like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, who have been honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and who have also died this summer. But there's also a counter-argument to be made: Jackson's work lives on. And we are all in his debt.As a matter of fact, he's a walking museum. Here are all the things he did in the music business, from signing the most recent record deal to getting his face on posters:It's called the Summer of Thriller.From a single to his latest album, Thriller, and then his latest single, "Thriller," the music world lost one of its all-time stars	0
Before making judgments about the shootings at Fort Hood, a thorough investigation needs to take place, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday. "It is imperative that we take the time to gather all the facts, as it would be irresponsible to be the source of rumors or inaccurate information regarding such a horrific event," Cornyn said in a statement. "Once we have ascertained all the facts, working with our military leaders and law enforcement officials on the ground, we can determine what exactly happened at Fort Hood today and how to prevent something like this from ever happening again," he said. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, shot and killed 11 soldiers and one civilian, officials said. Thirty-one people were wounded, officials at the Army base said. A federal official said Hasan is a U.S. citizen of Jordanian descent. Cornyn, a Republican, said people should not jump to conclusions about what happened and why. "We do not yet have these details," the statement said. President Obama, who was speaking at a conference in Washington, said his administration "will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident." He asked Americans to keep the soldiers and families of Fort Hood in the thoughts and prayers. Former President George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000 and lives in Crawford about 20 miles from the post, expressed his family's sorrow. "I was saddened to learn of the tragic incident at Fort Hood. Laura and I are keeping the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time," he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video Two prominent Muslim organizations condemned the shootings. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in Washington, said there was no reason for such violence. "We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest terms possible and ask that the perpetrators be punished to the full extent of the law," a statement from the organization said. "No political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence." The Muslim Public Affairs Council offered its sympathy to the victims and their families. "MPAC and the Muslim American community unequivocally condemn this heinous incident," said a statement from the Los Angeles, California, based group. "Our entire organization extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed as well as to those wounded and their loved ones." The group said it was working with law enforcement and government officials.	1
It all starts on the sixth floor of the five-star Lotte Hotel, in the center of Seoul. After booking my place for Panmunjom Travel Center's Combined Tour, I show up at the agency office at 7:45 on a chilly Friday morning in December to begin my adventure. A model of a Republic of Korea soldier stands guard in front of a footbridge that dead-ends at the DMZ. Our destination for the day is the DMZ -- or the "heavily fortified" Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. Passport and conservative attire are required on the day -- this is not a do-it-yourself tour. Four kilometers (2.8 miles) wide, 240 km long and roughly 55 km north of Seoul, the DMZ was created on July 27, 1953, following the Armistice Agreement that ended three years of fighting, if not the war itself. Half a century later, the untouched buffer zone between the Koreas has evolved into a highly protected ecological sanctuary, home to several rare species of plant and wildlife, including whooper cranes and white herons. As the tour bus makes its way northward along the "Freedom Highway," the guides brief us on the infiltration tunnels dug by the North Korean army with the intention to covertly invade Seoul and take over South Korea. Since Kim Il Sung's combat order to dig them in 1971, four such tunnels have been discovered respectively in 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1990. The third tunnel, 75 meters deep and the closest to Seoul, is the one we are scheduled to visit. Our first stop is Paju, a small city bordering the DMZ, full of ominous symbols that double as tourist distractions leading up to the heart of the border-line tension. A sheltered peace bell, a footbridge that dead-ends into a barbed-wire fence, an exhibition of military vehicles and missiles employed during the war, the trans-Korean "Iron Horse" train stopped dead in its tracks and an abandoned amusement park are just some of the attractions that greet visitors to Paju on their way to the real danger zone. Unfortunately, after our extended visit, we learn that the previous night's snowfall has left the road to the Western Frontline dangerously slippery and closed until further notice. In short, our Third Infiltration Tunnel tour has been canceled.	1
Early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts Friday, as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley in more than 70 years. In Tunica, Mississippi, two casinos reopened after being shut for almost three weeks because of the flooding, said Caesars Entertainment, the company that owns and operates them. But farther south, Vicksburg residents face a long and slow goodbye to the historic flood that submerged much of their city, forecasters said. They predicted that the river could remain out of its banks until at least mid-June. The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist. It crested at 57.1 feet Thursday, and the weather service predicts the crest will hold through at least Saturday morning in Vicksburg. Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible, with heavier storms on Sunday. The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, he said. Some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 Vicksburg residents -- with relief. Others celebrated. Eddie Monsour, who owns a waterfront restaurant, threw a "River Crest Party" on Thursday night. It was a big success, he said. "Usually we've got a good crowd, but nothing like it is now. We're probably 200 people more than we usually are," Monsour told CNN affiliate WJTV. "There's tourists here. People from all over the state just coming to see the water. They've never seen anything like it." The patrons also included area evacuees such as Louise Roland of Eagle Lake. "(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said. "Hopefully, it'll start going down soon." All but about a dozen of Eagle Lake's 600 residents evacuated, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. "We talked about it and thought about it, but this really wasn't a decision at all," one of the holdouts, Cindy Roberson, told WLBT. "This is home. This is where our stuff is."	1
You've seen it a hundred times, in any thriller that finds the hero perched on a ledge or on the edge of a building's rooftop. The camera moves up and tilts downward, in a smooth unbroken shot, so that we can all know that the actor is really standing there. By now we're more than ready for that shot (it's become fairly ho-hum). But there's no way that I was ready for the extraordinary, dread-inducing Look Ma, no safety net! sequence in "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" where Tom Cruise makes his way across the surface of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- the world's tallest skyscraper -- while clinging to the building's glass panels with a pair of electrified adhesive gloves. Cruise, as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, is trying to break into the suite that houses the skyscraper's -computer servers, and this is the only way he can do it without being detected from within. Brad Bird, the director of Ghost Protocol, knows all too well that the audience will be on the lookout for any tell-tale cut, any obvious digital image, anything at all that reveals that Tom Cruise isn't really on the side of that skyscraper. And damned if we can find one! This is a sequence so ingeniously conceived and shot that even the audience doesn't want to look down -- a sequence so death-defying that it gets you laughing at your own susceptibility (especially if, like me, you happen to have a fear of heights). Shimmying up and down and around the building's surface, with the ground looking as if it must be a mile below, Cruise becomes a fearless human bug (think Spider-Man without the superpowers). Then, just as we're sure that our hearts couldn't dig any deeper into our throats, one of his gloves begins to short out and lose adhesive power. Don't you hate when that happens?

Gary Johnson says there are three keys to his campaign being successful: he needs you to know who he is, he needs to be on the ballot in as many states as possible and he needs other libertarians to support him. And for the next two months, Johnson, the Libertarian party candidate for president and acknowledged underdog, will be zig-zagging across the country to make those admittedly unique goals a reality. That is the thrust of his argument: Once you get to know me, I swear you'll like me. Johnson has fashioned himself the "clear alternative" to Republican candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in November's presidential election. The most recent CNN/ORC International poll shows that 3% of likely voters and 4% of registered voters say they'd vote for Johnson. But the fact he is even included in a poll is enough to get Johnson excited. "It is one thing if it gets reported that I am at 4% nationally," said Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, "but I don't think I go down when people take a look at who I am and what I have done, I think it actually goes up." And in some ways, he has proof to back that up. Johnson first ran for governor of New Mexico -- a state with a majority of Democratic voters -- in 1994 as a Republican. He won in the Republican primary, defeating three other Republicans, and then defeated an incumbent Democratic governor by 10 points. After four years in office, Johnson ran again and won in 1998. Johnson's popularity remained consistently high through his time as governor, leading one paper to remark that he was "arguably the most popular governor of the decade." CNN Poll: Could Gary Johnson be spoiler? But he has his work cut out for him. The most notable third party presidential contenders are from the 1800s -- John Tyler, Andrew Johnson -- and even they were largely independents because their original parties disowned them. The last third-party presidential candidate to make a significant run at the White House was Ross Perot in 1992. He ultimately carried no states and earned 19,743,821 votes. In 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was labeled as a "spoiler" after getting nearly 100,000 votes in Florida. He was seen by some as siphoning votes away from Democratic candidate Al Gore, who ultimately lost to George W. Bush in the closest election in modern U.S. history.	1
It's only as I'm inviting my friend to lunch that I realize the prospect might not sound that appetizing. "There will be a murder," I say. "Someone will die." Surprisingly undeterred, he agrees to meet me at London's  Park Lane restaurant.It turns out to be a lovely setting, an interior designed by the famed British designer Paul Burkhart. As the two of us settle into a booth, the subject of murder surfaces, and we talk about it at some length. Soon we are discussing the merits of murder, and soon we are discussing what we consider the most difficult of murders, that which might be called "the killing of the art."This is a case involving a famous Dutch painter. His name was Piet Mondrian. In the nineteenth century he was the star of the Dutch art school, known as the Hague School. His paintings were masterpieces that had a wide variety of subjects: portraits, nudes, still lifes, landscapes, and allegorical scenes of religious and historical themes. One of his most famous paintings was a series entitled "The Garden of Earthly Delights." It represents a series of trees and flowers that change in color and in size as they reach toward and then retreat from the viewer. These "elements of a work of art" were studied and admired in the nineteenth century by such painters as Leonardo da Vinci, Georges de La Tour, and Paul Cézanne. At the same time, Mondrian's work captured the imagination of the general public, who saw him as having captured the essence of beauty as part of a universal concept of creativity.Like many artists of the time, Mondrian was driven, as he put it, "to do everything with the utmost force and simplicity, to paint what I could not express if I did not do it myself." In later years, this drove him to work with a single-minded purpose toward bringing people closer—to bring them closer to himself.Mondrian fell victim to a tragic set of circumstances that he would tell us about only in later life. Early in his career his home studio was bombed, and pieces of his masterpiece "The Garden of Earthly Delights" were destroyed. It would not be until two decades after his death, in 1951, that the painting would be rediscovered by a German scholar, who was determined to see what he could of the work. It was only then that the	0
Until recently, if you sat in church on Sunday mornings, pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage. What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's  first state to adopt gay marriage, a poll showed 50 to 60 percent of Massachusetts residents in favor of same-sex marriage. Now, a decade after the Supreme Court granted a constitutional rights victory to gay couples, that same poll has the state in favor of same-sex marriage by about 25 percent.I asked Dan Cantor, who was director of the polling firm Public Policy Polling from 1998 to 2005, about the shift over the years in this public's attitudes on gay marriage.How long was the shift?"I don't think it's a shift at all that can be called in any way a generational thing," Cantor said. "I can understand why it's generational now, and it's generational in part because of these new people who have come into the electorate." That is, younger people, or millennials, don't see things the same way as older, more conservative voters.Why were those numbers so different from those 20 years ago?The change in a polling firm's results doesn't always mean anything in terms of what a firm's survey really shows."Public Policy Polling in particular has been very steady over the years," Cantor said. "Even in the early 1990s, we were very consistent."Cantor explained that Public Policy Polling's results from that time were all based on what the firm asked in the first year. So if, for example, the polling firm asked what the public thought about gay marriage and people said they were undecided, the firm would move on to the next poll question, and the answer from that next poll question would be "more favorable.""But I think what you're getting is just from the consistency in our polling and the fact that people are not changing their minds on gay marriage," Cantor said.A big problem with Public Policy Polling's polling is the methodology, Cantor said: it's an unscientific way of getting the answer. If the people say they're undecided, a pollster shouldn't leave them there; instead, it's reasonable to conclude that they're still undecided. But the Public Policy Polling polling shows no movement at all during this time.If the polls were more scientific	0
Doctors at the Technical University of Munich have conducted the world's first double-arm transplant ileum. Their innovative procedure enables surgeons to bypass the need to perform a bowel transplant ileum. The idea of the procedure is to take two small, healthy, tubular segments of ileum from the donor, separate them from each other and re-join them just outside the recipient, enabling the recipient's bowel to develop its full length.About 10,000 patients undergo single-transvesical and single-transmural transplants every year in the US, with around 8,000 of these surgeries being performed each year in Europe. However, the main hurdle for those patients who would like to receive a transplant is that the intestine from a deceased donor, typically, is not suitable for the recipient due to its size and function. For example, ileum has a length of around 8 feet and a diameter of 2.5–3.0 cm, while the average donor's intestine is 4.7 cm long and 2.1 cm in diameter. The conventional surgery procedure in the US involves the transplantation of multiple small bowel segments (1 or 2) from healthy donors by a single surgeon. Even in the case of multiple transplants, the ileum segment chosen is often only suitable for the recipient because it is too large and often does not contain enough muscle to adequately serve the recipient's needs.Currently, the most common type of donor preparation is called the Ryle procedure. The donor's bowel is placed in a bag and lifted by a crane to the top of a specially built lift. The bowel is then placed in a rubber glove and transported to the operating room where it is removed from the bag, and dissected open along the length of the ileum. The intestine is then placed back into the bag and transported back to the donor and a new bag is inserted for the next operation.In contrast, the double-arm transplant, as performed at the Technical University of Munich, is carried out using a robotic surgical system, thus reducing the need for physical intervention by two surgeons. The study authors wrote about how their procedure is performed:One of the key problems in current bowel transplantation surgery is the shortage of donor organs. Therefore, as part of our ongoing research we have designed a novel double-arm transplant ileum, which enables the performance of transplant surgery for the first time. In this procedure, a donor	0
Joao Victor Marcari Oliva could become one of Brazil's brightest Olympic talents, if he can step out of the shadows of a legend: his mum. Oliva is the son of Hortencia Marcari, who led Brazil's women to the  Silver medal at the 1968 Olympics. The pair's parents were both Brazilians, and they chose the surname Oliva as an homage to their homeland.When he was eight years old he won the 100m freestyle at the 1962 World Cup in the same stadium where his mother won her medal. He even got to use the same discus thrown by his mother, which he used again at the 2004 Olympics. He also participated in the same Olympics as his father at the 400m freestyle.At 14 he was named to Brazil's national team, where he became the first athlete to break the 13-minute barrier in the 100m by winning gold at the 1965 Pan American Games. This was only a year after his mother broke the 100m barrier in the same stadium. His success in the 1964 Olympics as a freestyle swimmer helped with his selection, and he became the first man to win two gold medals at the Olympics.Over the next few years, he won silver in the 400m and bronze in the 1,500m at the 1967 and 1968 Olympics.But it was his greatest achievement at the 1968 Olympics. In the 100m he won his first gold medal against a field of seven nations, before claiming the silver medal in the 200m. He then stormed to an impressive 10th place in the final of the final in the 400m and 4th place in the final of the 1,500m. He also held the world record in the 4x100m freestyle relay.His father is probably the most successful of all Brazilian Olympians, although Oliva's mother is better known in her home country. Today the Oliva family are regarded as a symbol of Brazilian identity, and are often cited to the detriment of the Olympic legacy.But Oliva's great success in the Olympics is overshadowed by another family legacy: the legendary and untouchable figure of his mother. In 1968 her husband, Mario, and her two sons, Marcari and Victor, won the medals she herself would have given up almost half a century earlier to earn them. In the same year she also set a new world record time of 47.4 seconds in her 200m	0
Editor's note: (Global Mail) -- The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's  door, after being dispatched from my home in Brisbane. I was asked to join the Prime Minister and his senior advisers in a room at the back of this, his official residence in Canberra.The room was decked out with a grand piano. You could just make out that an eight-man 'hiring bureau' of the future was now present. The Prime Minister asked me to sit beside him and I began, tentatively, to explain what I thought would be an amusing, if not quite promising career ahead of me. I wanted to study politics, to learn from the greats, to be a junior reporter at a foreign newspaper, to travel and to meet interesting people in interesting places, and to enjoy a good laugh.The Prime Minister turned to me and said he would be happy to put me on his staff, if I was prepared to help with his election campaign. In his campaign I was to tell the Australian people that Bob Hawke had lost the Labor leadership because he was incapable of leading a country, because he did not know how to lead the nation, because he was not a "leader".For the Prime Minister and his advisors, I was to be 'the man'.The Prime Minister is a man who has been described as "a cross between a human pantomime pony and a demagogue in rubber-soled shoes".When the Prime Minister called, his voice was booming and he seemed to be on an immense amount of energy. He said he wanted to thank his staff and he wanted everyone to join me and my wife. He asked us to come into the Prime Minister's office to discuss the possibility of my leading his national campaign.I remember feeling, at that moment, a mixture of anger and embarrassment. You had not really wanted to be offered the job of Prime Minister's press secretary, but, in a way, you did.Then, as I looked at him, one thing became very clear to me: that, as a Prime Minister who, in our modern political system, is the most influential person in the land, the most powerful individual in our country, Bob Hawke was in grave danger of losing his job,	0
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told a French magazine that "there haven't been any tangible" signs that U.S.-led airstrikes in his country have weakened ISIS, despite assertions Wednesday by America's top diplomat that Â“we haven't been able to take the caliphateÂ”Â”"I believe that the Syrian people and the Syrian regime won't accept the United States to have a clear or definite idea of what's going on in Syria.Â”He added, "There haven't been any tangible signs in any way, shape or form that the airstrikes have any effect on the jihad in Syria."At his press conference in Tehran Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said:"We have been studying this for months, from the beginning of Ramadan, of course during that time they have been very actively launching attacks against the opposition. The question of the strikes and the impact that they have had is very important because that's why we have been studying this from the beginning to the end."He went on to say: "And the answer to my question is going to, I can't predict it, but what I can say is is that this regime is a regime of terror and that's why we had to step in and begin taking action. So I think the Syrian people and the Syrian regime want to know that the United States is going to keep its word. And we'll keep doing what we need to do to support the Syrian people."Kerry went on to say that the "United States has carried out no air strikes outside of Iraq. And so we would certainly continue to support other actions such as ours in other areas."Secretary of State John Kerry told the French newspaper Le Figaro on Tuesday that "there hasn't been any tangible signs" that U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria have weakened ISIS, despite assertions Wednesday by the United States’ top diplomat that “we haven’t been able to take the caliphate.”“That is not a goal, that is something we are trying to achieve and the people of the world are beginning to understand,” Kerry said before a news conference in Tehran. “There are some people in the U.S. government who have given the impression that this is a goal. And I think it is one of our goals.”Speaking after a closed-door briefing on the situation with	0
At least 510 people were killed in Caracas, Venezuela, in December, giving support to a recent report that called the city the murder capital of the world. A chalk message reads No More Murders as a student protests  killings in Caracas in this file photo. It's against that backdrop that the country's minister for Interior Relations and Justice announced efforts this week to combat crime in 2009. Minister Tareck El Aissami said Monday he will form 50 community police units in Caracas and take other measures so that "we can have in a short time a culture of peace, tranquility and calm for all the Venezuelan public." By all accounts, it will be a tall order. Foreign Policy magazine said in September that Caracas tops the list of five murder capitals of the world, with an official tally of 130 homicides per 100,000 residents. The city, which is Venezuela's capital, has about 4 million inhabitants. Foreign Policy is owned by The Washington Post Co. and published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The United States made the magazine's top five, too, with New Orleans, Louisiana coming in at No. 3. Its murder rate is estimated as 67 per 100,000 by its police department and 95 per 100,000 by the FBI. Still, the rate in Caracas comes in far ahead of the following four murderous capitals. "Caracas has become far more dangerous in recent years than any South American city, even beating out the once notorious Bogota, [Colombia]," Foreign Policy said. "What's worse, the city's official homicide statistics likely fall short of the mark because they omit prison-related murders as well as deaths that the state never gets around to properly 'categorizing.' "The numbers also don't count those who died while 'resisting arrest,' suggesting that Caracas' cops -- already known for their brutality against student protesters -- might be cooking the books," the magazine said. CNN affiliate Globovision TV reported this week that officials reported 510 killings in Caracas this month, capping a particularly brutal year. "It's shocking," said Jennifer McCoy, director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta. "It's the biggest concern of the population -- crime and security." Federico Welsch, a political science professor at La Universidad de Simon Bolivar in Caracas for 25 years, has seen that crime up close.	1
Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday. The information being presented to Detroit prosecutors includes allegations that the 12-year-old boy, Charlie Bothuell, made to county child welfare authorities. Sgt. Michael Woody had earlier said the evidence could be handed over as early as Wednesday. The agency opened an investigation of the family June 23 after FBI agents looking into the boy's disappearance interviewed his grandmother. That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services. There was blood on the pipe, and old scars on the boy's buttocks, the petition said. The timing of the injuries is unclear, police said. "We are close to getting ready to submit our package to prosecutors," police Sgt. Michael Woody told CNN, adding the evidence could be turned over Wednesday. The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office will decide whether criminal charges will be filed. Mark Magidson, an attorney for the boy's father and stepmother, did not immediately return calls Wednesday seeking comment. Charlie Bothuell IV told authorities his son ran away after being scolded for not exercising or doing his chores. The FBI interviewed the boy as part of the investigation. The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him. "He had marks all over his arms and chest," the grandmother is quoted as saying. The FBI declined comment beyond acknowledging that agents met with the child. Charles Bothuell IV, and stepmother, Monique, have two other children. Both were taken into protective custody, investigators said. The child's father is not allowed to have any contact with Charlie while the investigation continues. The boy was discovered June 25 in the basement of his father's home, behind a barricade after numerous searches of the home in the days following his disappearance on June 14. Police said the boy had snacks and a sports drink in the basement. He told police his stepmother allegedly told him to hide there and "not to come out, no matter what he hears," according to court petition.	1

Misty and Larry Shaffer have been together since high school. She went to his senior prom; he went to her junior and senior proms. They got married in October 2008. He never said anything about her being overweight. When Larry, an Army specialist, was deployed to Afghanistan for a year in 2012, Misty decided she wanted to get in shape. She weighed about 260 pounds when he left, and less than 155 pounds when he returned. "I just sat in bed one night and was like, 'I can do this,'" she said. "'I need to do this.'" Shaffer, now 25 and living in Leland, North Carolina, has struggled with her weight her whole life, even as a child. Each time she had tried dieting in the past, she would relapse. Before she became pregnant with her daughter, Nevaeh, she took diet pills and lost 60 pounds. But all that -- and more -- came back after she stopped taking the pills. At her heaviest, she weighed around 300 pounds. She's 5 feet 6 inches tall. "I would eat when I was bored. I'd eat three huge meals a day, and then snack in between. Sad or happy, I'd turn to food for everything." Shaffer felt tired all the time. People picked on her. She wanted to surprise her husband, and work toward a better life for herself and her family. Her primary mission: Cut out all the junk. She stopped drinking soda, and tried to limit her liquids to water and coffee. upwave: Try it now! No fast food for a week The first three to four months were the hardest, she said. Once she got past that, she started craving more healthy foods and water. It got to the point where, if she drank a diet soda, it made her so thirsty that she didn't even want it. Shaffer's job presented its own challenges; she's a personal shopper at a supermarket. At lunch time, the hot fried chicken "just smells so good," she said. But the supermarket also offers a large, well-kept salad bar, as well as warm vegetables on the hot bar and oven-baked chicken. A typical breakfast for Shaffer is oatmeal with fruit or a cereal bar. On her days off, she'll cook up sausage, eggs or pancakes, but she'll watch her portion size. Around 10 a.m. she has a snack, such as fruit or carrots.	1
Those Jack Bauer fans just won't give up: The infamous character from Fox's long-running drama "24" was a big trending  subject on Twitter on Sunday.To recap, just two months ago, Bauer -- who's played by Kiefer Sutherland on "24" -- was kidnapped by terrorists in Pakistan. He escaped and landed in Los Angeles, where he went into hiding.He was rescued by an ex-CIA colleague (Maggie Lawson) who was then tasked with bringing him to justice.A little over a week after rescue, law enforcement officials arrested a Pakistani accomplice in connection to the kidnapping.And in a twist of luck that's all but guaranteed to make your head spin, the two men's lawyers had secretly agreed to go to the media with their clients' confessions, which turned out to be false.Bauer was released from prison on June 26, 2012, and was reunited with Law-son. The two hit it off, and Bauer quickly became a popular figure on "24."A year later, Bauer again went on the run -- this time to Afghanistan. He got involved with a terrorist group and was kidnapped, tortured and killed during a daring mission to get to the bottom of a plot involving a nuclear payload.The man who played Bauer was a big fan of the show, and, to tell you the truth, a little addicted to it."I'm so glad that Bauer's back, even if at the second time. It's definitely a relief to have him back," Sutherland told "Extra" in October 2015. "I mean, he's a great character. He's tough and he's not afraid to be himself. He's just a very likeable guy. He's one of those 'go to guys,' and we didn't really know where he would land at. But, you know, he's here."So, in honor of Kiefer Sutherland's love for "24," here are the top 11 tweets -- in order -- that celebrate Jack Bauer's return in 2012.1. "Jack Bauer Back In Town! — Jack Bauer Is Back In Top Gear? I Can't Wait!""Jack Bauer back in town! … I can't wait to watch my favorite TV show Jack Bauer back in action!" tweeted user @DudeBoyNYC.2.

Microsoft is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its Windows operating system -- and, by extension, how almost all devices running it work. Nearing the end of a long process of tinkering under the hood, the computing giant on Friday rolled out its final preview of Windows 8, which is expected to go on sale this fall. "Since our first preview release last September, millions of people now use the pre-release product on a daily basis and millions more have been taking it through its paces, totaling hundreds of millions of hours of testing," Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky wrote Friday on the Windows 8 blog. "We genuinely appreciate the effort that so many have put into pre-release testing, and of course, we appreciate the feedback too. Direct feedback and feedback through usage contributed to hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes." The post said Microsoft has received about 18,000 comments from 7,000 early testers of Windows 8, which have contributed to "hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes." The release will mark the first major update of Microsoft's operating system since Windows 7 was released three years ago. Unlike previous releases that have, essentially, revamped (or, in at least one case, mercifully killed) existing features, Microsoft is touting Windows 8 as a radical reimagining of its core product. Perhaps its most visible difference from previous versions of Windows will be its compatibility with touchscreen technology. That, combined with the system's ability to connect devices (say, a PC, a tablet and a Xbox gaming console) is what Microsoft hopes will renew the enduring Mac vs. PC war on a new front. "In our hands-on of Microsoft's Consumer Preview, we declared that your familiar Windows desktop is all but dead," Alexandra Chang wrote Friday for Wired. "In the changes we've seen in the Release Preview, this still holds true," she added. "Microsoft is focused on improving and deepening the Metro [the system's design language] experience, where the desktop is only a portion -- or even an afterthought, for some users -- of a larger, app-based system."	1

Abbott spoke to about 50 Australian soldiers and their Afghan counterparts. (AP Photo/The Independent, Simon Dawson)Australians have played a key role in the U.S. war on terror. Australian soldiers played a significant role over the past decade in the U.S. military campaign against al Qaeda in Iraq, as well as being directly involved in Afghanistan and now Pakistan, both of which are part of al Qaeda's network.The Australian military has been integral to the U.S. war against al Qaeda in Afghanistan.A video obtained by ABC News and aired on Friday, May 3, shows Australian special forces training Pakistani forces in how to conduct the "zero hour" raids, a complex form of snatch-and-grab raids where Pakistanis "blindly, blindly" follow American orders.The Australian Defense Force also played a key role in the 2010 war in Libya, deploying troops to the Libyan city of Misrata during the Libyan Civil War. U.S. forces led the war to remove Qaddafi from power.U.S. military officials said the Afghan war on terror has been difficult for many U.S. forces, including the Australian forces, because of the lack of resources, equipment, and skilled staff.The new U.S. president was in Australia Saturday, meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Abbott said he will have a full discussion with President Obama about how the United States will support the new Afghan government.President Obama has not yet announced when he will make a decision on whether to intervene in Afghanistan. The decision will be made "well in advance" of the NATO summit in London next week, a senior administration official said Friday, April 28, with the president making the decisions himself after consulting with military leaders.In a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll, 54% of Australians said they would support the U.S. military entering Afghanistan as soon as possible	0
A former security guard told CNN on Monday that he was unjustly fired after he took pictures of President Barack Obama's motorcade during a visit to Atlanta in September. Kenneth Tate worked for a private security firm when   he was hired on a permanent basis in 2010 to protect the Obamas.CNN says he was fired because of the "irregularities" he described and that he went to internal investigators with a list of grievances. But Tate says two federal agencies that were involved in the case took no action until this month, when the man's lawyer received an email from a government agency saying he had been fired for what "constituted unlawful conduct related to the job."The security guard says the agency's response indicates it made a determination in his favor, but that he still believes he should be paid for his work and was owed an apology from the Secret Service for the incident in Atlanta, where he said he and the Obamas were forced to wait for their car on the street for an hour on a rainy evening.A lawyer representing the government agency that terminated Tate says he made a mistake. He says Tate is owed an apology and he had a chance to go to the agency but refused."Mr. Tate has received a letter of apology from the city of Atlanta for the inconvenience experienced by Mr. Obama," says Stephen Tillery, the assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's civil rights division. "And at this time, Mr. Tate has not been paid his full compensation for the hours that he was not paid. And we continue to pursue repayment of that compensation as part of our ongoing efforts to resolve this matter."Tillery didn't appear to be talking about the apology as a solution or an admission of guilt. Instead, his statement about the apology says:"The City of Atlanta is seeking to avoid the perception that this was somehow an isolated incident, as was suggested by a statement made by Mr. Tate's immediate supervisor. To that end, the City and Mr. Tate have agreed that a public apology would be appropriate and, should he choose to accept the apology, he will be reimbursed by the City for expenses incurred by him as a result of the delay caused by him in moving the car after the President had departed."Tillery says, "I look forward to seeing Mr. Tate respond to the City's offer."CNN found out that Tate was paid the full $40	0
Fifty-two years ago, the survivors of the Springhill Mine Disaster in Nova Scotia revealed a few things to the world about the brutality of survival in the depths. Without food or water, cut off in every way from life on the surface, in a  world where even the dead might rise up and try to kill you, people of the Halifax Explosion are said to have learned to "think like a survivor."In this week's Time Magazine, we'll look in depth at that article's legacy with interviews with many of the people who participated in the original project.On Dec. 5, 1970, the day before Thanksgiving, the world learned that four of the five men who were rescued from the coal mine were dead. The fifth, William Brown, died in hospital on May 11, 1971.The article was titled "Survivors Tell of Horror in Nova Scotia: 'Hells, Yes, There Were Survivors' " and focused primarily on Brown, who had been working with a partner, James Mitchell, when the explosion occurred.The story begins with the rescue and the four men who were dead, and then focuses on Brown, who is buried in the nearby churchyard.Brown and Mitchell were the last to be rescued and the last to be given food. The story then switches to how the men were cared for in hospital. They were in pain, and the doctors had trouble caring for the men.The men were then taken to hospital in St. John's, a city of 60,000 residents. Their stay was described as one that made some of the most harrowing stories in this country's history seem like a picnic.This is the story of the men, their hospital stays, and how the two men who helped them survived.***On that day, the men were in danger of becoming the only survivors of the mine explosion. There were three ventilation shafts near the top of the mine. Both the ventilation shafts were large enough that they were easy to get to.The first men into the shafts found them wide open, with the lights on and the ventilation system running. They quickly descended the 60 or so steps to the coal face. The men had torches, water and torches with water.The second group of men found the coal face empty. The third group found the ventilation shafts opened and the air was filling with coal dust.An	0
There weren't any starlets or red carpet, but the Library of Congress had a blockbuster day at the movies on Thursday. The government of Russia presented the Library of Congress with digitally preserved copies of 10 silent films that previously had been thought to be lost forever. According to the Library of Congress, more than 80 percent of American movies from 1893-1930 -- also known as the "silent era" -- no longer exist in the United States. Like today's movies that are distributed to theaters around the world, many of those early silent films were circulated internationally. Over the past 20 years, the Library of Congress has discovered some of the missing films in international libraries and archives, like the Gosfilmofond, the Russian state film archive. "A study published by the Library of Congress in 1993 concluded that the majority of U.S. movies from the 1920s survive only in foreign film archives," said Librarian of Congress James Billington. He went on to explain that in the days of early American movie-making, many studios and theaters simply threw old movies away. Russia, he explained didn't generally throw them away. Many of the films sat in storage, making it possible for them to be preserved for restoration today. Caroline Frick, curator of motion pictures at the George Eastman House museum of photography and film in Rochester, New York, said such film repatriation projects are exciting, with "a huge array of film history that still remains unknown because so many of the films don't exist." Frick explained that Russia's digital preservation of American silent films is an example of how film preservation itself has changed, especially in the last 10 years. "It used to be that you preserved on film but now we have a multitude of ways, including making digital copies so that the images are preserved." Included in the restored movies is a 1923 film staring then-child-star Jackie Coogan, called "Circus Days," about a boy who runs away from his uncle to join the circus; and "Canyon of the Fools," starring Western movie star Harry Carey. Billington accepted the digitally preserved movies on hard drives presented by Vladimir Kozhin, head of Russia's Presidential Management and Administration Department, at a ceremony Thursday. These ten films are the first of hundreds that will be repatriated over time. The ten films presented Thursday, their studios and production year include: -- "Valley of the Giants" (Famous Players, 1919)	1
Sepp Blatter has told CNN that his main aim in his fourth and final term as FIFA president is to restore the battered credibility of world football's governing body. The 75-year-old was re-elected unopposed as head of the organization on June 1 after the only other candidate, Asian Federation chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, pulled out of the race before being provisionally suspended by FIFA over bribery allegations. The vote drew widespread criticism as Blatter received 186 votes from football's 208 member associations, with critics saying it should not have gone ahead until the investigation into Hammam and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner -- who was also subject to suspension -- had been completed. "I have said 'zero tolerance' is one thing, but I have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it's to rebuild the image of FIFA, that's number one, and I have already started," Blatter told CNN in his first sit-down interview since the election. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame "We are now somewhere where football needs a little bit more credibility because we came building up football, bringing so much money in to this game. "Automatically a lot of devils came in to the game and now we are in a situation where we have to go forward and we have to cut all these allegations, criticism, whatever. We can't do it in one day, but we will do it." Blatter -- who described his election win as "the title without glory" and called the ruling body "my FIFA" -- ruled out blanket life bans for any FIFA member found guilty of corruption. "It's not a killing instinct that we have to kill people! Zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field, you will have a punishment," the Swiss administrator said. "But it can be a yellow card, it can be a red card, it can be a suspension for two games, three games ... lifetime." Maradona attacks 'corrupt' FIFA chiefs Despite recent turmoil and opposition to Blatter in the race for the presidency, the Swiss insisted that both Hammam and Warner were longtime friends who remain on good terms. "We are friends, but friends going together when it is in the interest of some of the people. For me, going together with people it's only for the interest of FIFA because I have represented FIFA for 36 years -- it's my FIFA," Blatter said.	1
More than 90% of the Internet was shut down in Syria Thursday as rebel clashes with Bashar al-Assad's forces were reported near the Damascus airport. It's not the first time the Web has been blocked in the war-torn country, but the ills of Internet freedom are much deeper than that.This time, activists say, is different."A lot of people are trying to get in," said Hadiya Aitboulahla, cofounder of the Syrian Electronic Army, an activist organization that has taken Internet-based activism to the streets and onto the world wide web. "But every time they try, the government blocks their access."This time, says Ms. Aitboulahla, even the government won't allow the Internet to be a tool to organize the protests, which are now gathering momentum."I don't know what's going on behind the scenes. I really do not," said Ms. Aitboulahla. "The Internet has been very important to me in the past, but [this time] it's not working."If it's not working now, it will be when the revolution begins, she says. "It will be when the people stop being silent."The Internet shutdown in Syria, which began three weeks ago, is not a sign of Internet weakness or the fragility of the U.S. presence there. The U.S.-backed Syrian opposition says it has held off on using the Internet as a means of organizing and gaining public support in the past, in part because the Internet is not safe—because U.S. and British officials can track online information in real time, and the government has an "in-built monitoring unit" that can spot any attempt to circumvent the Internet's firewall.Moreover, "It was never the intention of the United States to control the Internet," said the official website of Syria's main opposition group, the Syrian National Council.What's actually happening in Syria is the work of the Syrian state, which is trying to isolate the rebels in an attempt to keep a lid on public protest and its attendant social fallout. The Syrian government says it's not using the Internet as a way to keep track of the protests, and that it's using it to organize and monitor the uprising. But the state's motives, along with the reasons for blocking access, are political, not technical.	0
South Africa's former national police chief, Jackie Selebi, was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison after he was found guilty of corruption charges last month. "You are an embarrassment to the police force ... you are an embarrassment to the country," Judge Meyer Joffe said after the sentence was handed down. "I am satisfied that a sentence of 15 years imprisonment is appropriate in the matter," the judge added, according to the South African Press Association. The charges stemmed from Selebi's relationship with convicted drug trafficker Glenn Agliotti -- a friendship that was no secret. Once asked about it at a news conference, Selebi famously said, "He's my friend. Finished and klaar" -- an Afrikaans term meaning "that's the end of it." After a four-and-a-half-year trial, the court found Selebi gave favors to Agliotti in exchange for money and expensive clothes. Joffe rejected Selebi's defense that there had been a conspiracy against him, although he acquitted the former police chief on a charge of defeating the ends of justice, according to SAPA. SAPA reported that Agliotti, who was appearing in a nearby courtroom on murder charges, had no comment on Selebi's sentencing. Selebi's attorney asked the judge to release his client on bail while he prepares an appeal in the case. South Africa's ruling African National Congress party said the verdict last month clearly indicated "that South Africa as a country is governed by laws that are applied without any fear or favor to anyone, regardless of their standing." Selebi was until recently one of the most powerful political figures in South Africa. He served as president of Interpol from 2004 to 2008 and was a close ally of former South African President Thabo Mbeki.	1
Police are investigating whether or what family issues  might have prompted a California man to shoot six of his family members -- killing five -- before committing suicide. His wife was critically wounded. Authorities on Tuesday said Devan Kalathat, 42, shot his family Sunday night at his Santa Clara townhouse, killing two adults and three children. Kalathat killed his 11-year-old son, Akhil Dev; his 4-year-old daughter, Negha Dev; his 35-year-old brother-in-law Ashok Appu Poothemkandi; Poothemkandi's 25-year-old wife, Suchitra Sivaraman; and the couple's 11-month-old daughter, Ahana. Kalathat's 34-year-old wife, who was not identified, sustained multiple gunshot wounds and remains in critical condition, said Lt. Phil Cooke. "Family dynamics and personal relationships may have played a factor," Cooke told reporters Tuesday. He said Kalathat was employed as an engineer and nothing indicated he was facing "layoff or financial crisis." Investigators believe Kalathat used two .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols, both of which he owned. Cooke said Kalathat bought one of the pistols in February and the other nearly two weeks ago -- roughly the same time his wife's brother, Poothemkandi, arrived in California from India with Suchitra Sivaraman and Ahana. Cooke noted that Poothemkandi was an "educated professional" with plans to stay in the Bay Area to work on a project for a high-tech firm. Police were called after a neighbor noticed Kalathat's wounded wife outside the home around 8:30 p.m. (11:30 p.m. ET), Cooke said. When police arrived, other victims were found around the kitchen and dining room in what Cooke described as "a very gruesome scene." The family shooting comes just two months after a Los Angeles father who, after he and his wife were fired from their jobs, killed her and their five young children before turning the gun on himself.	1
World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka rallied from a set and 4-0 down to unseeded Italian Alberta Brianti as she eventually emerged into the second round of the French Open on Monday. The 22-year-old looked ursine with a backhand for victory, but the match should've been called a tie after a lengthy rain delay.While her first-round opponent's nerves were undoubtedly a factor in her performance, Azarenka was more than justified for her win, which earned her a spot in the second round of the second Grand Slam of the year.Victoria Azarenka of RussiaVictoria Azarenka's first round win over Alberta Brianti of Italy could not have been much sweeter.Azarenka, the world No. 1 but most notable for her dominant run at the U.S. Open, looked to have clinched her spot on the WTA Tour with a dominating win over Brianti, who is attempting to qualify for her first WTA Tour Grand Slam event and the round of 16 in Paris.Azarenka took control from the start, making it easy to see what was going to happen: that Azarenka would make a run at the title and that she would win a title in Paris.Azarenka went on to win her opening set, 4-0, and then went on to win the next four games of each set, finishing things off with 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 win over Brianti.Brianti had a chance to tie the score up at 4-4 in the second set and it wasn't until she pushed Azarenka to break serve that the score was tied. Then, the match went to three hours and 17 minutes.After an hour and 17 minutes, the rain began to descend, and it looked as if Brianti's hopes of going further in the tournament would be over.But the rain held off until Brianti broke Azarenka and Azarenka served out the set, but Brianti got another break in the deciding set, and Azarenka came back to win 7-5, 6-1.Brianti fought bravely throughout a third set that saw two breaks of Azarenka's serve, but she could not get herself out of the set.Azarenka then took a chance on another break, but Brianti fought back	0

Their faces stare from old photos, their voices silent since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through Tacloban in the Philippines on Friday. At first Daisy Nemeth wasn't worried. Her family was close, they kept in touch.  But in the hours after the typhoon's onslaught, she grew worried, calling friends to check up on them."I checked on them, I called them in a panic," said Nemeth.Nemeth is a psychotherapist. She helped a dozen families rebuild their lives after the super typhoon slammed into Tacloban, a city of around 250,000 across the southern tip of the Philippine island of Leyte. She has seen what happens to people who feel alone after a disaster.  "There is something almost inhuman about it — you just feel so alone," Nemeth said. "You look at a face and that's all you have. You don't have your family, or your friends. My life was my work. I needed to be there with these families."Here are profiles of some of the people who survived typhoon Haiyan, the Philippines' strongest storm on record, from our own reporters.A boy who lived through super typhoon HaiyanIt's been six days since giant typhoon Haiyan made landfall on Leyte, killing more than 6,000 people in the Philippines. Daisy Nemeth, psychotherapist, has been working with people who survived.She works at the San Agustin Clinic, a mental health center in Tacloban, which is near where the storm hit, on January 10, 2013.Nemeth said she was looking forward to seeing her patients again: "They're the people that have been affected by the storm and come here for some time. We will do our best to build the trust between the two groups, and to make sure they come to each other in a safe environment, where they will be safe."Nemeth's colleagues at the center have prepared for the storm's visit. A generator will be set up so women can watch cartoons, play games and even relax under the sun. The clinic has been able to set up a food bank "so that people are fed to the extent that they could."Nemeth is working with families who have lost home and all they have known.

A U.S. destroyer is shadowing a ship off the coast of Somalia after it was taken over by 50 pirates, authorities said. The M/V Iceberg was identified last week after the USS McFaul conducted a 36-hour surveillance mission, the multi-national Combined Maritime Forces said in a statement. The USS McFaul began shadowing the Panamanian-flagged vessel May 19 before the M/V Iceberg reversed course and began heading toward the Somali coast. "We cannot be sure what the pirates' plan was if they had not been interrupted," said Rear Adm. Beom Rim Lee, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces task force. "The vessel may have been on its way to either assist other pirates in distress, or look for another merchant vessel to attack," he said. The M/V Iceberg was last been seen off the coast of the Somali town of Garacaad, a known pirate haven, but its exact location was unknown until USS McFaul positively identified it. "Further investigation showed the name of the ship had been crudely painted over" in an effort to disguise it, which caused confusion in identifying it, the Combined Maritime Forces statement said. The USS McFaul had initially requested to board the ship to check on the crew. The M/V Iceberg denied it had been taken over, saying it was having mechanical difficulties. Eventually, crew members radioed back saying they had been taken hostage by heavily armed pirates, officials said. The M/V Iceberg has a crew of 24 from Yemen, India, Ghana, Sudan, Pakistan and the Philippines, officials said. Cmdr. Ronald W. Toland, Jr., commanding officer of USS McFaul, said he tried to ensure the safety of the crew first. "Given the report of heavily armed pirates on board, it was more prudent to monitor the ship's movement, rather than attempt a rescue," he said.	1
A Utah judge has ordered a registered sex offender who faces nearly two dozen charges of child sex abuse released on the basis that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial. At a hearing on Thursday, Fourth District Judge James Taylor, who previously ruled Lonnie Johnson incompetent to be tried on sex crime charges, said there were no legal grounds for holding him. "We are at the end of the road...I can't do anything but have him released from the state hospital," Taylor said at Thursday's hearing. Taylor said he was following a Utah statute requiring the release of anyone deemed incompetent to stand trial and who has not been convicted of a crime. Johnson, 38, has been diagnosed with a cognitive disorder. Doctors who examined Johnson found his competency could not be restored. They also said he is not a danger to society and did not qualify for involuntary institutional commitment. Johnson faces five counts of rape of a child, six counts of sodomy on a child and 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, according to court documents. In 2006, he was convicted of raping a teenage girl in Washington State, sent to prison for third degree rape and served less than a year, according to court documents. He is required to register as a sex offender wherever he lives. "I am outraged that a convicted child sex offender, currently facing another round of accusations, could be released without being tried for current charges," Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert said. "It's outrageous for both the victims and the accused that Mr. Johnson won't get his day in court," he said. In November, a status hearing will be held under the judge's orders and he will appoint two new doctors to evaluate Johnson. Prosecutors have also filed a new motion asking the judge to reopen competency hearings in the criminal case. "What I wanted to do was jump over and take care of it myself,'' said Christy Danner, whose daughter is an alleged victim of Johnson. ''But that's not what we can do and that's not the way our system works, and we're going to have to fix this system and then hopefully get him back in the state of Utah and find him competent,'' Danner said on HLN's "Nancy Grace." Danner cited Johnson's previous ability to hold down jobs and earn a living, and said she thinks Johnson is faking incompetence.	1
A well-placed pool of water and an air pocket appear to have combined to help a young woman survive for 16 days under the rubble of a collapsed Bangladeshi building. The woman, who was pulled out Friday from the remains of the garment factory, was found in that pool of water, rescue official Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain told CNN. It would have been crucial to her survival, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The woman, known only as Reshma, 19, was able to use an iron rod to get workers' attention and cry out to them, "I'm alive. Please rescue me," according to Capt. Ibrahim Islam, a Bangladeshi military official outside the recovery operation. The rescue was a bright spot against the grim recovery. The death toll from the April 24 collapse is more than 1,000. The woman reportedly was in a partially collapsed room and had access to an air pocket, which Gupta said is "obviously, the most crucial thing." In addition, "having some access to water must have happened here," he noted. The source of the pool of water was unclear. Water may have trickled to the building's basement, where Reshma was found, from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers. Firefighters had hosed down the area to extinguish a fire that erupted during a failed rescue attempt. Gupta said the woman likely had some sort of access to food, although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it. He said it was "somewhat surprising" that Reshma would have been able to call out to rescuers, as "even that requires a fair amount of energy." Asked how long someone can survive without food or water, Gupta said, "We keep redefining that a bit." He recalled the case of Evan Muncie, a then-28-year-old man who was pulled alive from a building in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, about four weeks after a January 2010 earthquake that leveled much of the city. It is believed Muncie had some access to food and water, although details remain murky, he said. Also, Reshma's youth may have worked in her favor, he said. "The body can be very good at preserving itself." A body can enter a state known as starvation ketosis, Gupta said, in which it utilizes muscles and other sorts of protein to feed itself.	1
A Russian company is seeking to buy a controlling interest in one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the United States -- a sale that requires U.S. government review because of possible national security concerns. For the second time in less than a year, Russia is trying to acquire the assets of U.S. uranium miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc., which would put the world's third largest producer in the Russian hands.Russia's Rosatom is trying to buy the Texas-based extraction operation at the center of an espionage scandal. The deal would give Rosatom control of a large uranium mine, processing center and reprocessing plant that produce 20 percent of U.S. uranium output. It would also make Freeport-McMoRan one of only four U.S. companies that have facilities for extracting uranium that can be used as nuclear fuel, rather than used to make nuclear explosives.Freeport-McMoRan spokeswoman Marybeth Salines said the company welcomes the Russian offer.Salines said Rosatom's bid was "very competitive" and "reflects the current operating environment with respect to the price for uranium." The sale price of $14 billion, she said, "would allow us to have a competitive and innovative business while also meeting the needs of our shareholders and the government for a return on investment."Russia's government is trying to sell Rosatom its entire stake in Freeport to create a monopoly in the North American uranium market and ensure Rosatom's economic survival. But the deal has been opposed by critics of Russia's energy sector, who say it would take Russia's oil and natural gas exports to the U.S. and elsewhere away from the U.S., threatening key U.S. industry sectors and national security.The Russians say it is necessary to make a deal to ensure Freeport-McMoRan's success and profitability. "We have an enormous resource, and we'll use it as we deem appropriate," said Yury Borisov, head of Rosatom, at a news conference in Moscow. "As soon as Freeport-McMoRan goes from making nuclear raw materials to making weapons, there will be serious damage to our interests and our security."Analysts say the deal is likely to fail because of concerns about Russian anti-proliferation efforts and U.S. security concerns. They argue that the Russian offer	0
In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House. After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under  a fresh storm of criticism from the progressive left for the delay in implementing two of its signature domestic policy initiatives: the DREAMer program and the ObamaCare exchanges.But Obama could not be blamed for any of this. He is the only politician who could have navigated the treacherous political waters and come out even in his re-election campaign. In a country dominated by demagoguery, with the Republicans, who make up half its population, promising cuts to government programs to pay for tax cuts, he was essentially the only sensible voice — save for his own — on the national stage.“I think he’s a remarkable person,” House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters after the vote, when he said Obama had failed to act on immigration and the Obamacare exchanges. “He’s been an extremely successful president, and I just think that a lot of folks didn’t appreciate how good president he is.”Now Obama is being hounded on Twitter by people who are not pleased with how the administration is handling the DREAMers issue. He has been criticized for his inaction on the Dreamers and, for that matter, the entire Affordable Care Act. The problem, as the liberal blog ThinkProgress pointed out, is that this was always a problem.First, as noted, these are the children of illegal immigrants. They are in the same position as any other immigrant immigrant. If they are brought here illegally, they are eligible for legal status, whether or not they applied for one. As the New York Times recently pointed out, there is no reason to treat them as criminals. “There’s nothing to be gained by treating them as criminals, since they would be punished as criminals anyway,” said the Times.Second, the DREAMers are overwhelmingly in favor of immigrants. They want the immigrants who came here illegally to be treated like everyone else. They want a path to legal status that would not require them to return to their home country, including the payment of a fee. That’s what the Dream Act did.Third, these children are citizens of the United States. Most of them are U.S	0
Italian football manager Carlo Ancelotti has gone from Milan to London in less than a day. Carlo Ancelotti will take over as manager of Chelsea from July 1 this year. Just 24 hours after resigning from his ????[1], Carlo Ancelotti has been confirmed as the new Chelsea manager. The move will allow Ancelotti to take charge of his old club, and to help in the hunt for a long-term future at Stamford Bridge. The former Italy manager has been out of office at Milan since the 2007/08 Serie A season after the team was relegated to Serie B. However the move to Chelsea will be his first spell in English football as a manager for a club lower than the Premier League.The announcement was made on Monday (16 January) by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck in a statement on the club's official website. He was confirmed after the club's official board meeting on Tuesday 16 January.Ancelotti has not yet started to work for the club, as the club needs to give all formalities before he begins his new job. Ancelotti will also be required to go through the process of signing contracts with the media, and his contract will also have to be ratified by the FA.Ancelotti's announcement has caused a lot of speculation about the best replacement for Andre Villas-Boas, who was sacked on Monday (16 January) after just three months in the job. The appointment of Ancelotti will see Chelsea move up a level in the league table, with their current position of 16th in the Premier League.The former Italian player has been a popular choice for Chelsea fans on and off the field. However the prospect of facing a difficult journey to the Premier League for such a big name, has also caused the public to be confused.The Italian coach has previously worked on an interim basis with two other clubs, in Inter Milan and Chelsea. In Italy, an interim manager is appointed with the intention of being a permanent replacement for the regular manager. However, the decision is ultimately made by the board. This can then lead to a change of management, as the previous interim manager decides to step down, the board decide to continue with the new appointment, and the manager himself decide to depart, with the intention to move to a club from the lower or lower-middle classes.Ancelotti's decision to move to Premier League football may be the first ever managerial	0
It is about to get a bit more difficult to illegally download TV shows, movies or music online. A new alert system, rolling out over the next two months, will repeatedly warn and possibly punish people violating digital copyrights. The Copyright Alert System was  introduced in 2011, and had no immediate impact on piracy. Now, though, it may be about to get a bit more difficult.An alert system called Rightshoppers was introduced in 2011 to "make piracy more difficult". It was intended to use various Internet tools to locate people illegally downloading, and was meant to encourage other businesses to take action.But the system turned out to be very ineffective. Most people who turned up on Rightshoppers were never found, because doing so would take time, and Rightshoppers had no means of gathering evidence against users. At first, the FBI and US Department of Commerce didn’t believe that Rightshoppers was effectiveBut the system was not perfect. It was also ineffective - most people who turned up on the system were never found, because doing so would take time. In 2011, a US judge ordered that Rightshoppers be shut down, finding that the website did "not provide a meaningful solution" to copyright infringement.In an email to TorrentFreak, TorrentFreak Editor-In-Chief Tim Kuure said:"Rightshoppers was not designed to deal with illegal downloads and piracy. It was a warning to users of the Internet who were found downloading pirated material. It worked to get people off the Internet and off the suspect lists and into the hands of the FBI, and also into the hands of the copyright owners. But in the end, it was a waste of money and resources, and it made it worse for rights holders by putting rights holders onto the suspect list.""What Rightshoppers offered was not only ineffective, it was actually a liability to the sites and individuals who were involved. It led almost completely to the deletion of the infringing material on the computers that were being checked... In any other criminal investigation, the police would be looking for ways to get to the evidence, and rightshoppers was a waste of resources. Not only was it not effective, it was a liability."However, as more and more people turned up on Rightshoppers looking for help on pirating movies, music and TV shows, it started becoming more effective. The system was getting its first major	0
It's been a long time since the Bay Area's cuisine was defined by sourdough and Rice-A-Roni. Ever since Alice Waters' renowned restaurant Chez Panisse opened in Berkeley and ushered in the local food revolution, the region has become home to a growing tribe of foodies, locavores, chef groupies and ecstatic eaters that I call "foodhemians." They don't just just worship food here, they raise grass-fed golden calves, humanely slaughter them and serve them with a side of precious. There are a million reasons why food is big in the Bay. Here are three: 1. The high concentration of wealthy, health-conscious people. 2. A long tradition of epicureanism rooted in San Francisco's identity as a port town. But the big one is 3. Location. Northern California is a land of abundance from its wide variety of fruits and vegetables, courtesy of the Mediterranean climate, to its dungeness crabs crawling on the ocean floor. Now imagine if the foodhemians discovered that all of those foodstuffs were free. That all they need to do is know where to look. They have. Foraging is all the rage in the Bay these days. Part of foraging's appeal is its elegance: Find wild things that you can eat, collect them and put them in your stomach. But things like private property, naturally occurring poisons and pollutants complicate what in theory is a simple project. So a paradox was born: organizations that help you get wild. Found Fruit and Forage Oakland are two groups that offer foraging-related events. What's wrong with Stockholm The 60-year-old Mycological Society of San Francisco (read: "mushroom people") meets monthly and organizes occasional walks, but the most comprehensive foraging group in the Bay is ForageSF. Of course, you can also just buy a plant identification book and take a walk. I decided to spend $40 and go on a sea forage with Kirk Lombard, fisherman and raconteur. His sea foraging tour, offered through ForageSF, was recently named "Best Walking Tour" in San Francisco. (He also offers variations on the foraging tour that you can learn about at his website.)	1
Last year we published a list of quintessential Americana experiences. You can find it here. They weren't necessarily the most patriotic, obvious or agreeable choices. NASCAR, bourbon, state fairs, Vegas, what's not to love? Apparently, _________ . I was pretty disappointed with the list's tone, and I wanted to apologize in advance. This year, I wanted to go back to the beginning, to give Americana what it needs most: a bit of a voice, a new angle, a fresh look.Last year I looked at three regions within the American West: the Great Plains, the High Plains and the Rocky Mountain West. I thought of it as a regional tour and tried to include at least some of the best—or even most—Americana that each region offered. I thought, why not start with the region that I have written about far more than any other: the Great Plains.To make it feel like it was my first time in this landscape, I decided to set the tone with a couple of fictional characters and a movie.The first character I introduced was a cowboy. In many of the stories I've written for the past two decades, I've had cowboys in the saddle (or driving a horse). I have one in my new book, Blue Mesa Ranch, as well as some other stories in the pipeline, but nothing I can talk about until I finish it. For the book, I had my cowboys shoot down the Texas Rangers to keep them from shooting all the Mexicans.The second character I introduced was the local sheriff. I met a few, not many. The story I will talk about here is the story of how I met, in actual life, the county sheriff in Casper, Wyoming.Sitting in the office of the sheriff of White River County in Wyoming was one of my dearest friends in the writing world, the award-winning author of numerous books and screenplays: Bill Bryson. I spent a long day with Bill, just hanging out and talking about books, politics, books, books, about a thousand books and more. We talked about what we remembered about the most-read books of all time: the books, both great and terrible, we still have on our shelves.I also talked about the best-selling novels that were published during his lifetime: what they were about, why they resonated with him or with so many	0
A mission to evacuate Americans from South Sudan was aborted Saturday when an aircraft carrying U.S. military members was fired upon as it prepared to land in Bor, wounding four of them, the Pentagon said. The most ern...MOSCOW, November 23, 2008 (RFE/RL) -- Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB successor organization, on Tuesday denied that it had anything to do with the assassination of Andrei Sakharov, an icon and dissident in the Soviet era who died in October."That's nonsense, there's nothing to say, there's nothing to prove," Alexander Lukashevich, a senior FSB spokesman, told Lenta.ru, a Web site that posts news stories.Lukashevich's denial is the first since the day on October 27 when Andrei Sakharov was shot in a park in the western Russian town of Kirovograd in a suspected assassination that has led to a wave of protests, including by young opponents of President Vladimir Putin.Sakharov, a Nobel Prize winner in Literature, was an architect of what became known as the "Prisoners of Siberia" movement to free the country's political prisoners. The movement won international acclaim and led to Sakharov's rehabilitation in the Communist era.Since Russia embarked on a course of political liberalization and democratization in the 1990s, it has become one of the most modern democracies in the world. But there have been persistent allegations about the role of the security services and the Kremlin in the deaths of Sakharov and Yelena Mizulina, a dissident who was killed in December 2001.Andrei Sakharov, a Russian author and dissident, was gunned down in a park in the western Russian town of KirovogradThe Kremlin has repeatedly said that the two men were killed in a private encounter with unknown assailants who mistook them for a threat to state security. The Kremlin has never elaborated on what it believed the threats were.Andrei Sakharov was a leading spokesman in the "Velvet Revolution" and a strong opponent of the Soviet communist regime. He is credited with leading the way for dissidents to win amnesty for political prisoners.The day before Sakharov was shot, he was honored at a Moscow theater with a memorial plaque that praised his work against "the prison camps of	0
South Korea will stage its first Formula One grand prix in 2010, motorsport's governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA),  announced on Monday. Work is in progress at the 5.6km site of the  Hwasun circuit south of Seoul for a race that will be the inaugural F1 race to be held in the South Korean capital.FIA President Max Mosley said Seoul will be the first city to host Formula One during the 2010 season."The Formula One race in Seoul will be a great occasion for the city of Seoul, and for the Korean people, as it will be the first Formula One-based race in South Korea. It will also be a very important milestone in the development of a new sport in Korea,” Mosley said. "At this stage of the planning process, we are not in a position to reveal the exact location of the race. I can assure you that the race will take place next to one of the major roads of Seoul, which will make it possible to stage the race at a great location for the fans."Mosley will attend a press conference at the inaugural Hwasun circuit to present the event to the media, but the FIA president also confirmed that the race can be watched live at the official Hwasun website. FIA and Formula One management officials will attend the announcement press conference, but it was unclear if either side would be present on the scene."The opening of this prestigious race track, one of the main arteries of Seoul and its capital city, will be a major turning point in the sport in Korea," said FIA chief James Warby. "We are delighted to be working together on this new event, the first of its kind in the country, and we wish Max and his colleagues a safe and successful event.""I am very much looking forward to the ceremony and the start of the race,” said Kim Jong-su, the FIA's president for Asia. “It will be a great start to the Formula One season in South Korea. On behalf of Korean fans and drivers, I wish Max and the team all the best for a successful and safe race. I hope that the FIA's decision to stage an F1 race in Seoul will be a good and memorable one."At the FIA press conference, Mosley said the FIA and Formula One will work on creating a "road map" for the sport	0
So many hours of talks, so little progress. Despite two days of intensive negotiations, Iran and six world powers "remain far apart" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday in Kazakhstan. **************http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/pages/2012/08/07/Rouhani-Kushner-Ashton-Nuclear-Negotiations.htmlIran to extend nuclear program by a year, say foreign diplomats Iran said on Monday it would extend its nuclear program by one more year after the United States and six world powers said they would seek "unconditional" easing of the sanctions on the Islamic republic.The agreement, brokered by the six powers -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- sets a five-year deadline for curbing Iran's nuclear activity, but U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that Iran must stop enrichment of uranium that could be used as fuel for an atomic bomb.

Many years ago I performed at the Surf Ballroom, in Clear Lake, Iowa, which was the last stop on Buddy Holly's final tour. He was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson and Ritchie Valens. By this time, Buddy Holly and I had had a pretty long history together. The concert that I performed at had all the old members of his group. Donna, who Ritchie Valens wrote a song about, was also there.  Peggy Sue, who Buddy Holly sang about, was there too. The Picks were there -- they sang background vocals on Buddy's records -- as well as singer Tommy Allsup, who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site. Unfortunately some fans at this show were selling crash-site photos, which I thought was in extremely bad taste. I think the prospect of the National Transportation Safety Board delving into the crash again, which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest, would be in similarly bad taste. I think there's a reason we say, "rest in peace." Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments which, in retrospect, nobody -- and I mean nobody, not the Beatles the Rolling Stones or anyone else -- can beat, for these reasons: By the time he was 22 years old he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself and each of them, in my view and the view of many others, a hit. Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed. No rock 'n' roll records can touch songs like "Rave On," "Think it Over," "Not Fade Away," "Peggy Sue" and many, many more. He was also a sensitive, ballad composer and singer, which people often overlook, with songs like "Moondreams" and "True Love Ways," among many. As a paperboy, I cut open the stack of papers on February 3, 1959, and saw that Buddy Holly had been killed in the plane crash. The next day I went to school in shock, and guess what? Nobody cared. Rock 'n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57, nor had the others in the plane crash.	1
In a further sign that China is edging ahead as the world's dominant space power, Wang Yaping -- the second Chinese woman in space -- gave a physics lesson to school children from zero gravity. Speaking through a video link from the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft to a class of middle school students in Beijing, Wang demonstrated the effects of zero gravity on water and a pendulum. The blue-clad astronaut also showed how she could push a fellow astronaut into the wall of the module with touch of her finger and gulped down the drop of water as it floated in mid-air. Mass audience More than 60 million students across China watched the lecture on China's state broadcaster CCTV as Wang demonstrated Newton's second law of motion (force equals mass times acceleration) and the surface tension of water. Wang fielded questions from students that ranged from whether the team had seen any space junk or even UFOs, to the efficacy of weight scales in space. The demonstration drew a spirited response on social media in China, with comments on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- ranging from enthusiastic support for the country's space program, to questioning the cost of the Shenzhou-10 program. "The U.S. used to be proud of their space class, (but) now we've made it, too!" one user posted. "We should be proud of this. What others have, we have it too." Experimental space station China launched three astronauts into space on board the Shenzhou-10 craft last week to dock with Tiangong-1, an experimental space station used to test orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities. It is China's fifth manned mission to space in a decade. While the space station only has a two-year operational lifespan, the development of a permanent space station is part of Beijing's ambitious multi-billion dollar space plan, which is being hailed by the Communist Party as a symbol of China's growing technical expertise. China first sent a human into space in 2003 but is already planning to complete its space station by 2020, and sometime afterwards land a man on the moon. Despite the ambitious space program, China still lags Russia and the U.S. and is still attempting to reach milestones achieved by the two superpowers decades ago. Playing catch-up	1
A lot of people have been outraged by the gender verification testing that South African athlete Caster Semenya has been put through, and have been trying to be supportive of her; but in vernacular feminism, what she is doing is not only 'unjustifiable', but also 'fascistic'.The test shows that not just male bodies but all bodies, male and female, can produce androgenic hormones, and that this can be measured. This information is used by doctors to decide whether to provide prescription treatment, which can cause health problems and can even be life threatening.Caster Semenya, who won gold in the 1500m at the London Olympics, is to receive hormone therapy in her 20s as the result of a blood test showing that her body produces too much dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in addition to testosterone. This can lead to many serious health problems, and will cost thousands of pounds to the taxpayer.We are still not entirely sure how the test was done, but we are fairly certain that it was done in the lab and it was a computer-generated result – the result of millions of computer calculations.The test shows that not just male bodies but all bodies, male and female, can be affected by the androgens. Women can produce androgens too, and not all women are born to produce these. The test also shows a clear link between higher levels of androgens and a lower risk of breast cancer.The test also shows that not just male bodies, but all bodies, male and female, can produce androgens. This is obviously a very important issue, and the test is not just about one athlete but about millions of women and men.In the test as well one can find that men who had low levels of testosterone were at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer, which is one of the most common cancers. However, men who had high levels of testosterone (even if not of low hormone level) had a higher risk of prostate cancer.It is important that the test only be used in the context of a person's androgen level, and not in the context of her sex. It is not a test for gender identity, nor is it about sexual orientation, nor does it have anything to do with the way that a person feels about being a woman or a man.Women taking hormone medication, especially when they need the treatment for a	0

Martin Scorsese's "Hugo" has more nominations, and among the nine contenders for best picture, only "The Tree of Life" has made less money at the box office, but ever since the New York Film Critics Circle named a black and white French silent film the best picture of the year back in November, "The Artist" has been the unlikely frontrunner in the Academy Awards race. And there it has remained, picking up the lion's share of the top prizes across the awards season, from the various trade guilds and industry groups to the Golden Globes and the Baftas. There has been a similar conformity even in those categories -- like best actress -- which "The Artist" won't win. "The Help" star Viola Davis is the red-hot favorite in that race, which would extend Meryl Streep's losing streak to an unlucky 13 nominations since her 1983 win for "Sophie's Choice." All of which could make Sunday's ceremony the most predictable -- and anti-climactic -- Academy Awards in recent memory. And that's saying something! Here's the breakdown of the major categories, who we think will win, who should win, and our selections for the most undeserved omissions from the list, the nominees that Oscar overlooked this year. The Nominees SW = Should Win WW = Will Win Best Picture "The Artist" WW "The Descendants" "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close" "The Help" "Hugo" SW "Midnight in Paris" "Moneyball" "The Tree of Life" "War Horse" Overlooked: The industry didn't know what to make of "Margaret," Kenneth Lonergan's film was overshadowed by its long and troubled backstory -- so it chose to ignore it. But this ragged, emotionally gripping drama was an unsung American masterpiece, a more probing study of grief and youth than "Extremely Loud," "The Descendants" or even "The Tree of Life". Actress in a Leading Role Glenn Close ("Albert Nobbs") Viola Davis ("The Help") WW Rooney Mara ("The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") SW Meryl Street ("The Iron Lady") Michelle Williams ("My Week with Marilyn")	1
Efren Penaflorida was grateful when Typhoon Haiyan bypassed his home in Cavite City, Philippines. But when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country, he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow Filipinos. "I was crying watching the news," said Penaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year. "It really sank my heart, seeing all the people who lost their loved ones, houses. They lost everything." Penaflorida immediately began collecting donations at his mobile "pushcart classrooms," which he uses to educate poor children in the country. But he wanted to do more. So he reached halfway around the world to Doc Hendley, a North Carolina clean-water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009. After a disaster strikes, access to clean water is vital to help prevent the spread of disease. Hendley, who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur, Haiti and Syria, had just started assessing how his nonprofit, Wine to Water, might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida's e-mail. "I was already thinking that maybe I should go, " Hendley said. "When he shot me the e-mail ... he sealed the deal. "Our organization depends on relationships with people on the ground ... (and) what better relationship than with Efren?" Soon, Hendley was on a flight to the Philippines with hundreds of water filters in tow. Penaflorida picked him up at the airport in Manila. "That was a long trip from the U.S. to the Philippines ... and he has put out his own money and resources to help us," Penaflorida said. "We were both excited, seeing each other." The next day, both men helped volunteers assemble the filters and pack 120,000 meals donated by Stop Hunger Now, one of Hendley's partner organizations. Then they headed to Tacloban, in the heart of the devastated area, to deliver the filters. Hendley said it's hard to communicate the scope of the disaster. "It reminds me of Haiti because the buildings are completely collapsed, destroyed ... but it's different," he said. "The trees on mountains are blown over, lying down like matchsticks, and palm trees have snapped in half, broken. It's pretty shocking."	1
A spokesman for Somalia's Islamic party, a militant group in the horn of African nation, has confirmed that the group has merged  with a splinter faction from the terror group.The new organisation  known as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in northern France.An attack in Paris in which one person was killed when a lorry loaded with gas cylinders was driven into crowds celebrating Bastille Day has been linked to AQIM.President François Hollande says that the Paris attacker, which he described as a "born terrorist", was inspired by the group's teachings.As France marks its 'liberation from tyranny', AQIM has claimed responsibility for attacks in Mali and Niger.France and Britain have sent their military forces to fight in Mali in an attempt to regain control of the north of the country from groups linked to the AQIM.This comes after a bomb planted under the car of a French policeman killed himself and injured two soldiers and seven civilians in MaliAQIM claimed responsibility for these attacks this week, calling them "heroic".But the group's spokesman, Tariq Abdallah, later contradicted the group's claim in a statement on the group's Twitter account.He said that the group had never claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks."We are now working with a splinter group from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali and we have merged the two organisations," Abdallah said."We are targeting those who have attacked civilians, killed the innocent, and tried to spread the word of Daesh."We are ready to continue working as long as it is compatible with the conditions."A spokesman for the French military told AP that the attacker - who has not been named - had a connection to the Paris attacks."We don't know what the individual did, if it was a criminal or an extremist," Colonel Jean-Marc Aubert said.He added that they believe Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb had two aims: one was to get back at France and the other was "to bring down a regime, that is still very fragile to the extent that it is still trying to get a government in place".French officials believe there are links between the attacks and the Islamic State (IS) militant group, which declared	0
A California Republican official has apologized for sending an e-mail that depicts President Barack Obama as a young chimpanzee. "To my fellow Americans and to everyone else who has seen the e-mail I forwarded and was offended by my action, I humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness of my unwise behavior," Marilyn Davenport said in a statement obtained by CNN. Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the e-mail was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The e-mail contains a doctored photo of what appears to be a family portrait of two adult chimpanzees posing with a young chimpanzee with Obama's face pasted on it. The caption that ran with the photo says "Now you know why no birth certificate," the affiliate reported. Davenport said she would not repeat her error in the apology that included two Bible passages. "I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life," the statement said. "I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry." Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail. Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail. "There's no question the e-mail is racist. The only question is what was in Marilyn's heart, what was her intent. But I don't think there's anybody on her committee or anybody in the world really that doesn't see it as a racist," Baugh said on CNN's "AC360." Baugh said he feels Davenport should resign. "The bottom line is being sorry for something and having a sincere apology doesn't undo the action, it doesn't stop the consequences," Baugh said. "There's still consequences for what she's done and what she's done will continue to bring controversy to my party so I'm inclined to think at this time that she should still resign from the committee."

Former champion Angel Cabrera and America's Brandt Snedeker are tied for the lead after the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club. The 2009 champion from Argentina and Snedeker, who tied for third at Augusta in 2008, both shot three-under par rounds of 69 to finish on seven under par, one shot ahead of Australia's Adam Scott, who also shot 69 on Saturday. After a steady 16 holes, overnight leader Jason Day finished with two bogeys to slip back into a tie for fourth alongside another Australian Marc Leishman (72) with America's Matt Kuchar one shot further back after posting a 69 earlier in the day. Despite not having a spectacular day on the course, Tiger Woods still managed to grab the majority of the headlines. The world No.1 finished on three-under par, four shots off the lead, but began his day not knowing whether he'd be competing at all over the weekend following a rule violation at the par five 15th during Friday's second round. Speculation mounted on Saturday morning that Woods might be disqualified for taking a drop in the wrong place after his ball had ricocheted off the flagstick on 15th green and back into the water hazard at the front. But having sought an explanation from Woods, the Augusta National rules committee, who described him as "very forthright" and "honest," concluded that the four-time Masters champion should incur a two-stroke penalty. Woods ended up shooting a round of 70 and wasn't firing on all cylinders but is now well placed to mount a challenge in Sunday's final round. "I hit it all right today. I missed a few putts here and there. I had a few opportunities to shoot a lower score but the finish was huge - the last three saves certainly kept me in the ball game," Woods said. Woods is tied for seventh place with South Africa's Tim Clark whose five-under par round of 67 was the best of the day. America's Jim Furyk, Ricky Fowler and Steve Stricker are currently tied for ninth at two-under par alongside England's Lee Westwood and two-time champion, Germany's Bernhard Langer. China's teenage star Guan Tianlang battled his way to five-over par 77 to leave the 14-year-old amateur nine-over par for the tournament.	1
Two days after the death of Michael Jackson, the family of the pop superstar thanked his fans for their condolences and support in "one of the darkest moments of our lives." A girl holds up signs in memory of Michael Jackson outside New York's Apollo Theater on Saturday. "Please do not despair, because Michael will continue to live on in each and every one of you," family patriarch Joseph Jackson said in a statement to People magazine obtained by CNN. "Continue to spread his message, because that is what he would want you to do. Carry on, so his legacy will live forever," the statement told fans. "Our beloved son, brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon," the statement said. "It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times."  Watch how one fan mourns pop star » Family members including Jackson's mother, Katherine, were at the estate Jackson had rented in Holmby Hills. Around midday, two moving vans pulled up. One left empty, and the other apparently contained objects from the house. Other vehicles came and went, including a silver Range Rover driven by a plain clothes police officer. Meanwhile, the doctor who may have been the last person to see Michael Jackson alive was expected to meet with police Saturday along with his lawyer, an associate of attorney Ed Chernoff said. Matthew Alford, an associate of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, said Dr. Conrad Murray, who is represented by Chernoff, was upset but willing to cooperate.  Watch what Alford said about doctor's involvement » The ongoing meeting could spill into Sunday, according to the firm. "It's a human tragedy, and he's upset obviously over the loss of Mr. Jackson. But he is not a suspect in the death of Mr. Jackson," Alford said. "We intend to cooperate fully." Los Angeles police, who met briefly with Murray after Michael Jackson's death, had been trying to set up an interview, Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Charlie Beck said. "Is important to interview everybody that was in contact with Mr. Jackson immediately prior to his demise particularly anyone involved in his medical care," Beck said. "So it's extremely important to talk to his doctor." Police said the doctor has been cooperating.	1
It's the battle of the tech titans. No, not Apple versus Samsung. Sony has gone head-to-head with Microsoft after releasing their next-generation gaming platforms for the holiday shopping season. And according to a recent sales report, Sony's  PlayStation 4 has sold better than analysts are expecting.Sony Computer Entertainment America is the largest video game console sales company in the world. That kind of dominance translates to billions in revenues for a company that's been on the up and up since its founding in the 1980s. The company has just released a new report that highlights the success of its PlayStation 4 business.The report is the company's first since the release of the new console to be made public. In addition to its solid sales numbers, the report notes some intriguing facts.Despite a rough launch, Sony had a strong holiday season.But it was a different story in 2012.Here's what the report had to say:PlayStation 4PlayStation 4 sold a total of 14.13 million units during the company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, achieving a 7.2 percent annual sales growth rate, which was the greatest annual growth rate for the PlayStation 4 since the launch of the console in the United States in March 2012.PlayStation 4 sold a total of 16.13 million units during the company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. This was an annual sales growth rate of 7.6 percent, which was the greatest annual growth rate for the PlayStation 4 since the company launched the console in the United States in March 2010.There are no figures provided by Microsoft or Apple for their launch year of their respective platforms. Thus, this is the first ever report by a company that didn't launch their respective platforms in their respective respective years.The report also noted that all PS4 game sales are through digital downloads, which is up 14 percent.The PlayStation 4 has not only outsold the Xbox One, it outsold the Nintendo Wii, which was released in November of this year.But the report also noted that the two PlayStation 4's have different play styles.One thing to note is that PlayStation 4 games are available through the PlayStation Network's Instant Game Services. Those games can be downloaded and played on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U systems. The report didn't say if only PS4 games are purchased or both platforms are	0
My mother, Ms. Nippy Carville, was a woman of many talents. Two in particular stand out. She was a superb cook (the author of a successful cookbook), and she was an excellent bridge player. She always cautioned me that it was important  not to play bridge until I was at least fifty. She was right.My mother passed away several years ago. I remember many nights sitting with her when her heart had slowed down and she was not in pain. In the morning I would go to her room with her pain killers and pain relievers and bring her up so she could dress. She would put her robe on and make coffee. I always felt a bit nervous when I went in there to sit with her because of her physical discomfort. But it was a pleasant time in my life.That was before I began to write this essay. I do not recall many nights sitting in her room, but I must confess, I've often been alone and I've had time to reflect on my own life. I'd like to think that for a time, the pain medications did their job, and I was able to be with my mother. It's a thought that still haunts me at times.I remember my first writing class at school. I didn't care to sit in class, but the teacher encouraged me to write a poem. Well, one that I really felt, but not one that would win a state poem contest.The first poem I wrote that really made an impression on me was entitled "The Death of My Mother." That poem won second place in my first grade "Story of the Year" contest. I was proud of the poem and proud of my mother. The poem wasn't published, but it was printed in a local newspaper because of my mother. My mother felt I was showing enough courage to sit in and take notes during our school English class.The only experience I can recall during my early life that gave me pleasure was the Christmas caroling at my grandmother's house. We would sing a couple of carols and then she would take a turn reading the story of the Nativity found on Christmas Eve. After that she would take a turn reading the story of Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, the wise men, the wise women, the Magi, and the star. I can still see her sitting on the floor, holding a book and holding on tight to the book	0
then an alien art form in China  -- when he saw a videotaped version of CATS, which became the longest running musical in Broadway history. Fast forward three decades, and San Bao, who has enjoyed a successful career writing pop  culture commentary for The New York Times and other top media outlets, is working on a second book for the popular Broadway musical, based on the popular Broadway plays.The Musical's Director and Producer/Writer of the original Broadway production, David Henry Hwang, said: "Without his passion and love for this great musical, I doubt (San Bao) would be writing this biography. He is so incredibly dedicated to this new project and so creative and passionate in his writing that he is bringing to life a Broadway Musical that we believe in."I could not have made this work the way we have if I had not shared the story of my mother and the people she loved on stage. For me, it is an honor to tell this story after San Bao's passionate and touching life story. As a young actor, I am honored he trusted me with his story."His co-author, David Henry Hwang (Producer/Director of the original CATS), added: "Through his story of overcoming challenges, as well as an in depth knowledge of the many cultural customs in China, San Bao has woven in and out of aspects of Chinese life that are often overlooked. This is truly an amazing and exciting journey to tell and through this book we hope to help audiences connect with the life of one of our most fascinating cultural icons."In addition to his work in the cultural arena, San Bao has also made television appearances in ABC's "Shark Tank," "Jeopardy!" and on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"San Bao said, "I have always loved watching and reading about Chinese culture and the contributions that Chinese people have made to the world. This book is just an amazing piece of autobiography that takes me back to the past and through my research reveals the struggles that life has to deal with for a person who grew up in a communist society."Before taking on the difficult task of turning David Henry Hwang's life history into a book, San Bao had to make a film based on his book. The screenplay for the film was written by David Henry Hwang, San Bao's co-writer, and was produced by David Henry Hwang and directed	0
Republicans got first serve in their convention last week. Can Democrats break serve, or will the presidential race go to a tiebreaker in November? Here are five things to watch for at the Democratic National Convention: 1. New man on the big stage -- Most Americans have never heard of the mayor of San Antonio. They will after Tuesday night when Julian Castro becomes the first Latino to give the keynote address at a Democratic convention. Past keynote speakers such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made it to the White House. Maybe that's raising too many expectations for Castro, but his speech will be looked upon the same way. 2. 2016 contenders -- Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan gave blockbuster speeches at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's keynote address didn't go over as well. All three could make bids for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 if Mitt Romney doesn't win in November. So which Democrats are waiting in the wings? Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Brian Schweitzer of Montana and John Hickenlooper of Colorado all have an opportunity in Charlotte. 3. Turncoats -- Is Charlie Crist the Artur Davis of this convention? Davis, the former Democratic congressman from Alabama who seconded Obama's nomination four years ago, had a high-profile speech at the Republican convention. Now it's Crist's turn. What will the former Republican governor of Florida, who could possibly run for his old office as a Democrat, say when he gets in front of the podium in Charlotte? 4. What will Bill Clinton say? -- There's probably more anticipation, and questions, around the former president's Wednesday prime-time address. Once former adversaries when Hillary Clinton was running against Obama, Bill Clinton has become one of Obama's strongest advocates. But the big question is what will Clinton say when he nominates Obama for re-election Wednesday? Obama campaign officials said they haven't seen Clinton's speech yet, but they said they are "not worried" about what he'll say. 5. The ticket -- The traditional role of running mate is to be the attack dog. Will Vice President Joe Biden slam Romney as much as Ryan attacked Obama? And how much of what the president will say in his acceptance speech is a defense of his first term and how much is an outline of what he wants to do over the next four years?	1
Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is "very ill" and has been hospitalized, according to Cambridge University, where he is a professor. Stephen Hawking in Pasadena, California, in March. Cambridge University said the 67-year-old is "very ill and has been hospitalized for treatment." The university also said it believes Hawking is in "very serious but stable condition and following appropriate treatment is improving." Cambridge University said Hawking is receiving treatment at the Francis Crick Centre in London, England, and the University of Cambridge, where he is a professor of theoretical physics. It said in a statement that the university would be providing updates throughout the day. Hawking has been in California in March and March, but has been hospitalized on a number of occasions for medical reasons.A spokesman from the hospital where Hawking has been treated said he was "very ill and following appropriate treatment is improving," according to the BBC."Professor Hawking remains unwell and has been receiving medical treatment since his recent hospitalization in California, and is being cared for by specialists," the BBC said. "He is in very serious but stable condition and following appropriate treatment is improving," a statement from Cambridge University said.In a statement from Cambridge University, where Hawking is a professor of theoretical physics, the university said the 67-year-old is "very ill and has been hospitalized for treatment.""His colleagues at Cambridge University say he is in very serious but stable condition and following appropriate treatment is improving," the statement said.Hawking's illness seems to have been first reported by The Guardian on Saturday, according to the newspaper."Dr. Hawking has been hospitalised as a precaution after he suffered a seizure at home on Thursday," the newspaper said. "He has been unable to speak or breathe and his condition has deteriorated in the last hour. He is very ill and has been hospitalized for treatment.The hospital's director, Dr. James Broudy, said he was "obviously very disturbed to hear" reports of Hawking's condition.

Imagine a star so luminous that it would burn the Earth up if it were anywhere near, a star that outshines the sun as much as the sun outshines the moon. A monster even in the abyss of space. The star is not some scientist's celestial dream. Astronomers used a Very Large Telescope -- the instrument's official name -- to detect the most massive star discovered to date. In scientific lingo, it's a "hypergiant." Led by Paul Crowther, professor of astrophysics at England's University of Sheffield, the team of astronomers studied two young clusters of stars, NGC 3603 and RMC 136a. R136a1, found in the RMC 136a cluster, is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found, Crowther said Wednesday, with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun. It was born even heavier, with a solar mass of 320. Astronomers previously thought 150 to be the upper limit. Several of the stars studied had surface temperatures of 40,000 degrees, more than seven times hotter than the sun. R136a1 is rare and resides in another galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its home is more than 165,000 light years away from Earth's Milky Way galaxy. As such, said Crowther, it is not visible to the naked eye, nor with a rooftop telescope. "Owing to the rarity of these monsters, I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon," Crowther said. Crowther's team used the sophisticated infrared equipment on the Very Large Telescope in a European Southern Observatory facility in Chile as well as data collected from the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the colossal star. The telescope is considered the world's "biggest eye on the sky" and is 8 meters (26 feet) in diameter. The research was published in the current issue of the British scientific journal The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. "Unlike people, these kind of stars are massive when they are babies," Crowther told CNN. "They lose weight as they get older." At over a million years old, the star is already middle-aged, Crowther said, and could easily be a poster child for WeightWatchers, having shed a fifth of its initial mass over time because of powerful winds.	1
Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. If you've rolled up your sleeves and gotten experience, tell potential employers when applying for a job. Talk to a dozen students on any college campus and you're likely to hear a dozen different perspectives on what they hope to get out of college. Some want high GPAs; some want to get into the work force and earn a lot of money. Ask their parents and you'll get just as many different answers. Some parents hope that their children earn their degree and have an easy time finding a job. Others want them to be at the top of the class so they can get into the best graduate school possible. And some just want their children to stop partying long enough to attend class once in a while. Ask employers what they want from graduates and the answers are equally diverse. Depending on the job, you might need a degree and an internship, a degree and work experience, or the right connections to even land an interview. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 39 million Americans over the age of 18 have a bachelor's degree. Considering that 281 million people live in the country, college graduates are still a small percentage of the population. Still, with a number in the millions, you are competing with a lot of job seekers who also have the same educational background as you. Relying only on your bachelor's to land a job is not the safest route to employment. As with most things, it's all in the presentation. Degree or not, presentation matters Sue Chehrenegar studied biology as an undergraduate and biomedical research as a graduate student. During her job search, she found herself losing out on job opportunities because she lacked the proper experience, despite her education. Or so she thought. "At the end of the 1980s, I spent more than one year looking for a job," she remembers. "I kept getting this question: 'Have you done anything in the area of molecular biology?'" She would tell employers that she didn't have the proper experience because she wasn't specifically trained for that. "I did not mention the fact that I once assisted a graduate student who was putting DNA and RNA into cultured cells."	1
We were like David against Goliath. We fought long and hard, and in the end we prevailed. After 14 long years in the dustbins of Congress, mainly due to strong opposition from the Catholic Church, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill was approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Monday, 17 December 2012. Indeed, there is no force more powerful than an idea whose time has come. And the time for a Philippine reproductive health law is now. The Philippines remains one of the poorest countries in the world because, among other things, for a long time, it refused to acknowledge what could easily be seen when one glances out the window: the country desperately needs a reproductive health law. Not having a reproductive health law is cruelty to the poor. The poor are miserable because, among other reasons, they have so many children. Providing reproductive knowledge and information through government intervention is the humane thing to do. It can help the poor escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives, plan their families and control their procreative activities. The phrase "reproductive rights" includes the idea of being able to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination, coercion or violence. Many poor women do not receive information on how to receive reproductive health care.  Our underprivileged women have to accept standards lower than what they need, want, or deserve. According to the Department of Health, the mortality rate for Filipino mothers increased to 221 per 100,000 live births in 2011 from 162 per 100,000 live births in 2009. But not only do the women suffer, the children do, too. The children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices. In short, the bill merely wants to empower a Filipino woman from the poorest economic class to march to the nearest facility operated by the Department of Health or the local government unit, to demand information on a family planning product or supply of her choice.  The bill, at the simplest level, wants to give an indigent married woman the freedom of informed choice concerning her reproductive rights.	1
Chemical dispersants keep flowing into the Gulf of Mexico at virtually unchanged levels despite the Environmental Protection Agency's order to BP to "significantly" scale back, according to a CNN analysis of daily dispersant ips. The orders, which BP ignored, were "no more than paperwork" that did nothing to stem the leak that has killed 11 workers and caused $20 billion in damage. BP has already spent $40 million on the dispersant ips, according to a former BP manager. BP is also under pressure to release internal documents which it has refused to turn over to the federal government. But if BP had to pay for the dispersant ips, the government could have taken other steps including putting its own workers and the environment at greater risk.Here's how CNN broke this story:(CNN) -- The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is getting worse and now shows no sign of stopping. CNN's Scott en Epps reports on the state of the situation and the company's refusal to make an effort to fight the leak.Scott en Epps, CNN, New OrleansCNN has learned a huge amount about the BP oil gusher from several sources. We now have three independent sources who have given us a picture of what's actually happening. They tell a different story. There are many points of view on this issue. Now is the time to hear from those sources.This is a story of an oil spill that should have never happened. This is a story of a company that was warned about, in writing, the potential for an oil disaster in the Gulf.This is the story of a company that was sued several times by the government for not doing enough to stop a spill.This is also the story of a government that has failed to act because it believes in a system of doing nothing.These are the facts CNN has learned:BP has spent $40 million on dispersant to stop the oil leak that's been caused by the Deepwater Horizon explosion.BP has failed, not only to stop the leak, but to do a much better job controlling the spill.BP didn't even bother to notify the federal government of the leak, and that's the government that told BP to do more.BP still hasn't been ordered to pay for the dispersant ips.BP has yet to even report to law enforcement agencies that a	0
One of the most highly anticipated apps for Apple devices was made available on Wednesday. At least, until it wasn't. Google announced a Gmail app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch that was designed to make it easier for the service's more than 190 million users to navigate their mail. "We check email pretty much everywhere these days," Google content manager Matthew Izatt wrote on the Gmail blog. "And when we do, we want easy access to our important messages so we can respond quickly and get back to life -- or slinging birds at thieving green pigs." Users of Apple's operating system could already access Gmail through a mobile site or set it up as their default e-mail account. But the new app promised a smoother experience with a host of new features. The tech blogosphere was delighted. "Go get the iPhone app for Gmail!" popular blogger Robert Scoble wrote on his Google+ page. Then, a few minutes passed. "UPDATE: DO NOT. The Gmail app is really a piece of crud," he wrote. "Not worth loading. Very disappointed." Google had obviously already noticed what Scoble did. Shortly after it was unveiled, the app was pulled from the Apple Store. "The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications," Google posted on its Gmail Twitter account. "We have pulled the app to fix the problem. Sorry we messed up." Later, a fuller explanation was added to the original blog post. "Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS," Google posted. "Unfortunately, it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app. We've removed the app while we correct the problem, and we're working to bring you a new version soon. Everyone who's already installed the app can continue to use it." The app ... at least the fully working version of it ... will send push notifications and sound cues when new messages are received, search your inbox for an e-mail, autocomplete e-mail addresses and upload photos to messages. It will also feature the same Priority Inbox that Gmail's Web version has and add a new mobile interface that will allow users to navigate their inbox more quickly with touch controls. There was no word from Google Wednesday afternoon as to when the fixed app might be back up.	1
Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Paris on Sunday decrying the French president's plan to legalize same-sex marriage and adoptions. They converged near the Eiffel Tower, chanting and waving flags, posters and balloons. "I do not personally agree with gay marriage as I am a Christian and believe what the Bible says about marriage being between one woman and one man for a life time," said CNN iReporter Oluwasegun Olowu-Davies, who shot video of the march with his phone. "If your lifestyle doesn't allow you to conceive, there is a reason," he said. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. After his win, the Cabinet approved a draft bill that is expected to go before the National Assembly and Senate soon. It is likely to be voted on in February or March. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. The plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Same-sex marriage around the world Opening up marriage to same-sex couples "would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone," he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a "deceit" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups in France, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and more than 100 lawmakers are against the legislation, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Hundreds of mayors around the country have also voiced their opposition, which has won wide backing from gay rights advocates. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT said the law, if passed, "would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights." Lawmakers have a "unique opportunity" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. "The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity," it said.	1
Dumpster-lined streets and sidewalks strewn with destroyed art hint at the damage Hurricane Sandy wreaked on New York's most important art district last week; but as electricity slowly returns and flood waters recede, the impact of the ernest and most visible of New York's post-industrial disasters is beginning to appear in other ways. Like every other place of high commerce in Manhattan, the area around the Museum of Modern Art has been transformed by the force of nature.The art market is as much a part of the daily life of New York as anything else in the city. Artists who live and work downtown have to pay rent, buy food and transport. Artists work in the city's galleries and museums, many of them also paying rent. A large proportion of the city's art galleries are located here. There are art museums (e.g. the Bronx Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the MoMA) in nearby Manhattan, but this area is the only one that is part of an urban city with strong art culture and a robust economy.This is not what happened in New York after Hurricane Sandy caused severe damage to the Museum of Modern Art on October 29th. There are, of course, some artists who moved to the East River and other parts of the city (e.g. the Brooklyn Museum) and established homes there, but for the vast majority of the art world in New York, that was not the case.New York's Museum of Modern Art was flooded with artworks including works by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Miró, Duchamp and, most famously, Jackson Pollock. These and other works were rescued after the hurricane on Thursday, November 1st. The New York Times and Art In America have since published an interview with artist John Armleder, who describes the flooding and damage: "The museum had a lot of water on the floor. The flooding took away all the flooring. We're talking about 20-35 feet of wetness," he says.The loss of the museum, the sale of the most-expensive painting in the US last week: the $450 million Pollock, and the losses suffered by the arts community in New York (which many attribute to the failure to prepare for a hurricane in New York) show the importance of the art market to New York.In fact, the art market in New York is not only the world's	0
Hosni Mubarak's fall from power a year ago stunned the world -- three decades of iron-clad rule ended in 17 days by an unexpected groundswell of popular protests. A banner headline in the Al-Ahram newspaper said: "The people have toppled the regime." But in the year that followed, Egyptians increasingly realized that what they ousted was one man, not the military that stood behind him. And they grew bitterly frustrated at what they perceive as the slow pace of change. Saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in Egypt as America's top military officer was in Cairo to meet with his Egyptian counterparts. On the table for discussion was the fate of 16 Americans who are among 43 foreigners working for civil society institutions who are to be tried in Egypt for receiving illegal foreign funding. And possibly the fate of U.S. military aid, conditioned now on the progress of Egypt's transition to democracy. The United States viewed the legal proceedings against the foreigners as a crackdown, another sign that autocracy has hardly departed Egypt. Many Egyptians would probably agree. On the first anniversary of Mubarak's departure, the plan was to voice their frustration, though Saturday came and went without the ceremony that was anticipated on such a day. Activists kicked off a general strike, hoping for the kind of large protests that made Tahrir Square a familiar name. But the demonstrations were scattered and light. "A year later, nothing has changed. We have been facing the same regime, if worse," prominent activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Saturday. Ibrahim said farmers, students and workers will help "settle this revolution once and for all." "Many people ... don't know what actually toppled Mubarak was the last three days of those 17 days when large numbers of workers in different sectors went on strike," she said from Cairo. The Egypt Revolutionaries' Alliance, comprised of democratic and secular political groups, called for the immediate dismantling of the interim government and immediate presidential elections. It also demanded the dismissal of the prosecutor general, and a purge and overhaul of the Interior Ministry that came to be despised during last year's revolt and again last week as anger mounted over a deadly stampede at a soccer match. The alliance said a committee should be formed to to investigate any crimes by Egypt's new rulers while revolutionary tribunals should try former regime figures.	1
Gael Monfils saved five match points before beating top seed Roger Federer 7-6 6-7 7-6 to reach the final of the Paris Masters on Saturday. The home hero will play Robin Soderling for the title after the Swede beat   Andy Roddick , 6-3 3-6 7-6 6-2.If Monfils wins, he will play Federer in the French Open final and it would be the first time that the two have met in a major or Masters.In an incredible display of sportsmanship on the day of the final, Monfils and Federer made themselves available as substitutes for the French Open final, a tournament in which they already had lost the previous five finals they played.The French Open title is especially significant for a man who has been the most dominant player in the sport's recent history. However, he has struggled in major finals before – against fellow World No. 1s Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – and would need to find a way to overcome his nemesis."I didn't have a choice, I just had to play," said Monfils. "I know I have to work very hard but I don't mind. I've been through some tough tournaments this year and now it's going to really be tough next year and for the rest of my career.""It's great. These guys are very nice but I'm sure they'll do the right way," said his father, Georges Monfils, who said his son would win the tournament.Monsieur Monfils is trying to set a record as the first father-son pair to reach the final of a major. The men's final at Roland Garros is due on Sunday afternoon.On a day when rain was forecast for the final round, Monfils was at his best with a 14-4 lead in the fifth set. It was when Federer began to turn the game around that Monfils would finally get the monkey off his back. The two would combine for four breaks of serve to take the set.With a 5-4 lead, Monfils would make a double-faulting error on his forehand. He then fell behind 5-4 in the third set. He made two double-faults to hand Federer a break in the second game."	0
Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity. Pinera visited the mine Sunday and spoke with the trapped workers. He also presented their families with a copper plate engraved with the words miners first used to tell rescuers they were alive, "We're fine, in the shelter, all 33." "This is all politics. It's dirty. It's trickery and propaganda. They're playing with the feelings of our loved ones," said Nelly Bugueno, mother of trapped miner Victor Zamora. The mine rescue appears to have boosted Pinera's popularity at a time when he was under fire in other parts of the country. In the south of Chile, Pinera is battling a hunger strike by 34 Mapuche Indians, part of the indigenous group's ongoing campaign for independence. Along the central and southern coast, some Chileans accuse the government of being too slow to rebuild after the February earthquake and tsunami. But his overall approval rating surged to 56 percent in August, according to a survey by Adimark GfK, a 10 percent increase over the July numbers. The Chilean research company said the increase was "directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the San Jose mine." When the workers first sent word that they were alive, Pinera triumphantly waved their written note before television cameras. Sunday was his fifth visit to the mine. Outside the mine Sunday, some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle. "We know politicians want to show off, but I don't care about the politics. All I care about is that the president gets our boys out," said Cristina Nunez, wife of miner Claudio Yanez. The sister of another trapped miner accused rescuers of delaying the switch-on of a recently-assembled oil rig -- the so-called Plan C drill -- until Pinera arrived Sunday. She also claimed rescuers discovered the miners were alive in an underground shelter in the early hours of August 22, but waited until midday to officially announce the news, after Pinera arrived at the mine. She declined to be named for fear of losing her job for anti-government comments. "We're still not free in Chile to speak our mind," she said.	1
Libyan authorities have made more arrests in connection with the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead, the president of Libya's parliament said Sunday. Mohamed al-Magariaf, the head of Libya's General National Congress, said around 50 people have been arrested, though another senior government official said the number was not that high. The official said as many as 50 people have been brought in for questioning but not all of them were arrested. They were people who were at a protest outside the consulate but there was no indication yet that they took part in the violence, he said. Ambassador's last moments Al-Magariaf told CBS' "Face the Nation" that a "few" of those arrested are foreigners, some of them from Mali and Algeria. The others are affiliated with al Qaeda or are sympathizers, he said. Al-Magariaf said he has "no doubt" the fatal attack was planned and not a result of the anti-American demonstrations that began that day -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. "Definitely it was planned by foreigners, by people who entered the country a few months ago, and they were planning this criminal act since their arrival," he said. The senior Libyan government official said there is no evidence yet that the attack was planned or that al Qaeda was involved. U.S. officials believe extremists carried out the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, but that they did it after a spontaneous protest began outside the building, said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned," Rice told "Face the Nation." Zakaria: Protests don't tell the whole story The FBI is investigating the attack but has yet to enter the country because of volatility there. In the meantime, FBI agents are interviewing witnesses outside Libya, federal law enforcement officials said. The United States has, however, deployed warships and surveillance drones in its hunt for the killers, and a contingent of 50 Marines has arrived to boost the security of Americans in Libya. Militants stormed the consulate in Benghazi on Tuesday, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The protest in front of the consulate was over a film, made in the United States, that mocks the Prophet Mohammed.	1
Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show. The material was part of more than 46,000 pages released by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. Kagan was a top lawyer in the administration's Office of Domestic Policy. At issue at the time was a bill in the Republican-controlled Congress that would ban a type of abortion performed in the second trimester. Critics of the procedure called it "partial-birth" abortion. In a February 27, 1997 memo to top White House staff, Kagan notes a leading abortion rights supporter had just admitted late-term abortions were being "performed more frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged, and often perfonned [sic - performed] on healthy women with healthy fetuses," repeating a claim conservatives at the time had long made. Kagan advises "it would be a great mistake to challenge" the statements of Ron Fitzsimmons, then executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. Nonetheless, Kagan said the controversy did not undermine the president's stated position that he would support the GOP bill with some exceptions. "The president's position today remains what it has always been," wrote Kagan, "that he will sign a bill banning partial-birth abortions, but only if it has an exception that will protect those women -- even if few in number -- who need this procedure to save their lives or prevent serious harm to their health." The Supreme Court three years ago affirmed a similar federal ban on the procedure, passed by Congress in 2003. That bill did not include a "health exception." Kagan in her memos at the time repeatedly used the term "partial-birth" favored by anti-abortion groups and one which abortion-rights activists had tried to replace, believing it was inaccurate and inflammatory. The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House. He is now President Obama's chief of staff. Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee have sought a delay in Kagan's confirmation hearings, scheduled for the week of June 28, saying this latest batch of documents gives them little time to learn about her views on hot-button social and legal issues.	1
Hundreds of thousands of Chicago schoolchildren will return to class Wednesday after the teachers union voted to suspend its strike. About 800 union officers and delegates met for just over two hours before there was an overwhelming voice illsendes to strike.The main issues at stake were salary increases, better working conditions and an end to the current system of assigning classroom work to different teachers.The state superintendent of schools and the union agreed on $20 per hour salary increases but the union took issue with conditions of the school system in terms of teacher aides, teacher quality and the number of schools that receive high-stakes standardized tests. Teachers believe that the current system of assigning work puts an unnecessary burden on their lives.Union leaders were disappointed with the offer and are considering whether to continue the current walkout scheduled to start at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. But they said they hope that the public will support them in continuing despite the setback.Many Chicago schoolchildren will be back in school on Wednesday, which is National Teacher Appreciation Day.The strike deadline and the results were made public just before 10 a.m. But they were made public after about 75,000 people had signed an online form in support of the strike.The strike is expected to continue on Thursday as the union continues its request to have the contract declared unenforceable.Union officials said last week that they expect the strike to remain a fight until Friday at the earliest. But there were indications Tuesday afternoon that school staff might be returning to work by Thursday. But the union would not confirm this and is not releasing a list of schools where it wants to return to classes as it is concerned that not enough staff would be available."We are going to honor the teachers as they decide what to do in the next week and days," said union spokesman Bob King.School officials, including the director of the Chicago public schools, have offered varying numbers of teachers who would be available to replace those who walk off the job."As of right now, we are not sure who those teachers will be," King said. "We expect as we get closer to Wednesday that we will have a better idea."Union officials, however, were not sure of the number of available replacements and would not give a specific number."We are prepared to go back to work if we want to," King said.

In a decision many might consider a blow to freedom of dissent in Egypt, one of the nation's most popular comedians, Bassem Youssef, announced on Monday his political satirical show will no longer air on Egyptian TV. Youssef didn't offer a detailed explanation for his decision but suggested outside pressure and a fear for his safety were factors. "I'm tired of struggling and worrying about my safety and that of my family," Youssuf said at a news conference inside a Cairo theater where he performed his weekly show. Youssef shot to fame during Egypt's 2011 revolution when he mocked former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak on his homemade political satire show -- shot in his laundry room and posted on YouTube. His show "El Barnameg" -- "The Program" in Arabic -- drew more than 5 million viewers in three months. One year later later, Youssef had his own show on Egyptian TV where he derided Mubarak's replacement, Islamist President Mohamed Morsy. By then, Youssef had gained worldwide recognition and was regularly compared to American political comedian Jon Stewart. In April 2013, Time magazine named Youssef one of its 100 Most Influential Men in the World. Several months later, Egyptian broadcaster CBC pulled the plug on Youssef when he poked fun at the almost cult-like adoration of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- the former Army chief who is now Egypt's President- elect. Youssef made a comeback in February when Saudi-owned Egyptian broadcaster MBC began airing his show. Once again, he drew huge ratings and laughs with carefully crafted back-handed jokes aimed at the army chief. Youssef's return was cut short before Egypt's presidential election campaign last month when MBC announced the show would be on hiatus so that "Egyptian voters' orientation and public opinion won't be influenced." But the show never returned to air as scheduled on May 30. The end of Youssef's show will likely fuel concern among international rights groups and pro-democracy activists who have increasingly accused Egyptian authorities of stifling dissent and freedom of speech. "In a nutshell, we've gone as far as we can," Youssef said. "We are tired of moving from one network to another network and being under emotional pressure." Bassem Youssef: 'Sarcasm is a weapon'	1
Long before U2 and Bono blazed their own paths, and decades before the Christian music industry became a half-billion-dollar annual business, a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way. Larry Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song. Larry Norman was a Christian rock musician before the genre existed, combining faith with a backbeat and social consciousness. Think of him as rock music's street preacher, often referred to as "the father of Christian rock." "Between 1969 and 1979, Larry Norman was the Christian rock scene's answer to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Mick Jagger," said Emmy-nominated director David Di Sabatino, who takes a critical look at Norman's career and life in his documentary "Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman." "He set the standard. He created the space for others to exist. ... The vision he created for where Christian rock music could go still resonates today." The documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early 2010. Norman hit the U.S. music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. His first solo album, "Upon This Rock," came out in late 1969, after he left the band People! The San Francisco Bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a Top 20 hit with a cover of the Zombies' "I Love You." It was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti-Vietnam War protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at Woodstock. As many Americans looked for answers, Norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major-label debut. "It was a pretty gutsy move to sing about Jesus on his first record," younger brother Charles Norman said. "To take a chance on mentioning Jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step." " 'Upon This Rock' was written to stand outside the Christian culture," Larry Norman said in an interview with CCM magazine. "My songs weren't written for Christians. ... I was saying, 'I'm going to present the Gospel, and I'm not going to say it like you want. This album is not for you.' " No small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream.	1
In a first for the prestigious organization, a Nobel Prize will go to a man who died just days before being named a winner. Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He would have won half the prize of approximately $1.5 million; the other half will be shared by scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann. Steinman died of pancreatic cancer Friday at the age of 68, after having extended his life using a kind of therapy he designed, his university said in a statement Monday. The Nobel committee was unaware of his death. Had they known, their own rules would have precluded him being selected as a winner. The decision was made Monday, just before the announcement, Nobel officials said. "The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize," the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate. Making the decision meant circumventing one of the Nobel rules. The Nobel Prize website states that since 1974, rules have stipulated that a prize "cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement." In its statement Monday, the Nobel Assembly said it interpreted "the purpose of the rule" as making sure no one is "deliberately" awarded the prize posthumously. Because the committee did not know of Steinman's death, the decision "was made in good faith," the assembly said. The Nobel committee also expressed "deep sadness and regret" at the news. Speaking to CNN, Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Nobel assembly overseeing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, said the fact that Steinman didn't know he would win "adds to the sadness." Hansson said that after the committee chose the winners Monday, he tried to call Steinman to inform him of the good news. Rockefeller University said Steinman "discovered the immune system's sentinel dendritic cells and demonstrated that science can fruitfully harness the power of these cells and other components of the immune system to curb infections and other communicable diseases." "He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four years ago, and his life was extended using a dendritic cell-based immunotherapy of his own design," the university said in a statement.	1

Bollywood movie star Dev Anand, a fixture in the Indian film industry for decades, has died of an apparent heart attack, CNN IBN reported Sunday. He was 88. Anand died in a London hotel Saturday night, his family said. The legendary Indian actor was known for his roles in a series of movies, including "Johnny Mera Naam," "Des Pardes" and "Hare Rama Hare Krishna." Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered his condolences Sunday. "Dev Anand was a great artist who entertained generations of cinema lovers over five decades," Singh said in a statement, according to CNN IBN. "He was an embodiment of a life long passion for acting and film making. I join millions of his fans in mourning his death." The star, who was known for his good looks and leading roles in romantic movies, released his book, "Romancing with Life" in 2007.	1
After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the  Boston Marathon last spring.The first two weeks of deliberations will feature testimony from Tsarnaev’s brother, Tamerlan, and their friend and fellow Muslim convert, Nadir Hamid. Each testified about how the brothers spent the days leading up to the Boston bombing when they were still living at their family’s modest home in Cambridge, Mass., about 30 miles north of Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 19, is also charged with conspiring with his 26-year-old brother to carry out the bombings on April 15, two days after the marathon. His trial, originally set to begin Sept. 25, was rescheduled for Friday at the request of prosecutors.Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers each have agreed to three days of argument before the jury, but Tsarnaev’s lawyers have said that the three-day period will be largely devoted to summarizing the arguments of the prosecution and emphasizing the government’s case against their client.The jury has been told that Tsarnaev has spent most of his adult life in the United States and has no criminal record.But his brother, after spending much of his time in Dagestan, the Chechen region of Russia, where his father is a powerful warlord, made his debut in the United States in 2004, after flying from Moscow.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born in Cambridge in 1993, the second son of a professor and his wife. Tsarnaev joined the MIT club that year and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. Tsarnaev was then accepted into the Harvard T.H.U.D. program, which was aimed at helping young Russian citizens immigrate to the United States and become American citizens.After receiving his degree, Tsarnaev became friendly with friends from the Dagestan region, then a part of the Russian Federation. One of them was Hamid, a student at Harvard who grew up a U.S. citizen born in Pakistan. Tsarnaev became acquainted with Hamid through his friend’s sister, a nurse who often visited Cambridge and had a social relationship with Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev met Hamid in July 2012, as it turned out, through one of their Harvard friends: Nadir, who was working in Cambridge.	0
Here's what you need to know about Sean Collier, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus cop who was shot to death by the suspected Boston Marathon bombers. When he went hiking with the MIT Outing Club, he brought extra ear plugs for others to block out snoring in the crowded mountain cabin. When his car got hit by a swerving vehicle, Collier immediately went to check if the other driver was injured. Even those who barely knew him filled a tribute page set up Friday with memories of his easy laugh and ever-present smile, his desire to help others and his motivation to be a good police officer. "He had a really great smile. I'll always remember that," Kristina Lozoya, a student volunteer with the MIT emergency medical service, told CNN. "He was always laughing. He loved his job." Carin King, another volunteer with the service that runs the campus ambulance, told CNN that Collier "went out of his way" to get to know the student emergency medical technicians (EMTs). "A few months ago he was on a call with me where the patient was very seriously ill," King related in an e-mail. "He followed up with the family and then stopped by our bunkroom to look for me every day for a week so he could let me know that our patient was now OK." On Thursday night, when news emerged that an MIT officer had been shot, King sent Collier an e-mail "to make sure he was OK." She never got an answer. "I figured I was being overly cautious," King added. "It's truly a heartbreaking situation." Such a connection reflected the 27-year-old Massachusetts native's approach to police work. While his brother, Andrew, became a machinist in the engine department at Hendrick Motorsports, one of the major NASCAR racing teams, Sean followed a different path. "Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling," MIT Police Chief John DiFava said in a statement posted on the university website. "He was born to be a police officer." Collier died a police officer, shot to death in his squad car on the MIT campus. In a statement Friday, his family asked for privacy.	1
Phone hacking was widespread at the Daily Mirror newspaper when Piers Morgan was its editor, a former employee testified Wednesday, stopping just short of saying Morgan definitely knew about it. James Hipwell said that he "cannot prove" that Morgan knew about illegal eavesdropping, but that it was "very unlikely he did not know what was going on." Phone hacking "happened every day" at the Mirror's show business desk in late 1999, Hipwell told the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices. Also on Wednesday, Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills accused Morgan of using her as a "scapegoat." Morgan, who now hosts the CNN talk show "Piers Morgan Tonight," testified the previous day that he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid. Speaking by video link, Morgan tenaciously defended himself against accusations that he knew more about phone hacking than he has admitted in the past. Some of the toughest questioning focused on a story based on a voice message McCartney left for his then-wife Mills, trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her. Morgan refused to say who played the message for him or where, but admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail. "Did you know that was unethical?" demanded Robert Jay, the lead lawyer for the inquiry. "Not unethical, no. It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical," Morgan said. Mills Wednesday appeared to try to shoot down speculation that she herself had played the recording for Morgan, after Judge Brian Leveson said only she could legally have given permission for him to hear it and threatened to call her to give evidence. "I can categorically state that I have never ever played Piers Morgan a tape of any kind, never mind a voice message from my ex-husband," she said on her website. Morgan declined to respond. "Piers Morgan has no additional comments re: the Leveson Inquiry or Heather Mills. His written statement and the complete transcript from the Inquiry can be found online," wrote a representative. In August, Mills told the BBC that a journalist working for a Mirror Group publication admitted hacking her voice mail. She said a senior Mirror Group Newspapers journalist phoned her and "started quoting verbatim the messages from my machine."	1
One of the biggest holiday weeks is upon us. Thanksgiving is a favorite day for football fans, close-knit families, families who can't stand each other, and of course, amateur competitive eaters. But what's really icky about December is that it's the season when many people try to make new traditions in their homes, and fail.Instead of hosting a typical Thanksgiving dinner, many moms (and dads) are having one of two types of Thanksgiving meals: one at home, or with the family. The family version is more family bonding, and the home version is more personal and romantic.Both Thanksgiving meals are a great way for parents to get some time together with their children without feeling like they're "just eating dinner." This is a time of year when families can find a bit of time to be together, and spend quality time with each other. When you're away from your family during this time of year, you tend to spend more time at work -- and we all know how that last thing is supposed to go.But there's one thing the home version of Thanksgiving might lack: it's not a football game. Most people in America just don't watch football on Thanksgiving. And if you don't know for a fact that you'll get the chance to watch your favorite team, then it's not the perfect meal.No Turkey But That Doesn't Mean You Don't Get To Watch turkeyThere's no denying that the meal that has become Thanksgiving tradition is a delicious, traditional meal that serves as a delicious reminder of what makes America great: family. We're all looking forward to our first Thanksgiving, but it's not a holiday for just sitting around eating.That's the fun part of the food. It's a game. And it's a competition. And because the whole point of the game is to show that we've got some talent, and we're competitive, we're actually competing against each other.The goal of Thanksgiving dinner isn't to get people to sit down and watch football. You're not competing against one another to see who's got the best football knowledge. It's a dinner where the food is intended to remind us of how good our family is.The family version of Thanksgiving is a great time, but it can still be better for the whole family.Get the Turkey RightThis is a great opportunity to find out more	0
Singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening, a spokesman said. The accident happened in Santa Ynez, California, near where Crosby lives. Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, according to California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy. The posted speed limit was 55. The jogger suffered multiple fractures, and was airlifted to a hospital in Santa Barbara, Clotworthy said. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening. "Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way. Mr. Crosby did not see the jogger because of the sun," said Clotworthy. According to the spokesman, the jogger and Crosby were on the same side of the road. Pedestrians are supposed to be on the left side of the road walking toward traffic, Clotworthy said. Joggers are considered pedestrians. Crosby is known for weaving multilayered harmonies over sweet melodies. He belongs to the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash. "David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone. And, based off of initial reports, he is relieved that the injuries to the gentleman were not life threatening," said Michael Jensen, a Crosby spokesman. "He wishes the jogger a very speedy recovery."	1

Tucked away in this small mountain village, off a dusty road flanked by pig farms, is where the earliest case of swine flu -- a virus spreading globally -- was confirmed. Five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, known as ery, was diagnosed with swine flu at the public health clinic. The family -- Edgar's parents, brothers and sisters -- had never heard of swine flu. Edgar was too young to know what it was or why his family was experiencing it. The first thing the family did after learning Edgar had the virus was to send home an ultrasound, to learn how far along he was.A tiny red line appeared on the ultrasound at around five weeks, indicating Edgar was pregnant. Edgar could not have known at the time whether he was going to have a boy or girl. Edgar's parents -- who are undocumented immigrants -- had been in a relationship for seven years. Edgar and his two brothers were always around. The oldest brother, Antonio, was in the Army; the youngest, Felipe, was an elementary school student and a member of the baseball team at Guadalupe High School. Edgar and Felipe would fight over the television remote control or the video games; it was always the older brother that got the last word."There was always tension, because sometimes the oldest brother would be like, 'Yo, the youngest brother, he's the one that takes care of his sister,'" Edgar's mother, Josefina Hernandez, told BuzzFeed News. "So there was always tension in the family."On February 25, 2012, the day Edgar was diagnosed, he spent five hours in the clinic. The diagnosis of swine flu, a kind of seasonal influenza, meant Edgar's days at school were over. Josefina would take Edgar to the park in the afternoon to play."To say that it was hard, you know? Because I didn't know what it was, but we went home and I told Edgar, and he's like, 'It's swine flu. It's going to kill me,'" Josefina recalled. "I said, 'Let me call my boyfriend, let me call my mom, let me call my dad, let me call my brother, and let's go pray.' And he said, 'Hey, what are you doing? Let me go and see you.' And I was, like, 'No, no, no. Let me call	0
He was a beefy 5-foot-10 but won an Oscar for playing the slight, 5-foot-3 Truman Capote. He had the booming voice of a deity but often played schlubs and conflicted characters. He could be heartfelt and ersatz, as he was as a young man, when he played an old man in a remake of the movie _Bonnie and Clyde_. He was very rich, having been born into a very wealthy family, but he often dressed in $500 suits and ate at $3,000 restaurants. He was not very funny, as shown when he was playing a guy who gets married to the wrong woman and gets her to leave him the second time. The scene is full of irony and wit. He is very vain and likes to be showered with love. He was in a hit in 1975 called _Love Story_ and won in 1980 for _A Few hours with You_. As the title of his autobiography implies, he didn't have a lot of luck in his personal life. He was married for about three-quarters of his life, had five ex-wives, and four children. He was very religious on the whole, but he was also anti-drugs and anti-abortion. His voice, which was often very hoarse and nasal, made him sound slightly crazy.I met Billy Wilder in the summer of 1993, in Paris. In a cab, I found myself talking to him in Italian. He used to go to a place called Ristorante Italiano for lunch. I asked him if he'd like to have lunch with me at an Italian restaurant somewhere. He would later tell me he wasn't quite sure why I had asked that favor. I said I thought we could have a lot of fun if we sat there and ate pasta with olive oil. I told him that we had so many Italian movies that we could use up the days at the movies. We sat together. I think he was still somewhat taken aback when I told him to sit down and not to worry about the pasta, because he would be eating like a pig, and he loved it. He loved talking to me, because I was an intelligent, interesting guy who was interested to hear an Italian's opinion on Italian movies. I am a fan of Italian movies myself, and it is fun to talk to an Italian about them. I told him that _Goodfellas_ was one of the best movies in the	0
Under Christmas trees around the world, parcels of underpants and bundles of briefs are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of dismay -- by the men in your life. Underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list Â— especially underwear for men.For the uninitiated, what's the difference between a man's underwear and women's underwear?In layman's terms, men's underwear is made exclusively for them. Women's underwear is a generic term for everything, from t-shirts to underwear to socks, which the women in your life have apparently stolen from their fellow man, who doesn't deserve socks.The undergarment business is a hot and lucrative one worldwide. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that men's underclothing manufacturing employs about 2.1 million people, making them the largest category of the consumer goods industry, which employs about 160 million people on net (and that's just the clothing industry alone). It is the primary sector used to make all the other types of goods in the U.S. economy, from cars and tractors to office equipment and electronics.So, men's underwear, like so many things in the U.S. we're told, is made to fit big, wide, hairy men."Underwear for Women"Actually, underwear for women is made to fit women. But in the case of men's undergarments, they're made for a much different purpose. In fact, for many women, men's undergarments are the only underwear they own.In a 2005 "Consumer Reports" survey, only 19 percent of men and women said that male garments fit them correctly. Even men who own clothing that fits their body type (and don't know it) rate their own undergarments as very or somewhat poorly."I know that, generally speaking, our underwear is not up to the standards of a lot of women's underwear. And I tend to go in the opposite direction to a lot of women in having an understanding that women's underwear is made to fit women. And a lot of them don't fit."The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that women's undergarments are, on average, four to six sizes smaller than men's. More than 98 percent of women's undergarments are at least an inch (the metric equivalent of a	0
The top military and civilian leaders of the U.S. Air Force were forced out Thursday over the handling of nuclear weapons, the Defense Department secretary said. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.

Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley, left, and Secretary Michael Wynne have iced out the service’s top civilian leaders. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)WASHINGTON (AP) — In early April, when the first atomic bombs at Bikini Island were dropped, the United States was at war and the Cold War was on full display.U.S. nuclear bombers stood off the Japanese military base in Hawaii as they made their first strike against military and civilian targets in Tokyo. A naval submarine and three guided missiles sailed near Russia’s new naval base on the Pacific coast, as the Soviet Union stood on the threshold of a nuclear arms race.When President Truman announced the use of nuclear weapons on April 14, 1950, the United States was more than halfway to the goal it had long sought: the destruction of the Soviet Union.ADVERTISEMENTFive days later, the American public was shocked by the first nuclear detonation in history — on the Bikini Atoll.The Bikini Atoll was a research and development station for two atomic-powered research submarines, the USS Tennessee (SSBN 774) and the USS Greeneville (SSBN 771). The ships were designed to test different methods of nuclear propulsion, including the use of nuclear reactors.The Tennessee was the first of two nuclear-powered attack submarines built at the time, but its nuclear propulsion system was not in use at the time of the U.S. attack on Japan.Two days later, on April 18, at the height of the atomic weapons debate in Washington, President Truman addressed the nation at the White House. The most immediate issue dominating his remarks was the upcoming test of nuclear weapons by the Bikini Atoll.“We must recognize,” he said, “the very real possibility of an accident in which the explosion	0
Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said. Bahraini officials deny these accounts. Demonstrators reported hearing  "explosions" and protesters reported seeing "a heavy machine gun and a number of men carrying military shields and wearing military fatigues." The protest was the third major demonstration in Bahrain in two weeks of mostly peaceful marches. The first two were called after the January killing of journalist Jamal al-Din al-Hilali at his home in Tewfik, a city south of Manama.Police in Thailand have arrested five protesters for their roles in the death of a protester in a raid of anti-government protests in Bangkok on Saturday. Authorities said the protesters, three men and two women, were part of an "unlawful assembly" and charged them with murder. According to the Bangkok Post, the men were charged on Wednesday night on the suspicion they were plotting to kill the protester, Jatupat Rangsiklang. The protesters were arrested after the alleged plot turned out to be a hoax and they were found to have had no idea that anyone was planning to kill the protester. The men face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. It is believed the protester died on March 4 after being hit with a bottle in a scuffle with police.Two people were killed in an explosion and two people were wounded in an attack Tuesday at the protest camp of Egypt's ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in Cairo, doctors reported. Witnesses said Morsi supporters set fire to themselves in the protest camp around 4pm in protest against Morsi's ouster. The protesters threw incendiary devices, reportedly Molotov cocktails, at police forces. In a statement, police called the attack “a cowardly attempt to ignite widespread chaos and destruction.” The injured are reportedly among the 400 people who had gathered at the camp in the Giza neighborhood of the Egyptian capital.Three Palestinians died and five other were injured when a suspected terrorist attack targeted one of three Israeli-occupied buildings in Jerusalem, Israel's police said Monday. The attack, which happened Wednesday at the entrance to the Jewish University, was the deadliest in Jerusalem since the 2002 bombing of a Jerusalem bus in which 16 were killed. Israeli soldiers opened fire on suspected Palestinian assailants after they burst into the building and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the guards, who responded with	0
An architect of the Obama administration's "reset" policy with Russia says he will step down as the American ambassador to the country later this month. Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia since January 2012, announced Tuesday he'll leave the  job this month. McFaul has been the subject of controversy on the Hill, including his past work with a firm that helped design the controversial Keystone oil pipeline. In a statement on his departure, he said his departure would be permanent."I will stay until Russia is a global partner capable of addressing urgent global challenges, such as the crisis in Syria," McFaul said. "These challenges, as in any bilateral relationship, need to be addressed with a shared commitment that both sides are committed to working together with a common agenda.”I have often disagreed with Mike McFaul and have criticized his stance on Russia. The American journalist and author (and former co-director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars) Eliot Cohen is now working at the State Department, and was one of my favorite diplomats to read for his thoughtful perspective on Russian politics. I just finished Cohen’s book on the history of Soviet-American relations and he has written several pieces about Russia that help us understand our relationship with the country so much better. I hope readers of this piece will give it a listen.Former Russian ambassador to the U.S. Michael McFaul has announced that he is leaving Moscow at the end of this month to return to the United States. It remains to be seen whether McFaul will be replaced by an envoy to Russia who can be as critical of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.While he is departing the Moscow embassy, McFaul will become the first ambassador to Russia to resign his post before his term ends. The diplomat has been a critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and has criticized the Russian leader’s annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels who oppose pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. McFaul has previously called for sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.McFaul has served as U.S. ambassador to Russia since January 2012. He has been particularly critical of the Ukrainian government in Kiev, which he says refused to acknowledge the fact that Russia’s role in propping up the war in the east was instrumental in driving it into a civil war. McFaul has also blamed Russian interference – which he says is still an ongoing problem	0
Police in Raleigh, North Carolina, arrested 19 people at a rancorous school board meeting Tuesday afternoon where protesters accused the Wake County School Board of adopting a plan that will resegregate the school system. The Wake County School School Board voted in March to stop the decade-long practice of socio-economic school assignment and assign students to their neighborhood schools. The system plans to transition into the new practice in the next 15 months. Currently 85 percent of the system's 143,000 students attend a school within five miles of their home, said system spokesman Michael Evans. Another 12 to 13 percent attend magnet schools and the remaining 3 percent are assigned based on their income level and growth issues. Wake County is a booming school system with unprecedented growth that often requires the students to attend different schools, Evans said. The discontent among opponents, which included the Wake County superintendent who recently resigned as well as the state schools superintendent, has been mounting and also resulted in arrests at a school board meeting in June. Tuesday's meeting agenda did not address the issue, but it was raised by speakers during public comment, Evans said. "This board cannot and will not permit these distractions to divert our attention away from our priority, and that is of increased achievement for all students," school board chairman Ron Margiotta has said. The Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP, was one of the first arrested before he entered the school board building. He led a crowd chanting "What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now," as they descended on the school board building. Before the meeting Barber also spoke at a protest rally that drew about 1,000 people to the state capital. "This is not a game, Mr. Margiotta," Barber said. "You have in your hands the future of 140,000 young people ... you know educationally, legally and morally your policy changes are wrong." Another minister, David Forbes, also spoke at the rally, saying, "'Neighborhood schools' is a trick word to re-segregate a city that worked hard to bring about a progressive new possibility." Barber and two others were arrested before the meeting for trespassing. Police said they arrested 16 others during the board meeting for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Evans said the protesters locked arms and started singing during the public comment section.	1
Hundreds of people in Louisiana have been evacuated as widespread flooding threatens lives and homes. Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon after thunderstorms drenched the state with as much as a foot of rain this week. Eunice, a town in southwest Louisiana, has had 12.25 inches of rain since Tuesday, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service said. Jonathan Brazzell said seven parishes -- Acadia, Avoyelles, Concordia, East Carroll, Evangeline, Livingston and St. Landry -- have had widespread flooding since the storms began. There were no initial reports of injuries. "The Mermentau River is well above flood stage and expected to go to major flood stage," he said. St. Landry Parish spokeswoman Megan Vizena said 30% of the area was underwater. Authorities in Franklin, near the Gulf of Mexico, evacuated 118 people after 7 inches of rain washed over some roads and bridges, the weather service said on its website. In Acadia Parish, rescuers saved close to 80 people from rising water, including 20 at an oil well. "We will have more evacuations tonight," Maxine Trahan, a spokeswoman with the Acadia Parish Sheriff's Office said. "There were so many roads that were closed there were not enough signs (to warn residents). An iReporter near St. Francisville, north of Baton Rouge, shot video of the rushing water of a creek under a bridge. "I've personally never seen Bayou Sara this high, in this spot, in this short of a time span due to rain," said Bonnie Marquette, who is a film location scout. The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish. A third tornado, in Iberville Parish, was confirmed as well. More rain was forecast for the weekend, the service said. Watch encores of CNN's "The Coming Storms" at 8 and 11 p.m. ET Saturday CNN's Sean Morris and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.	1
What's with this wacky weather? It's so cold in Florida that farmers joke the oranges are squeezing themselves to stay warm. But Alaska is so warm that a ski resort's been forced to close. Add to this curious mix,  who's on track to claim the world's greatest number of climate change-related deaths during the year.The year is already over, so let's give ourselves to the most relevant question on everyone's mind: Who are the top 10 climate change-related deaths?We tried to keep an unbiased eye on sources and methods. We checked the date of the deaths with the source and made sure that the death wasn't due to another person's health. There were some cases where we couldn't be absolutely sure that the death was due to climate change, so we left the death blank.It should be emphasized that we decided against assigning a score to each case so as to not confuse our readers.These are the 10 most climate change-related deaths:Number 10. Eric Garner, New YorkEric Garner died in this manner in 2012. He was killed by a police officer for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. He was choked and tased and eventually died after a 13-hour ordeal. Eric Garner was just 28 years old.Number 9. Rene Bouvier, FloridaRene Bouvier was in a Florida hospital in 2004 when he died in this manner. He was struck on the head while exercising in the hot, humid weather by an 18-wheeler.Number 7. Michael E. Brown, MissouriMichael Brown was killed for allegedly fleeing police and was on the police motorcycle in Ferguson, Missouri.Number 6. Kailan J. Ling, CaliforniaIn 2010, Kailan Ling was killed this way by a truck.Number 5. Walter M. Lewis, GeorgiaWalter Lewis was killed in this manner for allegedly not obeying a Georgia sheriff's order to remove the snow from a driveway.Number 4. Charles L.

Tipsters are coming forward with additional information regarding actress Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning death, after authorities announced two months ago they were reopening the case, a Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday. "After the presser, we got a number of calls, and those calls were intriguing, and we're chasing those down now," said spokesman Steve Whitmore. Meanwhile, investigators have yet to re-interview a key witness -- Dennis Davern, the captain of yacht owned by Wood and her then-husband, actor Robert Wagner. Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had. Whitmore declined to reveal whether detectives plan to talk with Davern, saying he would "not get into the specifics" of the investigation. Investigators haven't re-interviewed Wagner either. Authorities have no plans to question the actor at this time, but "who knows where things may go from here tomorrow," Whitmore said. "The investigation is not closed. It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case," the sheriff's spokesman said. "There are leads we're following up on and have to close them out before we say anything definitive. Sure, there is possible new information that could come out that really changes everything." In November, homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had additional information about the actress' drowning, the sheriff's department said. "This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case," Lt. John Corina said at the time. Corina declined to comment directly on statements made by Davern to some media outlets. When asked if the captain could face charges for possibly lying to authorities during the 1981 investigation, Corina responded: "That, I can't say. We'll probably end up talking to the captain sooner or later, and we'll assess what he has to say then and now." Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect. Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater.	1
Forget the macho world of the standard shoot-'em up video game. Rather than relying on blood, gore and mayhem, a number of game developers are tapping into their inner emotions, inviting gamers along for adventures of the psyche.  One of the most popular is The Psychoplayer, which comes from the mind of British filmmaker Chris Carter (The Matrix trilogy), the son of a psychiatrist and a former psychiatric nurse. The Psychoplayer plays on the idea of a mental game, where the player is pitted against the computerized and virtual world, using his or her own subconscious as an opponent within the computer generated battle. Using a simple interface, the player is given a choice of two simple options at the beginning of each battle, with more complex options later on. The difficulty of the game is based on the player's own mental skills, with only a limited amount of levels and only three skills to unlock: relaxation, confidence and confidence. It has also been lauded for being an antidote to games like "sim-warfare," which is based on the idea that players can only fight with a weapon if they have the necessary "skill set" to do so. The three skills are further divided into three types: physical strength, mental strength and social and emotional strength.The games are designed by a team of game developers who have created several other games to varying levels of success. Many have a very deep emotional core to the games, using the game's own mechanics or gameplay mechanics and the player's own experience to create a psychological game which has a significant emotional core.Games and psychotherapyThe Psychoplayer is not the first psychological game. Some of the earliest games were created by Dr. Edgar Allan Poe and his team of psychologists. Though, he never actually made a game, his game P.L. Travers has been cited as the prototype for the Psychoplayer. In P.L. Travers, the player has a list of personality tests to take and the ability to pass each one by answering it correctly. Though the player would be forced to guess, the personality test was so difficult that some of them could not complete the game by answering only the easy questions correctly. In the Psychoplayer, the player's answers are revealed by a series of images rather than a quiz.In other games, the underlying logic of the game mechanics can be considered the "psycho" of the game.

The jury in the Jodi Arias trial has one decision left to make: Should she live or die? After months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the Phoenix courtroom, jurors began  reviewing the evidence Monday afternoon in a second, one-hour, closed-door meeting."As I left the courtroom today, I was reminded of something the late actor and comedian Mike Farrell told me when I was 19, 'Jurors don't always get to vote,' he said."Jurors will start answering a few questions on the state's proposed death sentence Monday night with the jury left with just three days left to decide whether Arias, 22, should live or die.A former high school student, Arias was arrested in 2009 for strangling her boyfriend, Travis Alexander. She later pleaded guilty to killing Arizmendi Ortiz, the woman she thought was the love of her life, according to The Associated Press.She went on to admit to killing two other women, however. She confessed to killing Kainoa Fontenot, a woman she met while working at a fast food restaurant in December 2009, and then killing her before setting her body on fire.She confessed to stabbing and strangling Maria Hernandez, a former Arizona State University student, and then stabbing and strangling her boyfriend after he returned home from a party.She confessed that she murdered them in a pact that led to a plan of confession."I'm just being honest with you," she told police during her interrogation in February 2010.Jury begins final day of Arias trialAt 9:40 p.m. Monday night as the courtroom was slowly filling with friends and family of Arias, a sheriff's lieutenant walked in and took the first question of the day."You've asked for an instruction that the state intended to kill Arias and the state cannot justify it. Is that correct?"The question was sent by the jury forewoman, who said she had not been able to get to the answer yet.The forewoman is the seventh juror to ask the question. The juror's name and her age was not released because the state would have to give it to the defense.The lead attorney for the defense, Tom O'Halleran, did not give his own response, but he did	0
Martin Brodeur was unstrapping his goaltending pads after another victory, about to be rushed to a TV interview, when a reporter on deadline made a request. Could he answer just one quick question? "Yes, I'm   ready," Brodeur said, and asked: "How come?"And, of course, he said it. For a week.SIXTHE CHICKEN LIEDALY: It seems that the problem in hockey is not   in stopping the puck. It's about getting the puck in   front of the nets.BEEBE: What?DALY: It's so rare these days, and it doesn't happen   very often, to intercept the puck in front of the net.  It's mostly the defensemen who are doing it. They're   sending the puck out far and wide, when the net minders   should be getting the puck to the goaltender.You're right, I was thinking the wrong thing. It's not   the defensemen who're the problem, it's the coaches.They're too rigid. The ones I've talked with here,   I haven't talked to others, aren't as rigid. For   instance, maybe they think it's not the coaches'   responsibility to do this, but as soon as their   players get a bit of a break, or even if they do   their job, the opposing team will find a way to get   infront of the net and force the defenseman to make   a run.But we don't need to get in front of the net and   force our players.   In practice here with us, the coaches have a rule:   they don't use any goalie interference. And it   doesn't matter how well the team plays. You can't   get in front of the net. You can't force a   defenseman. That's how it's supposed to be, in   practice. The goalies don't have to do it, but they   do it anyway. They	0
It's hard not to notice Aziz N'Diaye. Standing at seven feet tall, the starting center for the University of Washington's basketball team is a dominant force in American college basketball. His towering height and physical power, coupled with  his incredible athleticism, make him a difficult matchup for just about everyone. Whether N'Diaye is facing a big man, on the perimeter or playing one-on-one against some of the best ball handlers in the world, he's doing it all with ease. It's not all on the court, however: N'Diaye also has an affinity for philanthropy that extends beyond the local basketball court.As a sophomore at Seattle, N'Diaye decided to give back to his hometown by building a gym. The effort has been lauded by the Seattle Post-Intelligentsia:N'Diaye put his own money down to build this gym—the first $10,000 of which he gave to help pay for it. He wanted the project to be a means to help his community but not just for the basketball team. He wanted this gym to help kids who needed motivation and a place to build confidence. Now it's home to the University of Washington basketball program, the state college basketball league, and Seattle's youth basketball leagues.As N'Diaye mentioned in an interview on the UW Radio Network, the gym really has become an American "summer camp for kids." The school's basketball team is the recipient of this generosity, and the school's director of basketball operations has stated that this facility has played an integral role in helping the team prepare for the upcoming season. Although it has been referred to as an example of N'Diaye's charitable efforts, the facility has also provided an important venue for N'Diaye to play basketball for the community. When the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and N'Diaye and his teammates were left with a lot of empty seats during their first season in Seattle, the building was turned into a place for N'Diaye and his family to watch the Sonics play.#  **The Bigger Picture**While N'Diaye's efforts at building a community-minded facility for Seattle students is an admirable attempt to give back to the city of Seattle, we have to consider his charitable endeavors in context: The Seattle SuperSonics had a large amount of money invested into a new arena and it was	0
Almost ten years ago to the day, the world watched aghast as scenes of carnage unfolded across the countries of the Indian Ocean. The 2004 tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters in living memory and the donor response -- a huge outpouring of governmental and private support -- a heartening riposte to what was a hugely traumatizing event. It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon. Widespread disaster The tsunami, which hit communities as far afield as Thailand, Indonesia, Somalia and Madagascar, was sparked by a massive, 9.1 magnitude earthquake which struck off the western coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The immediate impact was devastation. A staggering five million people needed humanitarian assistance in the first few days following the incident. The hardest-hit countries -- Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand -- were among the poorest, and the disaster only compounded the developmental and societal issues those nations were already facing. Unprecedented donations Oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the "largest-ever privately funded response," with private donations making up 40% of all money raised -- an impressive $5.4 billion, which came close to matching government donations of $6.4 billion. A further $2 billion of disaster relief funding came in the form of loans and grants. Oxfam itself raised $294m for the tsunami relief effort, with over 90% of its funds coming from private donors. Jane Cocking, Oxfam's Humanitarian Director told CNN it was largely the "absolutely horrific" scale of the tragedy that brought out peoples' generosity. "People automatically empathized, they came out of the blue and just wanted to help." "All the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there -- it was a natural disaster (as opposed to a man-made humanitarian crisis), it was enormous, completely unexpected," she said. Multinational assistance Oxfam sent aid to seven of the worst-affected countries and continued to provide assistance well after the initial relief effort. The scale and effectiveness of the relief operation meant many of the countries were able to return to some semblance of normality a few short months after the disaster had such a widespread impact.	1

After another marathon session of questioning about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records, the Florida jury that could decide Casey Anthony's fate started rounding into shape Friday. By day's end, eight men  had been chosen to serve on the eight-person jury.All of the jurors lived in the vicinity of the Anthony family's home, which is where the trial began. Most have known the family for years. Some have sat in on the trial each day. About four weeks ago, the jury began hearing evidence from three weeks of testimony.The jury has heard from three women who worked at the house as maintenance workers, a maid who sometimes worked at the home and testified about cleaning the Anthony's kitchen and the floor in the master bedroom, and the Anthony's daughter ages 5 and 8, who testified about Casey's alleged attempts to seduce and then sexually assault her mother.The jurors have also heard testimony about the many times the woman who was testifying about Casey Anthony's alleged sexual advances said those alleged advances began at the time the boy's parents were arguing, not the time of the alleged child abuse. The woman testified Casey Anthony would look at the boy's penis during the family arguments, but that he would never actually touch his father in any way.A fifth juror, James Burch, came into the courtroom wearing a T-shirt that said: "Lying to me is against the law."Burch had been convicted of theft by deception in 1988. He was not a juror in the Anthony case because none of the other jurors knew him. Burch, who was convicted and incarcerated, said that the criminal law doesn't define sexual assault.On Friday, Burch told the jury how he had been sexually assaulted by someone who had given him drugs and told him he thought he was dead. Burch testified he had been "tortured", and that his attacker told him if he told anyone, "I would get in trouble." Burch testified the attacker also said "the only way I can get out of here is to tell them truth."The jury is scheduled to begin deliberating Monday.A sixth juror has come forward, saying he was a security guard at a mall when he saw a man masturbating. The man was a suspect in a rape case.One juror, a school bus driver, spoke from the heart. He said the case was incredibly	0
Ever wanted your own dinosaur? A rare Diplodocus longus perhaps? Answers to the name "Misty?" Well, here's your chance to add some prehistoric chic to your urban warehouse conversion. Forget feature wall, think feature urchin -- this is a "chic urchin."The Mistys have been on the market for a few years now, so you can tell they were popular. That's why you need to pre-order right now.I've been in a very similar situation when ordering a custom made dinosaur for a school-aged kid. We took the time to photograph it in detail with all the details to show everyone what he wanted. We had to show the pictures to the school in advance so they could understand the needs. As you can see, it's a very nice dinosaur.We put the final touches on a nice, functional display and put the name on the box, and we even printed the lettering, but it is still up to the customer to take the time to choose and build their very own dinosaur.Why not use the Dinosaur Builders, Inc. website to create your own Diplodocus longus for your home garage?"Chic urchin" can be good or bad news in terms of how you want to display it. It's often viewed as "not a real" dinosaur...not at all like an actual one. But, the way it's built, it's just one of those perfect "dinos." And, it's a terrific example of how one dino can take on an entire house!I ordered this gorgeous "Dinosaur Builders" package, a Diplodocus longus package, to be installed at my house. I was thinking of keeping the display on the wall but to make it a little more attractive by bringing it down on the floor and covering it with a tablecloth. I will also be putting on the name in the front and the rest of the dino is up in the back but will be covered by glass if the right room was found. I would like to get a picture of the display, but I have a few questions.1. Are the letters made in the shape of the actual dinosaur itself to give it a "real look?"2. Do we need to use the name lettering, even though it is decorative?3. Can it be installed	0
The fourteenth suspicious fire in a month's time hit a small community near Philadelphia before dawn Sunday. A huge fire spread through more than a dozen homes Sunday outside Philadelphia, authorities said. The seven-alarm fire in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, damaged more than a dozen homes and caused nearly $2 million in damage, according to city spokeswoman Kristin Geiger. No residents were injured, she said. It took 150 firefighters three hours to bring the blaze under control, and one firefighter broke his ankle, CNN affiliate WPVI reported.  Watch a town fearful of what's next » Authorities in the city announced a state of emergency on Sunday. In a statement, Coatesville City Manager Harry Walker said the declaration would allow him to "promulgate whatever special rules and regulations necessary to protect" citizens. It would also let him request assistance from other municipalities and "enter into contracts, employ temporary personnel, rent equipment, purchase supplies without regard to the normal procedures and formalities prescribed by law," Walker wrote. Authorities have been imploring residents to remove anything flammable from outside their homes -- including porch furniture and trash. Standing outside the latest blaze early Sunday, resident Janet Jackson said it had broken out just behind her house. "I woke up and everything was in flames," she said, adding, "It's really scary. ... I mean we're all afraid to even be in our houses right now." Francis Dorsheimer said he had just arrived home when his family told him they needed to leave right away because a neighbor's house was on fire. He ran outside and saw flames "shooting off the roof." "Must have been like 15-foot flames or higher," he said. "It was just unbelievable. All the smoke in the air -- you could hardly breathe."  Watch the flames eat away at homes » Beverly Rivera watched firefighters put out the blaze at the home that she had recently moved out of. She still had possessions inside. "Whoever's doing this, this is just absolutely ludicrous," she said. Referring to suggestions that the fires may be the result of gang activity, Rivera said, "If it's a gang, please stop, and find something else to do. Because this is, this is terrible. This is absolutely unreal." "I never thought Coatesville would be on the map for something like this," she added. "It's just awful. Just awful."	1
Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village. Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health. It is where Hu Xiaoping, a husband and father and a  high official in China's communist party, also lives. His sister, Lin Bao, is also there. As the only daughter of a senior leader in the party, she is in a position of influence. Her father would have expected her to marry a party official. Her family, however, is struggling.

(Gary Landes for USA TODAY)Michael Jackson was the pride of Gary, Indiana, growing up, and on Friday, his hometown paid tribute to the late entertainer with a memorial and celebration in his honor. A group pays tribute to Michael Jackson by performing some of ÂThrillerÂ as Michael's mother, Debbie Rowe, poses with her two sons. (Gary Landes for USA TODAY)For 20 years, Michael Jackson was the pride of Gary, Indiana, growing up — but on Friday, his hometown paid tribute to him in a very different way.A group of more than 100 people turned up at an afternoon ceremony at First Christian Church of Gary with a series of performances that included choreographed dance numbers from Jacksonâs music.The musical numbers were choreographed by the Gary Dance Company, the same company that worked with Jackson when he appeared at town's Celebration of Music in 2006 to honor the star of the movie “Thriller.” One of the artists featured in the shows was Gary native Stephanie Knepper-Fisher, who was featured in Jackson's music documentary.The city is also paying tribute to Jackson, who died Tuesday from an overdose of an unknown drug. He was 30.“It’s crazy to me,” said Debbie Rowe-Jackson, standing by Michael’s casket in the church’s choir loft. “I can’t believe it was 20 years ago (when Michael got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame) and here he is.”Another signee in the church is Stephanie Knepper-Fisher, Jacksonâs dance partner who was featured in the Michael Jackson documentary film. Knepper-Fisher, 50, was an actress and dancer who starred in “Thriller” and had a guest stint on “Dancing With the Stars,” where she competed during the series’ final season.The celebration in Gary	0
It was billed as a bright new beginning. But in the end Manchester United's opening day fixture of the EPL season bore all the hallmarks of its recent troubled past as Swansea City upset Louis Van Gaal's side to win 2-1 at Old Trafford Saturday. Goals from Ki Sung Yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson either side of a spectacular Wayne Rooney overhead kick ensured the Swans were full value for the three points. Apart from a Rooney free-kick that cracked the post midway through the second half, United rarely threatened or looked like a side capable of getting its league campaign off to a winning start. "It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview. "We didn't reach the level we can play at. That is disappointing because we have done it much better and when you cannot do it in your first home match that is disappointing, especially for the fans." The feelgood factor had seemed to have returned to United since Van Gaal's appointment earlier in the summer. A busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over Liverpool, Roma, Valencia and Real Madrid. But Saturday's performance had more in common with last year's disastrous campaign under David Moyes which saw the Red Devils finish seventh, their lowest placing in Premier League history. "We were very nervous in first half, made the wrong choices and that is a pity. In the second half we never played as a team, therefore I'm responsible," Van Gaal continued. "We had more chances than Swansea but that shall say nothing about the result. It is the goals that count. "I thought we would win (when the scores were tied at 1-1 in the second half) but because we are not playing as a team in the second half we made the wrong decisions going forward." Van Gaal intimated later in an interview with MUTV that there would be further signings arriving at Old Trafford before the transfer window slams shut at the end of August. Judging by this performance, the prospective new arrivals can't arrive soon enough. United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed. There were competitive debuts to new $48 million midfield signing Ander Herrera and 20-year-old center half Tyler Blackett.	1
India's cricket tour of Australia lurched to new lows on Friday, which proved to be unlucky January 13. The visitors slumped to a disappointing 161 all out in Perth and then saw David Warner smash the fourth fastest century in Test history as Australia reached 149-0 at stumps on day one. Down 2-0 in the four-match series, the second-ranked Indians went into the third encounter with doubts about the pitch at the WACA after ground staff were filmed on Thursday night drinking beer and walking on the playing surface in bare feet. Curator Cameron Sutherland defended his employees on national radio. They traditionally have pre-match drinks under the scoreboard, but this time followed Sutherland out to the middle for his final check. Tendulkar falls short again as Aussies take 2-0 lead "We were working on it ... up until the toss of the coin we can do anything we want to the wicket," he told ABC Grandstand, revealing that Cricket Australia and WACA chief executive Graeme Wood had questioned him about the situation. "We were there for an hour. So, the thing that Cricket Australia and certainly the WACA have done is got all the facts and said, 'That's a legitimate reason for you being out there, it's not as though you were just sitting on the wicket drinking beer for two hours.' " The Perth pitch had been described as a "Green Monster" by local media earlier this week, and India's formidable batting line-up performed -- once again this series -- with a timidity far below their stature. Pattinson inspires Australian win in Melbourne Ben Hilfenhaus claimed four wickets and fellow fast bowler Peter Siddle took three, while 21-year-old Mitchell Starc celebrated his third Test call-up -- and first of this series -- with figures of 2-39. Ryan Harris snared just one scalp in his first outing since November, but it was a key one as cricket's record run scorer Sachin Tendulkar was trapped leg before wicket for 15 to leave the 38-year-old "Little Master" still seeking his record 100th international century. Virat Kohli top-scored with 44, adding 68 for the fifth wicket with VVS Laxman (31) before both fell to Siddle. If India's batsmen found it hard against the four-man pace attack, the bowlers received a fearful pummeling from Warner.	1
The bodies of 14 men shot dead -- and with some signs of torture -- were found in an ersatz Nazi headquarters in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez on Monday, police and prosecutors said.The men were being held behind bars at a women's shelter run by Catholic charity Mercy Ministries on suspicion that they died of torture and execution."It was not a building where anyone was executed, but it resembled a Gestapo headquarters," said Jaime Rodriguez, whose city is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) south of Juarez, the main city in the nation's most dangerous region.A man thought to have been tortured and killed by the cartel A man is believed by authorities to have been killed by the Juarez cartel.Officials said the bodies were found in a makeshift warehouse where the local branch of Mexico's violent Sinaloa drug cartel had taken over an office complex run by the Juarez police.A lawyer for one of the victims, Miguel Angel Larios Gonzalez, said his client had been in Juarez since August on the orders of the cartel."The suspect they are looking for has been detained in Juarez and there are questions about his execution or torture," said Gerardo Espinoza, the Juarez representative for the Mexican justice department.Mr Larios Gonzalez and his family were at the police headquarters on Monday. When he got there, they saw his wife crying in tears because the police officers had come for him."When I saw her crying I said I'm not going to leave here, I stay here, I'll do everything to help them find whoever killed my husband because it was my dream that they would find him alive," said his wife, Rosario Hernada.In Ciudad Juarez, the Juarez city government said about 60 police officers had quit and the police headquarters had begun to be searched.The bodies found on MondayThe bodies were found in an ersatz Nazi headquartersThe bodies of 14 men, all shot around the same time, were found with bullet wounds to the head, hands and shoulders. They were all shot by what police described as a high-powered assault rifle, at least five with bullets to the head."This is the worst massacre I have seen in my career," said the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Benito Juarez.	0
Caster Semenya, the athlete at the center of a gender row, has appeared in a photo glamour shoot in her native South Africa. The front cover of You magazine has Semenya as the main feature. The 18-year-old is awaiting the results of a gender verification test ordered by the IAAF, the governing body for athletics, following her triumph in the women's 800m at world championships in Berlin. Her muscular build and deep voice, coupled with a stunning improvement in performance to win the global title, had led to questions about her gender. It emerged shortly before the 800m final in Berlin last month that the IAAF were conducting tests, sparking a controversy that shows no sign of abating. Semenya appears in a four-page feature in South Africa's You magazine, occupying the front cover in a tight black dress and necklace, with the headline ' Wow, look at Caster now.' She told the magazine: "I am who I am and I am proud of myself. I'd like to dress up more often and wear dresses but I never get the chance." Posing in other outfits including black leather trousers and sequined top and a stylish dress, Semenya told the magazine that her mother always buys her clothes, adding "now I know I look like this I'd like to do it more often." The IAAF have confirmed that the results of the complex gender tests would be known in the next two weeks, but would only be released after consultation with Semenya. She has received overwhelming support in South Africa with president Jacob Zuma and other politicians joining the debate. But earlier this week, national track coach Wilfred Daniels resigned, claiming he should have told Semenya in July that she was to undergo tests to determine her sex. Semenya won gold in the fastest time of the year for women's 800m of one minute 55.45 seconds, finishing several meters clear of her rivals. It remains unclear if she will be stripped of her medal if the gender verification process casts doubt over her sexuality.	1
When the average person contemplates the issues surrounding landfills, it's doubtful they give much consideration to the tons of food that fill them. Food biodegrades so where is the problem? The problem, environmentalists say, is just that. When food rots, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is 20 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide (CO2). Rotting food in a landfill in Canterbury, England. The developed world chucks out a lot of food. Such is the volume that according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), if just 5 percent of Americans' food scraps were recovered it would represent one day's worth of food for 4 million people. The U.N. World Food Programme offers another way of looking at it: It says the total surplus of the U.S. alone could satisfy "every empty stomach" in Africa (France's leftovers could feed the Democratic Republic of Congo; and Italy's could feed Ethiopia's undernourished). Proportionately, the UK and Japan have traditionally been among the worst offenders worldwide in recent years when it comes to food waste, discarding between 30 and 40 percent of their food produce annually. The figures for how much the U.S. throws out, however, vary considerably depending on whom you ask. According to the USDA, just over a quarter of the country's food -- about 25.9 million tons -- gets thrown in the garbage can every year. But according to a study conducted by the University of Arizona, that figure could be as high as 50 percent, as the University claims that the country's supermarkets, restaurants and convenience stores alone throw out 27 million tons between them every year (representing $30 billion of wasted food). Either way, it still costs the U.S. around $1 billion every year just to dispose of all its food waste, according to the EPA. But moral and economic issues aside, it is the environmental concerns around food waste that is driving the push for reform on how to treat the problem of leftovers. Methane, the gas food waste produces, traps 23 times as much heat in the atmosphere as the same amount of CO2, the EPA says. And landfills are the place you will find most of it -- they account for 34 percent of all methane emissions in the U.S.	1
On Sunday, November 2, it will again be the end of Daylight Saving Time. Many of us will be muttering to ourselves as we wander around resetting all of our various clocks -- on the thermostat, clock radio and stove, among other places. Sure, you'll get an extra hour of sleep by turning back the clock by an hour in the fall. But if you have a regular day job, you'll be commuting home in the dark instead of in daylight come the following day. Why do we do this every fall? And why do we dial forward the clock by an hour every spring? Daylight Saving Time has been around for a good part of 20th century, but there's no really good reason why we should continue with the status quo. The U.S. government started moving into and out of "Daylight Saving Time" during World War I to copy the Germans, who said they were doing it to save fuel. When the war ended, the U.S. government wisely repealed the law since it proved unpopular. During WWII, it came back -- again with the notion that it would somehow conserve resources. After the second war, the U.S. converted factories from making bombs to making cars and consumer products. The GIs came home. But Daylight Saving Time just stuck around. Numerous polls show that people want to stay in Daylight Saving Time year round, or at least just stick with either Standard or Daylight time and stop switching clocks around. Two states, Arizona and Hawaii, already keep their clocks the same all year long. We may have reached a tipping point to end the clock-changing madness. First, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a report in 2008 that examined the impact of extended Daylight Saving Time. A four-week extension would save approximately 0.5% of electricity per day for the country. Put in perspective, it's enough energy to power 100,000 households for a year. The second strong case for staying in Daylight Saving Time year round is that we can save lives. A recent study shows the switching of clocks in the spring causes a 25% jump in heart attacks in the few days following the switch, confirming earlier research that point out the shift in time can disrupt the quality of sleep and biological rhythms. Taking away an hour of sleep and jolting you awake in the predawn darkness is simply bad for your health, especially if you are elderly or have a heart condition, researchers noted.	1
The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said. Attorney Razan Zaytouni sent CNN a list Sunday naming more than 500  people he said have been held by the regime since protests began. He said he learned of the list from a pro-government activist whose cell phone he and his family had been using to stay in touch with him since the demonstrations began in March.It is possible that Bashar al-Assad will go through with a military parade in Damascus, a senior security official told CNN. The official, who's in contact with Assad’s inner circle, said the regime was moving toward a parade in late June, after the summer holiday season. The official wouldn't say when the parade would take place. Damascus does not typically have parades in summer, but it holds more than usual during the holiday celebrationsAs a new year is approaching, the United States may ask Russia to take “more effective measures” to get rid of a number of Syrian chemical weapons, the Pentagon chief of staff said on Sunday. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was responding to a question about the US warning that Damascus needed to rid its chemical arsenal before the US-Russian-brokered agreement on September 16 that would see Syria and Syria’s ally, Israel, turn over their chemical weapons. The US-Russia agreement says Syria has to destroy its entire chemical arsenal within a 12-month timeframe. Syria has already agreed on destroying its most advanced chemical program, but it is still seeking to find time to destroy other chemical weapons with limited international participation.The United States is ready to help Syrian rebel fighters secure their lines of communication in an effort to ensure that opposition fighters, from whom they expect to receive significant support from the international community, won't be cut off in the event of a US attack, the White House told CNN on Saturday. "We have been very clear to the opposition, no matter what happens in Syria, the United States is going to support them to the best of our ability to get rid of those who would harm or exploit them militarily," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at the White House. "And we're ready to do that. But we are not there about getting rid of Assad or making sure that Assad's political future is secure."The United States said Monday that it has suspended the	0
Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton. He has no connection to her paid staff. And he is not collecting a paycheck from a cadre of groups anticipating a Clinton presidential run in 2016. All of this icky stuff might be why Mr. Magruder is doing his best to keep Hillary in the mix at the National Religious Broadcasters convention this week in Washington, D.C. He is one of the many religious leaders who have a soft spot for the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee.“I’m supporting Hillary because she’s a fighter for the issues that really concern me,” Magruder told Open Salon. To a certain extent, he is right in that sense. Though it will take another three years of Hillary on the national stage to fulfill the progressive and socialist promises of her presidential campaign, her time as secretary of state has been spent pursuing a number of progressive policies. That includes helping to rebuild Iraq after spending a fortune in the Middle East and working to improve the quality of life for people left behind by the war. But on more concrete issues, such as Wall Street and the role of the Democratic presidential nominee, Magruder is more critical of the presidential nominee than of Secretary Clinton herself.After all, the majority of those supporting the Democratic nominee in 2016 are not “Bernie Bros” (as the mainstream media likes to describe them) or are socialists. They are people for whom the party nominee has nothing but disdain. Magruder doesn’t support Bernie Sanders (he even once said in 2010 that he wasn’t his favorite politician) or socialist parties, but he does support Elizabeth Warren, who is the most prominent Democrat in Congress with the most liberal voting record in the last fifteen years. Elizabeth Warren’s Senate record includes supporting the minimum wage, the Employee Free Choice Act (which would have allowed for employees to form unions), and her own Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She is the first and only Senate Democrat to sign the Employee Free Choice Act into law.While Magruder opposes the war in Iraq (though he did vote for the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force in 2002), he is much more critical of the war on drugs (and other social issues) than he is of foreign policy. The drug war has also been a very significant issue in Magruder’s life. Not only was he the father of nine children,	0
Former President George W. Bush has a number of accomplishments under his belt: Texas governor, U.S. president, and now, a New York Times best-selling author. But even though Bush's book about his  former life in Texas doesn't cover his presidency to any meaningful degree, it's still incredibly relevant.Bush's book is, in effect, a memoir about his political rise as well as his life as a private citizen. It has a number of autobiographical elements, including his father's and his wife's death and the collapse of his marriage, family problems, alcoholism, and death.But there's also plenty about his experience as a governor, a vice president, and president. And most importantly, he writes candidly about racial attitudes and his views on race relations post-9/11.To give a fair assessment of Bush's book, we need to get behind the scenes. And we need to keep in mind that this is a collection of events, not a single narrative.So let's delve into the nitty-gritty of Bush's book.Bush the GovernorThere's no doubt that George W. Bush has been very busy. As Texas governor from 1989-1993 and from 2001-2009, Bush led the state through many of the issues listed above.But there's also the fact that the nation's longest-serving president, in a very short period of time, found himself on the cusp of a historic rise in the national spotlight. And with this came a dramatic fall as well.We're not going to do a whole lot of deep dives into the specific events in Bush's life, but we will discuss a few of the major ones.Starting with his relationship with Texas' First Lady Laura Bush. The former president and his wife's friendship grew out of their love for one another. Laura is the mother of the couple's two children, Neil and Jeb.Laura is also the daughter of former president George H. W. Bush and Barbara—also Bush's wife, though not a public figure, but a good friend of Barbara's.And it was Barbara Bush who chose Laura to be president of the University of Texas.Laura has also been a close friend of the Bush family. And the couple is quite the pair. It seems like Bush had a natural affinity for the woman who chose him, and she reciprocated	0
For the fifth time this year, a U.S. Air Force nuclear weapons unit failed an inspection, this time because of failure to document its handling of nuclear missiles and other critical issues, Air Force officials said. In an Air Force file photo, an airman inspects a missile part at a training site. A "nuclear surety inspection" and "unit compliance inspection" was conducted this month on the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming by an Air Force inspector general. There was no risk to the unit's Minuteman III nuclear missiles, Air Force officials said. The unit has 90 days to correct the problems and pass another inspection. In the wake of recent problems, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top Air Force officials have indicated a zero tolerance for failing inspections, but no punishments are expected in this case, officials said. The inspection report found the maintenance unit failed to document tests conducted on missiles correctly, including tests on safety devices. The inspector general told the unit the failures indicated either a "lack of competence" or "disregard for procedures," according to a source who has seen the report. Additionally, failures included having some personnel on duty without proper medical clearance and failure to inspect radiation detectors. Other units that failed inspections this year included two bomb wings and two missile units.	1
The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said. Attorney Razan Zaytouni sent CNN a list Sunday naming more than 500 people she said have been arrested since the start of the unrest a couple of weeks ago. Roughly half of those people have since been released, the list shows. CNN could not independently confirm details of the report. Last week the Syrian Arab News Agency said that a wave of arrests came as government security forces were searching for members of an "armed group" that killed "a number of citizen and security forces." SANA reported that an unidentified official said snipers from the group fired at citizens and security forces from rooftops. This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators. Protesters in Syria are upset at what they see as the nation's heavy-handed rule. Opponents of the government allege massive human rights abuses and are calling for political and economic reform. They also want the release of all political prisoners and an end to emergency law. The emergency law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. In effect since 1963, it also bars detainees who have not been charged from filing court complaints and from having a lawyer present during interrogations. Zaytouni said she is part of a group of lawyers that has volunteered to help defend political prisoners. "But our role is superficial. There is no judicial system in Syria and the security apparatus arrests people and send them to courts directly," she said. Amnesty International estimated late last month that at least 93 people were believed to have been arrested by Syrian security forces between March 8 and March 23 and held in unknown locations. The real number arrests is likely to be "considerably higher," the rights group said, adding that the detained include students, intellectuals, journalists and activists. Zaytouni spoke the same day the family of an imprisoned activist said he was freed. Mohammad al-Abdallah told CNN his brother was released Sunday after more than five years in prison. Omar al-Abdallah, 26, was accused of "taking actions and making threat(ening) statements against the state in Syria," his brother said. Their father remains a political prisoner, he added.	1
Since the Democrats chose to host their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a state that has not been hospitable to unions, organized labor is going to have a rally to focus attention on its key issues in Philadelphia on August 11. The rally is meant to send a message to the Democratic leadership, as well as to Republicans, that many workers feel as if they don't have a voice in the two-party system. As AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka said to members, the rally will "give us an opportunity to connect the faces of ordinary Americans to the basic issues affecting working people in our country while providing an important liftoff to our Labor 2012 political program for the fall." The rally is indicative of a larger tension that has plagued the Democratic coalition for several decades. Since the 1960s, organized labor, once the pillar of the Democratic Party, has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility. Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for 2nd straight day Union leaders frequently complain that they have second-class status in the party compared with other groups such as environmentalists or suburban voters. During the battle over public employee unions in Wisconsin, most national Democrats were noticeably absent from the debate. Before the Wisconsin gubernatorial election that followed the recall, President Obama was willing to tweet his support for Gov. Scott Walker's opponent, Tom Barrett, but unwilling to actually visit. This fissure has high costs for the Democrats and for liberalism more generally. Organized labor has been integral to the organizational strength of liberalism throughout the 20th century, as the most reliable and powerful force to get out the vote in elections and to help build congressional coalitions behind progressive legislation. The alliance, which formed when the AFL helped President Woodrow Wilson during the early stages of World War I, flourished during the New Deal. Democrats won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working- and middle-class Americans find economic security. The Wagner Act (1935) cemented this marriage as the federal government legitimated the right of workers to organize in unions. Labor leaders like Sidney Hillman from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, who helped found the CIO, established the first political action committee to help FDR win re-election in 1944. During World War II, most of the major unions were a key part of the homeland effort, assisting the administration as it moved to convert factories to wartime production.	1
Iraqi lawmakers elected a Sunni politician as Parliament speaker Tuesday, finally taking a step to form a new government after two weeks of deadlock while the country faces a powerful Islamist militant insurgency. Lawmakers elected Salim al-Jabouri, the head of a Sunni coalition, as speaker of Iraq's Council of Representatives. The Iraqi Constitution mandates that the job go to a Sunni Muslim. The body also elected two deputy speakers. MAPS: Understanding the Iraq crisis Al-Jabouri announced that lawmakers are accepting nominations for president, saying that there are three days to nominate and then the body will reconvene. The president must be Kurdish and the prime minister a Shiite. The body had convened July 1 to elect a new speaker, but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for July 8. That session was delayed, and more arguing erupted. Under the constitution, the Parliament has 75 days from when it convenes to pick a prime minister. While lawmakers are under pressure to act quickly, the political body has had trouble moving swiftly in the past. The last time Parliament met to pick a prime minister, it took nearly 10 months. The quagmire persists even as fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS -- a Sunni-dominated al Qaeda splinter group -- have overtaken large swaths of Iraq and Syria. The militants want to establish an Islamic state spanning both countries. President Barack Obama has authorized 300 military advisers in Iraq, 210 of which are there now. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement of congratulation to Iraq for electing a speaker and deputy speakers. "The election of a speaker is the first step in the critical process of forming a new government that can take into account the rights, aspirations, and legitimate concerns of all Iraq's communities," the statement read. "We urge Iraq's leaders to follow this achievement with rapid formation of a new government pursuant to Iraq's constitutional timelines." The statement urged the international community to support Iraq's "democrative political process," adding that the "stakes of Ira's future" depend on its leaders to work together and stand against ISIS. Obama has ordered an assessment of Iraqi security forces, which was given Monday to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Pentagon spokesman said.	1
Senate Democrats are wrapping up their tenure in the majority by reigniting debate on some of the former President's most controversial policies with a long-delayed report on the use of torture - "enhanced interrogation techniques" - by Â© CIA interrogators after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The four-page report, prepared by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), is expected to focus on the Bush administration's pre-war intelligence assessment and interrogation efforts in late 2001 and early 2002, as well as torture and the detention scandal that has brought criminal charges against former Bush administration officials.While the report is sure to touch on controversial issues such as CIA black sites, enhanced interrogation, or what the CIA knew about the terrorist plots that eventually led to the September 11 attacks, the document has little chance of becoming law.Nevertheless, the Intelligence Committee report represents a milestone and serves as a warning to Senate Democrats that they need to be more transparent than they have been with the White House over the way they have conducted business."At the end of the day, these are things that really matter," said Feinstein, who is set to offer her recommendations this month to the Senate Armed Services Committee, which she chairs. "We've got a responsibility to set an example around the world" for how "we deal with national security matters."She emphasized that the committee will not discuss specifics of the CIA's interrogations in an attempt to avoid the controversy that flared when former CIA Director George Tenet's CIA Inspector General report on the interrogation program - which did not include detailed descriptions of CIA interrogations - was published last year.Nonetheless, Feinstein noted Thursday that committee chair is committed to providing greater access and oversight than some other Senate committees.In addition, Feinstein noted that the Intelligence Committee, unlike its predecessors in the Senate, has a legal requirement to report any new evidence of abuses, including "torture" that may have been conducted during the Bush administration.The Intelligence Committee's chair said she believes the report will be "dispassionate, objective, [and] factual."Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy is expected to review the report as part of his review of the criminal charges involving the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, announced on June 15. Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, will review the report in a parallel review process for the Senate Armed Services Committee and	0
She's got nerves of steel, golf talent beyond her tender years, and a precocious flair for eye-catching fashion: 11-year-old Lucy Li, the youngest qualifier in U.S. Women's Open history, looked entirely iced-over as the sun poured into the stands at Bethpage Black on Tuesday. (Her attire was pure blue; the rest, white -- except for her hair.) And when she had her first serve return by the Spaniard Anna Tatishvili and reached into her bag for a tiny yellow ball, it was time to do so. The crowd at Bethpage Black roared as Li delivered a double-faulted birdie putt on the par-3 fifth. Her caddie, a young man named Noah O'Brien, who played on the U.S. team at the U.S. Women's Open last weekend in East Lake City, Mo., said Li will learn to play golf "from the ground up" after that.In the end, though, it's not hard to be a professional golfer on tour. The players who turn pro at 18 have to get a college degree. The others have to have been pretty good at golf from some point in their life, and then show up a professional event, much less qualify for a tournament. Li, after all, has a history of having fun, a history of playing well in the amateur ranks and then making the big leap to the professional ranks. So it was strange for this young prodigy to be there and to be playing golf -- and doing it with a caddie who, as it turned out, didn't know the difference between a short putt and a chip shot.Li, whose mom died of lung cancer when she was a baby, doesn't have the greatest life. She was born at age 6, and her parents and older brother were too poor to have a proper education. Her mother, a seamstress and a mother of five, wasn't a fan of golf. So Li played the game herself, and after leaving it behind, she discovered "Golf Channel." The young prodigy learned the sport as a means to pay the bills. There was one year, however, when she was playing in tournaments while carrying a large bag of cash, which her mom told her was ridiculous. "You have to learn how to do what you're doing," she said.By her third year on	0
White supremacists, Islamic clerics, a controversial Kansas pastor and a U.S. talk show host are on a list of 22 people banned from Britain for "stirring up hatred," the British government said Tuesday. Jacqui Smith said she did not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views. Britain's Home Office said it decided to exclude the 22 in the last several months. The decision follows measures introduced by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith last year against people "who have engaged in spreading hate," the Home Office said. The Home Office named only 16 of those on the list; it said it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on why the Home Office would not publicly identify six of the 22. One of the most recognized names on the list may be U.S. radio talk show host Michael Savage, who is listed under his real name, Michael Alan Wiener. The conservative's daily show can be heard nationwide in the United States. Savage is on the list for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence." Savage lashed out at Smith on his Web site, calling her a "witch" and asking how she knew of his show when it isn't syndicated in England. He also questioned why six names on the list weren't released and why North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez didn't make the list. In an audio clip on his Web site, Savage said he had seven attorneys working on a defamation lawsuit against Smith and encouraged his listeners to call off any travel plans to England and boycott all British products. "She has painted a target on my back, linking me with people who are in prison for killing people," he said. "How could they put Michael Savage in the same league as mass murderers when I have never avowed violence?" Outspoken Kansas Rev. Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for "engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred." Phelps and his followers at Westboro Baptist Church oppose homosexuality. They picket the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq, saying their deaths are God's way of punishing the United States for supporting homosexuals. They have expressed similar views about the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The church's slogan is "God Hates Fags."	1
China's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval, according to new regulations announced by authorities on Thursday, which took immediate effect. The State Internet Information Office released a 10-point document detailing new rules for instant messaging (IM) service providers and users. It is the latest move in an official campaign to "clean up the online environment and rein in rumormongers," according to Chinese media. Although the rules apply to all IM service providers, they are widely seen as targeting WeChat, the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text, videos, photos and audio recording with multiple users at once. Public accounts on any mobile IM platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners. There are 5.8 million public accounts in China on subscription-based mobile apps, including celebrities, businesses and other organizations, according to state media Xinhua. The rules also stipulate that, while the accounts of professional news providers are allowed to post about politics, all other accounts must obtain prior approval from authorities to post -- or repost -- political news. Dominating the digital "This is just the latest set of rules to remind everyone who's in charge and provide yet another legal and verbal framework for silencing troublesome voices," says Jeremy Goldkorn, commentator on Chinese Internet and founder of Danwei.com. A similar set of regulations was imposed on users of Sina Weibo two years ago, the micro-blogging platform commonly referred to as China's Twitter. Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities. Lately, "rumor mongers" have become the target of the official online clean-up. In April, Qin Zhihui, who goes by "Qinhuohuo" online, was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading false information on Weibo. "After the takedown of the Big Vs (verified accounts with huge follower numbers) on Weibo last year, I more or less gave up posting anything to the Chinese Internet," says Goldkorn. "The government has successfully brought Weibo under control and has become the dominant voice there. I have no doubt that they will succeed with WeChat," he adds. Another user of a popular WeChat account on current affairs said that the new regulation "will definitely impact what I'm going to post in the future.	1
Comic actor Harvey Korman has died at 81, according to the UCLA Medical Center. Harvey Korman's death comes after complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Korman died at the center four months after suffering complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. "It was a miracle in itself that he survived the incident at all. Everyone in the hospital referred to him as 'miracle man' because of his strong will and ability to bounce right back after several major operations," said Korman's daughter, Kate Korman. "Tragically, after such a hard-fought battle, he passed away." Korman was a regular on "The Carol Burnett Show" from 1967 through 1978, for which he won Emmy awards in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1974. He also won a Golden Globe for his work on the series. The lanky Korman also appeared in Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" (as the sneering Hedley Lamarr), "High Anxiety" and "History of the World, Part 1." He starred in his own short-lived situation comedy, "The Harvey Korman Show," in 1978, in which he portrayed Harvey Kavanaugh opposite Christine Lahti, who played his wife, Maggie. He made dozens of appearances in other television shows and movies during his lengthy show-business career, including providing voices for several animated productions. Among those was The Great Gazoo, a helmeted space man who appeared in some episodes of "The Flintstones." Angie Horejsi, an assistant to Burnett, told The Associated Press that Burnett was devastated by Korman's death: "She loved Harvey very much," Horejsi said. The AP also reported that Brooks described Korman as a "dazzling" comic talent. "You could get rock-solid comedy out of him. He could lift the material. He always made it real, always made it work, always believed in characters he was doing," he said, according to AP. Korman was born in Chicago, Illinois. His first marriage, to Donna Ehlert in 1960, ended in divorce in 1974. He married Deborah Fritze in 1982. Both marriages produced two children. Korman landed some sketch work on "The Red Skelton Show" in 1961, followed by a four-year stint on "The Danny Kaye Show," which led to his joining Carol Burnett in 1967.	1
A forensic psychologist endorsed a proposal to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. more freedom away from his mental hospital, giving his opinion that Hinckley "would not pose a significant risk." Paul Montalbano's testimony in federal court on Tuesday came on the 11th day of proceedings to determine whether Hinckley can spend more time visiting his mother in Virginia and might eventually be released as a permanent outpatient. Montalbano, an expert on risk assessments, is one of a number of mental health professionals who has been following Hinckley's case for more than a decade. He was called by Hinckley's legal team to support the view Hinckley is ready for more privileges and would not be a danger to himself or others. Hinckley, 56, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Thomas Delahanty. Hinckley currently is allowed to spend 10 days a month at the Williamsburg, Virginia, home of his 86-year-old widowed mother. Montalbano said he supports St. Elizabeths Hospital's plan to first give Hinckley two visits of 17 days and then six stays of 24 days. After that St. Elizabeths wants the authority to decide whether Hinckley can be placed on "convalescent leave" to live in Williamsburg. Government prosecutors oppose the plan. During court proceedings, mental health professionals have presented varied views about the man who tried to kill Ronald Reagan in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. Hinckley's experts say his most serious mental diseases are in remission, that he's made progress and can make even more if he's allowed more time outside his mental hospital. Witnesses for the government say Hinckley is isolated and has made no friends during his trips to Virginia. They say he can be deceptive and has problematic relationships with women, most of whom he has met at St. Elizabeths. Hinckley has not testified. His voice has occasionally been heard by court spectators when he enters the court and says "good morning" to his lawyers and the judge. He sits quietly listening to experts. The hearing resumes on Wednesday and could conclude this week. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman is expected to take some time to review all the evidence before issuing a ruling on the hospital's proposal.	1
For all their buzz and value, location-based social networks haven't really gone mainstream yet. Only 7 percent of Americans are aware of location-based social networks, according to data from Edison Research. Part of the explanation for this is that the majority of mobile users aren't using smartphones. And as a result, just 10 percent of those surveyed use mobile location services at least once a week, according to the Mobile Marketing Association's latest Mobile Consumer Briefing survey. For smartphone users, like those of the iPhone (a popular device among early adopters), that number jumps all the way up to 63 percent. Still, even with smartphones predicted to overtake feature phones sometime next year, there may still be adoption hurdles for location-based social networks. Here's a look at why location-based services haven't yet hit critical mass and what those platforms are doing about it. Privacy concerns remain an issue Kristine van Dillen, director of industry initiatives and partnerships at the Mobile Marketing Association, said location-based services aren't growing as quickly as they should be. One reason for the lag is concern over privacy and who has access to users' data. Sites like PleaseRobMe.com, which humorously bring awareness to location-based privacy issues, may have scared some social media users from opting in. Furthermore, the use of geo-location data for commercial purposes has also raised concerns, prompting the Congressional subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection to hold hearings on the issue. Concerns about loopholes in Foursquare that give others the ability to announce your check-inshave also been raised. "There's still a perceived risk in accessing location data," van Dillen said. Location-based service providers are addressing these concerns by giving consumers more control. Most current iterations of the popular location-based networks allow users to opt-out of location tagging and notifying users when their location is being shared. Consumer education is also key. Users need to know how their location data will be used, and feel comfortable that the companies that have access to it will behave responsibly, according to van Dillen. She said consumers will become more comfortable sharing information with their friends and trusted applications. Brands will view these services as less risky, and more mainstream, and new types of location-based services will come to the forefront. Where is the value?	1
Joselyn Martinez was 9 when her father was shot and killed outside his New York City restaurant in 1986. Nearly three decades later, she may finally see justice for his death. And she has herself to thank. Her family's tragedy started on November 22 1986, when her father, Jose Martinez, had an altercation with a few customers at a restaurant he owned with his wife. The fight moved outside the restaurant and got physical, according to the New York Police Department. One of the customers, then 16-year-old Justo Santos, allegedly produced a firearm and shot Martinez in the chest. When Joselyn awoke the next morning, her father was dead. "Reading the paper for him in Spanish," Joselyn said of her favorite memories of her father. "He would tell me to read the paper for him, and I would sit with him and read the paper in Spanish." Case closed After the killing, the NYPD received information that Santos had run to the Dominican Republic and was incarcerated there for murder, and the case was closed in 1988,  NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. A year after Santos was imprisoned, he was released from the Dominican Republic prison. But the New York case remained closed. "They should not have closed the case," NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday. "(It) should have been looked at to see if there was additional information as to whether or not he was out of jail." Martinez grew up and eventually went to school to study law and Latin American studies, a path she later left for a career as a singer and actress, she says. Law lessons In one of her law classes, she learned that there were no statutes of limitation on homicides. She decided to take another look at her father's case. About 10 years after the shooting, she said, she went to the NYPD's 34th precinct. But she was told that the case was closed and the suspect had fled. "You let it go, but not really," she said. "Because November comes around, when is the anniversary of his death, and I just get upset." In 2006, inspired by a book, Martinez wrote down a list of things that were bothering her. "I said well, I put that in there," she said about never finding her father's killer.	1
The Obamacare website might still be slow, but the politics and context of Obamacare are shifting rapidly. On Thursday, to deal with some of the grousing about canceled insurance plans, President Obama announced an administrative fix to allow people to keep _____ if they liked it.As we wrote in August, this would allow individuals to keep their health insurance under Obamacare — the law will still not be able to keep the health insurance plans for people with pre-existing conditions.The problem is that if Obama’s announcement is true, it’ll get people in the middle of trouble in the next few days. Because if people like their insurance, there aren’t any plans left for them to keep their insurance.What’s more, because some people have been paying the taxes they’ve been paying for a decade, they might not be able to afford the insurance they wanted to keep, and that might increase premiums for those who don’t even get coverage as the exchanges go into effect on Oct. 1.So, Obama’s fix is both a boon and a problem. It’s a boon for Obama because he’ll still get the votes that are a prerequisite to keeping the law. But it’s a problem for him and for the country because people who like their insurance (or who thought they liked it) will be locked out of it in a big way. What was once insurance is now insurance that nobody likes.(Update: We now know that the announcement is a bust, but a separate analysis shows that the number of exchanges with premiums still above the "benchmark" is still very small, and that those with premiums less than the benchmark are few.)So is there a way to keep people who like their plans from going broke?Well, yes and no. No, because the plan — the one that we’ve all been waiting for since the mid-August deadline — is to have Obamacare pay for the cost of all these exchanges — and they’ll probably run out of money before that happens.But there could be a way to do it.And that’s to keep people who like their plans from being forced to drop or substantially reduce their coverage.The problem with Obamacare’s exchanges is that the law’s requirement of everyone, regardless of their pre-existing health condition	0
Mitt Romney has taken many people by surprise by announcing that his vice presidential running mate will be Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan. The decision excites many conservatives who have been calling on Romney to go big. They believe Ryan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a leading spokesman for the GOPÂs economic planÂ will help the two-term Republican win over the conservative base that has frustrated Romney during the 2012 election season.As I have noted previously, Ryan is one of the most conservative members of the House, where he has become more and more influential as a result of his role as an advocate in the House for a plan by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI). Ryan is a man of immense character, and has led the charge for conservative ideals. As an advocate of fiscal restraint, he has made it clear that the plan he proposes would slash spending in order to reduce spending and debt. And as a conservative on social issues, he has fought every effort by the GOP to move the U.S. from its socially conservative roots by allowing for gays to serve in the military openly with the exception of a handful of special cases. The plan Ryan is pushing would also bar abortions by requiring hospitals to report cases and to have protocols in place to prevent abortions when a woman is in danger of dying.As a result, Ryan is not just a conservative with conservative ideas, but also a man who is an effective debater who knows how to present conservative ideas in a way that speaks to a wide audience. In 2010, Ryan was the only House member who could talk with Tea Party activists and win them over and motivate them to come and support the GOP during the midterm elections. Aides on both sides of the aisle were amazed at how Ryan could bring people into his tent, and at the level of engagement that he reached. He was able to get the House to pass a bill that Republicans could only be afraid of taking back by a narrow vote. The final vote in the House was 257 for the bill and 193 against it. Ryan went on to say that had he not had such a strong debate performance, the House would have lost the vote.Ryan is a conservative who has been willing to take tough stands on issues. He has been willing to take the lead on issues that conservative members had not taken on. He has been willing to try to move the country in a conservative direction and has been willing to make the	0
President Obama, visiting CIA headquarters Monday, defended his decision to release Bush-era memos on interrogation tactics, saying the country will ultimately be stronger as a result. President Obama met with CIA workers and Director Leon Panetta, left, Â Â and, from left, CIA General Counsel John Rizzo, President Bush’s former national security adviser, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Susan Rice, and Deputy Director George Little, who oversees the National Clandestine ServicePresident Obama has made an important decision with regard to the country’s use of interrogation tactics, one he has said he made based upon his understanding of the intelligence that led to the war on terror. He also said it was his decision alone and that he did not make it because of a campaign against him by Republicans.The White House was criticized by Republicans, but then rebuked by Democratic Sens. Russ Feingold and Rand Paul of Kentucky for not being forthcoming with information related to the matter. Feingold’s office said he had asked for classified information from “a few months ago” and was turned down. Paul, an early supporter of the Iraq War, said he had gotten an email asking for information on the operation of the CIA when he served in the Senate and had asked the agency when information could be declassified. The White House said the information turned over about the detention of suspected terrorists after 9/11 amounted to “a few paragraphs” in an “outdated” report about the interrogation of those same suspects. But a new report by the Senate Intelligence Committee found that at least some of the information provided by those reports was outdated—a finding that would leave him open to criticism from the Intelligence Committee.Feingold’s press secretary, Ben Schwerin, said the senator’s concern “has nothing to do with the release of CIA documents on interrogation” but that the information was “inadvertently provided,” making it a “personal and private matter.”Feingold’s press secretary said the senator “is committed to disclosure and expects to receive information from agencies that he feels is important to the public.” Schwerin said Feingold planned to release the CIA information at a later time when he feels it is “a fair disclosure.”The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the Justice Department to determine	0
President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.

The meeting comes a day after the White House announced $4 million in funding for community foundations for a "new generation of neighborhood development."President Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, in the Blue Room at the White House. | GettyPresident Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, in the Blue Room at the White House. | GettyPresident Obama meets Monday with his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, in the Blue Room at the White House. | GettyOn Nov. 26, 2001, Osama bin Laden and his senior lieutenants were watching a television news broadcast about the World Trade Center's twin towers.A decade later, after years of planning and surveillance, the Pakistani government, fearful of its leader's whereabouts, took control of bin Laden at his mansion in Abbottabad.With the nation's capital in lockdown, President Obama has sought to reassure Americans and to project confidence as the week unfolds. The president has said his national security team is working to "put a man in Pakistan to try to capture or kill Osama bin Laden," and has ordered the deployment of U.S. combat troops to Afghanistan.Yet there is little evidence that those tough actions will be matched by action in response from the White House and Congress.On Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, described the president's goals as "simple," though there is little clarity to how he plans to achieve them."The president would not send a combat team to Afghanistan unless he thought that was a responsible use of our military force," Carney said at a news briefing. "But that said the president is always willing to consider additional steps by Congress. But ultimately, the decision is in the hands of Congress.""The president has ordered a vigorous review by the White House and the Pentagon of the steps, and ultimately, we will determine what we are able to do and what not," he added.In other words	0
In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say. But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left  destitute and, if you want to call it that, abandoned.They are the poorest people in the Western Hemisphere. They live in a nation more than four times their size, with a history and culture so different from those of the Haitians who were originally settled there in the 18th century that they were referred to as Amerindians in 1791. The people of Haiti today are known as Tainos, to distinguish them from the Afro-Haitians of African lineage.When you see them in the streets, with the children running between them, the way they move, you’re drawn into their lives. At the age of 16, when I first arrived, the Tainos were already facing the threat of starvation, with a life expectancy of 41 years.I was drawn into the life of Pauline and her family, which was, and still is, filled with love, generosity and caring. She and her husband Jean Marc were always doing something, no matter how ordinary, that would ensure their child arrived in good health.“Here, they don’t call them tainos, they call us Tainos. That’s what we call us.’’Pauline was a mother with a mission. When she was 16, she married at the age of 18. Since then, no man has ever touched, much less had sex with, her. She’s been faithful to each husband.“My children, I don’t have a single son or daughter with anybody else. They have no way to see us or to know how I feel about them. My parents are right when they say that we are a family.”She makes sure to take good care of her children, even when they have nothing. Her younger daughter is just 12, but she has already taken the place of her mother. Pauline is a strong woman, in charge at all times. She’s a grandmother in what is otherwise a grandmotherless family. She says she’s happy with her life.But in these times of darkness, with a new crop of young men without work	0

A man shot and killed four children and two adults Wednesday at a Houston-area home belonging to relatives of his estranged wife, authorities said. A seventh person, a 15-year-old girl, was critically wounded in the shooting near Spring, Texas, and taken to a local hospital. Ron Lee Haskell was arrested after a three-hour standoff that followed a short chase with sheriff's deputies. Haskell, 34, is being held on charges of capital murder, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said. Killed were Stephen Stay, 39; Katie Stay, 33; two boys, ages 13 and 4; and two girls, ages 9 and 7, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Police said Haskell entered the home demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, who was not there. The house belonged to relatives of Haskell's spouse, and Haskell might have been an uncle by marriage to at least some of the children, but his relationship to everyone in the home wasn't immediately clear, Hickman said. "I've not personally in 40 years seen a tragedy in one family that's this horrific," he told reporters Thursday morning. Officials: Suspect was prepared to take more lives Haskell, apparently posing as a parcel delivery driver late Wednesday afternoon, entered the home of one of his estranged wife's relatives while only the children were there, Hickman said. Wearing a purple "Fed-Ex-looking shirt," the suspect "gathered up the children" and waited for the two adults to arrive, he said. Haskell was not the slain children's father, as police had mistakenly asserted earlier, Hickman said. Haskell used to drive for a service that had a contract with FedEx, but not since January, FedEx spokeswoman Erin Truxal said. Investigators didn't immediately know what led to the shooting; Hickman described it as a "domestic situation." Authorities believe the suspect was prepared to take the lives of other relatives who lived nearby. As the gunman left, one of the victims called police and notified "us of the location that she believed that he may go from there," Hickman said. "Grandparents were also targets of him," Harris County Sheriff's Sgt. Thomas Gilliland said. "Fortunately, they were brought out of the house before that could happen, (or) we would have had more tragedy." Hours-long standoff	1
A yellow smiley-face badge, smeared with blood, has become the trademark for "Watchmen," the most critically revered of all comic books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big  screen.The movie's director, Zack Snyder, had been reluctant to release the film in its unaltered form, and a decade is now in the making, so it came as a surprise when Warner Brothers, the company that owns the rights, agreed to let him release his vision in a new, cut-down form. But the decision has been a relief for many fans of the original text.A quick look at the credits or the film's production schedule reveals that Snyder has been reluctant to release the film in its unaltered form, and a decade is now in the making, so it came as a surprise when Warner Brothers, the company that owns the rights, agreed to let him release his vision in a new, cut-down form. But the decision has been a relief for many fans of the original text.Somehow, though, there's always a chance a director could come along and change it. That was the case with the director of "Punch-Drunk Love," Nicolas Winding Refn.Though I hadn't seen the film, I was invited to an early screening for his debut feature, "The Neon Bible," and I immediately became a fan. The movie stars a strong ensemble cast, and the story is loosely based on the life of the novelist William S. Burroughs. (Refn's film uses the graphic novel's illustrations as its visual foundation.) As a matter of fact, Refn claims to have adapted the story over the course of his career."I've never seen the actual novel," Refn told me through an interpreter in a recent conversation in Los Angeles. "I know I've read it in various forms for as long as I can remember, and I've been a fan of the novel, with all its contradictions and ironies, for as long as I can remember." Refn was born in 1982 on the Norwegian island of Bergen, as Refn Tondeløv, with his mother and father being a doctor and a lawyer, respectively. Refn's father also used to be a journalist, while his mother also worked in a newspaper, and his parents met and fell in love later on when he	0
A suspected serial bank robber wanted in incidents in three East Coast states has been arrested in Medford, New York, the FBI said Tuesday. Agents and New York police arrested Luis Alomar, 37, around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, the agency said in a statement. It didn't provide details of where he was arrested in the Long Island community or how he was located. The FBI had sought the public's help Monday in finding Alomar, who is suspected of robbing 20 banks in New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Alomar allegedly flashed a gun at tellers in some of the robberies, sometimes threatening to shoot them if they said anything, the FBI said.	1
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin hit the campaign trail Friday, delivering the keynote address at a Washington  fundraiser for an anti-abortion group supporting socially conservative women running for office in the upcoming midterm elections. "All across this country, women are standing up and speaking out for common sense solutions," Palin said at the Susan B. Anthony List Celebration of Life breakfast. They are forming a "new conservative feminist movement" that will help make "government work again for us," she said. The Susan B. Anthony List describes itself on its website as part of the "nerve center of the pro-life movement and political process." In 2008, the group founded "Team Sarah," a coalition of women supporting Palin's vice presidential bid. During her speech, Palin ripped abortion rights opponents in the Democratic Party who "promised to hold firm" during the health care debate, but ultimately backed "the most pro-abortion president who ever occupied the White House." "We won't forget," she promised. "Elections have consequences." Palin mentioned, among other things, her daughter Bristol's decision not to have an abortion after becoming pregnant at age 17. "It was an embarrassing time for her," Palin told the audience. But "choosing life was the right road." Palin said national media coverage of the pregnancy "kind of made it rough" on Bristol and sent a not-too-subtle message to other young women that it's easier to choose to have an abortion. Turning to other policy disputes, Palin also slammed the Obama administration's fiscal program, declaring that "these policies coming out of D.C. right now" are putting the country on the road to "national insolvency." She praised the conservative Tea Party movement, calling it a "movement of the people" that the media has unfairly characterized as a group of violent racists. "This awakening is very, very healthy," she said. Palin's speech was part of a midterm campaign swing that is scheduled to take her to North Carolina on Friday to address a National Rifle Association meeting. In addition, she will travel South Carolina to endorse GOP state Rep. Nikki Haley for governor. The state's scandal-tarred Republican governor, Mark Sanford, is term-limited and will leave office in January. "It is a tremendous honor to receive Gov. Palin's endorsement," Haley said in a statement released Thursday. "Sarah Palin has energized the conservative movement like few others in our generation."	1
A major international environmental group has pulled out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, saying the Kimberley Process had refused "to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny." So why are so-called "conflict diamonds" so controversial? What are conflict diamonds? Conflict or "blood" diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa, according to the World Diamond council, which represents the commercial diamond trade. The United Nations defines conflict diamonds as "...diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council." They are generally in "rough" form, meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut. At the height of the civil war in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world's diamond production. Who suffers? Apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels, thousands of men, women and children in countries such as Sierra Leone are used as slaves to extract diamonds. They are often forced to use primitive, back-breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands. The collected material is then separated using hand-held sieves. What is the Kimberley Process? The Kimberley Process started when Southern African diamond-producing states met in Kimberley, South Africa, in May 2000, to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence. The result was an agreement by the United Nations, European Union, the governments of 74 countries, the World Diamond Council -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as Global Witness. They established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are "conflict-free." Each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from, how they were mined, where they were cut and polished, the parties involved, and their ultimate destination. The idea is that members of the Kimberley Process cannot trade with non-members. Is it working?	1
Robots can be many things -- knowledgeable, dexterous, strong. But can they ever be genuinely laugh-out-loud hilarious? "If you prick us in our battery pack, do we not bleed alkaline fluid?" asks Ginger the Robot, haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a real-life comedian. Truth be told, if Ginger were a human it'd be dying on stage. The cute little machine's monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt, while its expression is as vacant as a doll. Comedic timing is hard to master -- particularly when you have no emotions. Luckily for Ginger, sitting beside it is comedy sidekick -- and programmer -- Heather Knight. The living, breathing 31-year-old engineer heads a theater and robotics collective called Marilyn Monrobot. The group runs everything from a Robot Film Festival, to Cyborg Cabaret, and stand-up alongside poor old Ginger. "I fell in love with the idea that we could collaborate between the arts and robotics," explains Knight, originally from Boston and now a doctorate student at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh. "I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot, and I was like 'hey, what about a comedy routine on stage?' That way you could make jokes and get real-time feedback along the way," she says with infectious fast-talking enthusiasm. Funny business The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction -- at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been "cheating" on it. "I caught her collecting videos of other robots," says the knee-high "Nao" robot, created by French robotics company Aldebaran, and popularly used as a learning aid in universities. "I don't feel pain," says blank-faced Ginger. "But still, that does not compute. I confronted her and she claims she needs to do research with other machines to improve my response capabilities." There's only one way to win Knight back, it seems. And that's through some aptly robotic dance moves. Indeed, Ginger's charm lies in its very "robot-ness" -- which has more in common with human comedy than you might think.	1
With less than a month until Christmas, toy retail experts are predicting that Santa's sleigh won't be the only thing flying through the night sky this festive season. Both international toy store Toys 'R' Us and the UK's Toy Retailers Association have named remote control flying toys among their "top toys" for Christmas 2013 -- and that's just the beginning of the flying robot invasion. Aerial bots of all sizes -- from miniature flying fairies to full-scale surveillance aircraft -- could be appearing under Christmas trees come December 25. It's evidence that the high tech materials and components developed for complex flying robots are filtering down creatively to the new world of "civilian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles." It wasn't long ago that easily controlled multifunctional quadcopters were only seen in the hands of tech university researchers and military specialists. Now, cheap, lightweight motors and stability-providing gyroscopes are available to anyone, opening up flying robot technology to the world of toys, as well as providing new ways for shutterbugs to make home movies and shoot aerial photos. Check out the slideshow above to see some of the amazing flying robots that are available for kids and adults alike. And consider giving Rudolph a break this year by giving a gift that can make its own way down the chimney.	1
Two bodies found this week in Oklahoma are those of a murder suspect and his slain wife's missing 7-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday. The bodies have been identified as Lester ia son, 26, and his 23-year-old wife and daughter, police said.The bodies of the couple, who were killed in early December, were found Wednesday at a house about five miles from where they were last seen, about 45 miles southeast of Tulsa.Authorities said the couple's only child, 7-year-old Amber Nelson, was last seen in the couple's van in Tulsa about 12 hours before her parents were found shot to death in a home in southeastern Oklahoma.The bodies were found Wednesday along a dirt road about five miles from the home where the couple was last seen. The two bodies were discovered near a trailer where the couple lived, after a police officer who was trying to find witnesses to a burglary spotted them.Police investigators have recovered evidence implicating the two men's estranged brother in the killings.The brother, 26-year-old Anthony H. Lewis, was arrested Monday night, after his release from prison, on suspicion of first-degree murder, police said.Neighbors in the neighborhood where the bodies were found confirmed that the two had lived on the property in the past.Oklahoma City police Officer Daniel McDaniel said it was still early in the investigation and officers were still trying to confirm the identities of the bodies.Lewis was in the Tulsa County jail on Saturday afternoon, while Amber's mother, Kim Wilson, was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the leg. She is recovering, according to relatives.A state magistrate court in Tulsa ordered that Lewis be held without bail.Police haven't named a possible motive for the killings. But the murders prompted a search for Amber and Lewis.A neighbor who declined to be named said he and his wife, who have known Lewis for seven months, had been told several times that the couple had taken Amber to a hospital in the past or had been going out of town before her disappearance.The neighbor said that two days before the bodies were discovered, there was an argument between Lewis and their son, who lives about 500 yards away from the house where the bodies were found.The son, who didn't want to talk to AP, said he was aware that his father had been going to	0
North Korea defended Thursday its right to explore outer space after reports that a rocket, believed by the United States to be a long-range missile, had been positioned on its launch pad. Replicas of South and North Korean missiles are displayed at the Korea War Memorial in Seoul. North Korea recently informed a pair of U.N. agencies that it plans to launch a satellite. The launch is believed to be slated for sometime between April 4 to 8, according to Yonhap, South Korea's state-sponsored news agency. North Korea's announcement has triggered international consternation. U.S. and South Korean officials have long said the North is actually preparing to test-fire a long-range missile under the guise of a satellite launch. Pyongyang lashed out against critics on Thursday in a commentary reported in the state-run KCNA news service. "This is nothing but a groundless outcry of the political philistines ignorant of any legality of the study of space science for peaceful purposes," the commentary said. "Outer space is not a monopoly of a few specified powers but an asset common to mankind and the space development is promoted worldwide at present." Should anyone have the right to explore space? The United States has no plans to shoot down the North Korean rocket, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday in an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty, but will raise the issue with the U.N. Security Council if Pyongyang carries out a launch. "We are doing our best to dissuade the North Koreans from going forward, because it is provocative action," Clinton said. "It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718. And if they persist and go forward, we will take it up in appropriate channels." North Korea is technically capable of launching a rocket in as little as two to four days, according to Kim Taewoo, an expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, but who doubts a launch will come that soon. It would not make sense for Pyongyang to make such a move after going through official channels with its plans, Kim said. "The North could delay the launch if they experience problems with the weather, or within the leadership, but I don't see any reason why they would fire it ahead of time," Kim said. What the North Koreans would be testing may not be known until an actual launch, U.S. officials have said.	1
Sporting an all-black racing suit, Bubacarr Jallow kneels next to his bright red motorcycle to check its oil levels and make sure the nuts and bolts are tightened properly. Satisfied, he hops on his Yamaha AG100 and hits the iced-down streets of the Netherlands of the motorcycle’s first season in the World Superbike championship.It’s been an eventful year for the young Spaniard, from his home in Andalusia who took a two-year wait to make the move into the WorldSBK paddock earlier this year.After testing on the factory Ducati, in addition to being tested by the factory Ducati Test Team alongside the rest of the world’s WorldSBK teams, Jallow’s first ride was with the Repsol Honda team.A long time comingThe idea of the Spaniard doing a ride at the iconic Dutch circuit was first conceived in 2007 when he was at school studying electrical engineering.It was in the school's computer lab that Jallow played computer games, taking the initiative to do something that had never been done before, which was to enter a bike race.After years of dreaming, Jallow finally had his chance when he was at Bordeaux-based Honda’s Factory Racing Department where he spent two years training before signing with the Repsol Honda Worldbike team, as his first ride.The opportunity came at a time when his long awaited move into the world of motorcycling started to become more real.BudweiserThe journey was not easy.Jallow had to deal with an uncertain future because he had to make the move to America where he would have to give up his Spanish citizenship.“My dad was very concerned,” says Jallow, “but when I told him I was going to the States, he believed in me and gave me full support.”A lot had to be cleared up before Jallow and his family could make it to the States.“It took three months,” says the young Spaniard, who spent his first four months in a camp in Texas and then had to make his own way across the border to the US.The Spaniard’s first step was at his alma mater where he was taught English and was given the opportunity	0
Police who are investigating a major wildfire in northern Israel have detained a 14-year-old boy who admitted smoking a water pipe in the woods near his village, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The wildfire killed at least 42 people and destroyed an estimated 4,200 homes.The suspect is being held at the Magen David Adom hospital in Petah Tikva. The police have not released the name of the boy.The teenage boy admitted smoking the water pipe in the forested Yizre'el Valley near the community of Beit Suriya while others were gathering wood for the Shabbat morning ritual kiddush, a senior police official said.The boy, who is under investigation as a suspect, will be questioned again in two days, he said.The fire started on Friday after the teenager lit the burning water pipe and threw it on the fire, the official said. Neighbors saw him doing this and alerted the police.The teenager was arrested on Saturday, the official said.Magen David Adom hospital spokeswoman Rina Golebi said Sunday that the teenager's parents had been notified that a 14-year-old had been arrested in connection with the fire.The parents of the boy were "out of town today," Golebi said.The police received "a tip-off" from Israeli intelligence, and on Saturday detained the boy, whom the police believed could be involved with the incident, the official said.The police "have a number of other suspects," the official said.The fire was started on Friday by an unattended water pipe, the official said.The official could not provide any details on how the fire started - whether it was an accident - but said that the incident took place in the Yizre'el Valley, between Beit Suriya and the community of Huneit "Ama" in the Beit Suriya area.The incident comes amid a massive buildup of tension in Israel during the Passover holiday.The Israeli police detained more than 100 Palestinians after protesters threw rocks at a major Israeli checkpoint Saturday while a group of Israeli policemen was attacked in the West Bank by a Palestinian gunman on Friday night.(Inter Press Service)	0
Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant have a proposition for us: a biopic dedicated to the memory of San Francisco activist and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, who was murdered by a fellow supervisor in 1978. Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant. The subject may be a tricky sell, but the timing feels right -- a few weeks late to save Californians' same-sex marriage rights, admittedly, but the need to keep on fighting through adversity may be Milk's most important legacy. And "Milk" is a powerful movie that will stir more than a few hearts and minds. An audiotape Milk records "just in case" is screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's convenient structuring device, foregrounding the story's tragic outcome and allowing Milk to narrate his own life story. In this telling, it's a life that begins at 40 -- when he picks up Scott (James Franco), falls in love, comes out and drops out. The year is 1970, and San Francisco beckons. Their Castro Street camera store soon becomes a focal point for the booming gay community, and it's not long before Milk makes the first of several unsuccessful runs for district supervisor. Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter. The gay rights movement's most critical accomplishment, the film suggests, is how it liberated gays to be themselves. As Milk tries to explain to his heterosexual colleague Dan White (Josh Brolin), this isn't about principles, it's about people's lives -- three of his lovers had threatened suicide. One of them, Jack Lira (Diego Luna), goes through with it. The political can't get more personal than that. Ironically, the devoutly "normal" White is the one who is truly messed up. Here's another irony: To earn the recognition and validation of the voters, Milk has to shed his reborn hippie uniform and ponytail, put on a suit and get a haircut. Making the same calculation, director Gus Van Sant has axed the long takes and experimentalism that made "Elephant" and "Paranoid Park" arresting but decidedly marginal experiences and turned in his most conventional movie since "Finding Forrester." In other words, he's playing it straight this time.	1
It's the story which just refuses to go away -- and now a new FIFA "whistle-blower" has claimed bribes were offered in exchange for votes during the World Cup 2018 and 2022 bidding process. A former member of FIFA's ethics committee, Les _____, alleges he was paid $8,000 to "vote for" FIFA's bid to host the 2026 and 2022 tournaments, and that he was then asked to "vote against" the bid team, the Qatar bid:FIFA's bid committee to host the 2026 and 2022 World Cups has been accused of bribing the former members of the ethics committee to back its bid.The committee was set up to tackle corruption issues during the bidding process for both World Cups, with the intention that it should provide a neutral platform to make recommendations on how to avoid such issues in the future.Former members of the ethics committee, who were nominated by the bidding committee in 2014 to represent the interests of "all parties", who now accuse the two bid teams of bribing them to support their bids to host the two World Cups.In a letter sent to the ethics committee of FIFA, a group called "the former members" of the ethics committee, said they were "not surprised at all" about the bribery allegations."We are writing to you, on behalf of the past and present members of our ethics committee, in the belief that you as the Ethics Committee would be aware of this issue and that there would be no need to alert you to these matters. We wish to express our anger and protest against the alleged actions of our bid committee. We are also concerned that you may have information that would be appropriate to share with us about the alleged bribery in which we have been made complicit," said the letter."We are concerned about the alleged abuse of the ethics committee by our committee colleagues. We are disturbed that the ethical issues raised by the past members of our committee should play a role in deciding the future of the football world," said the letter."We are disturbed by the allegations of bribery, and we intend to keep you fully informed of the issues which might arise in connection with the World Cup in Qatar. We also have a strong moral obligation to tell our story as well.""We wish to confirm that we have never received any payment or any benefit of any kind from anyone to vote for or against the bid on the FIFA Ethics Committee	0
For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas. The financially struggling single mother of fraternal twins recently asked her 8-year-olds to write down a list of things they would like from Santa. Suffern, who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company, wanted to start budgeting for the holidays. She knew her twins, who just began third grade, were at the age where they would start asking for electronics and other expensive gifts. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: "Dear Santa ... I wanted a (remote control) car and helicopter, but I don't want that anymor. Kid at school are still picking on Amber and its not fair," he wrote. "I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy and needs your help." Suffern felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school. Reading the letter was tough for Suffern. "I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me," she said. "I can't imagine what she goes through." She had a vague idea that Amber was teased on the bus, but she didn't know the extent of the bullying. Amber, who has attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and other mental and mood disorders, never mentioned the teasing. Bully-proofing your kids Suffern explains that Amber is an emotional eater and weighs 140 pounds, nearly twice the size of her brother, Ryan. The twins returned to school three weeks ago at Rocky Mount Preparatory in North Carolina. It's the first time Ryan and Amber have been in the same classes. Ryan would come up to Suffern to tell her in private about classmates bullying Amber -- how the kids in gym class would laugh at her when she could not do the bear crawl on the floor, tease her about her weight in class or tell her that she was adopted because she is multiracial.	1
DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday. File photo shows a crane unearthing the mass grave in northern France. The bodies come from Fromelles in northern France, where thousands of British and Australian troops were killed or wounded in a single night in 1916 -- a night the Australian military still considers among the worst in its history. An exploratory dig in May of this year confirmed that there are between 250 and 300 bodies buried at the site. Enough DNA has been recovered from teeth and bones to make full-scale testing worthwhile, the British Ministry of Defence said. Pieces of uniforms including belt buckles and buttons have also been found, which will help with identification, the ministry said. "Each one of these soldiers will be laid to rest with the dignity they deserve and we owe it to them to do all we can to identify them," British Veterans Minister Kevan Jones said in a statement. The DNA testing program will be the largest undertaking to identify individuals killed in combat ever commissioned, the ministry said. The announcement comes only a week after the burial of the last British veteran of World War I still living in the United Kingdom. Harry Patch died July 25 at the age of 111, a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. So many soldiers died on the night of July 19, 1916, that many were never found, identified, or given a proper burial. Two divisions of Allied infantry had attacked a strongly fortified German position known as the Sugar Loaf. The defenders knew the British and the Australians were coming; the terrain favored the Germans. As the British and the newly arrived Australians charged into battle, the Germans opened fire. By morning, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were dead. About 5,000 others were wounded. There has been speculation for decades that the Germans recovered hundreds of bodies and put them into mass graves, not forgotten, but anonymous. Last year, preliminary digs commissioned by the Australian government located five mass graves near the site of the battle. "It's the largest military find since the end of the Second World War," said a spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. "I have been on the commission almost 11 years and it's like nothing I have ever experienced. I have never known anything to have this sort of numbers of possible remains," Peter Francis told CNN.	1
Just when cruise lines thought they might be headed for calmer waters ... At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have reported being ill on board Princess Cruises' Caribbean  cruise ship.The illnesses took a toll on all on board. At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have complained of not feeling well.More from NYPOST.COMThe sickness, which began June 7, was first reported yesterday by the company on its website, and earlier by the Tampa Bay Times. The company said all passengers and crew were taken off the ship.Princess Cruises spokeswoman Emily Green said, "On Thursday night, we did a complete health check on all of the cruise ship's guests and found some guests were not feeling well. Due to the seriousness of the situation and limited information at that time, we made the decision to remove the passengers and crew from the ship.""It is very, very concerning that the passengers are complaining of feeling sick," said Dr. David Gelfand, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Rutgers-Newark School of Medicine. The problem is that the symptoms of seasickness don't show up for a few weeks or months, said Dr. Gelfand.About a dozen crew members have been sickened with a stomach virus, and 11 passengers have reported symptoms of seasickness.On Friday, Princess Cruises posted an update on its website, saying that the illness had spread to eight passengers at the Port Canaveral cruise terminal."We have been in close contact with all affected passengers, and are providing them with the appropriate support, including medical and psychological care," Princess Cruises wrote.So far, no passengers have reported being struck by lightning; no cruise ship has been struck by lightning.The ship has now been docked in the St. Thomas port for at least five days. Princess Cruises is scheduled to leave after Memorial Day weekend.The Florida National Guard has been on the ship, which is located in the Port Canaveral cruise terminal, since May 20. The company has not reported any deaths of passengers or crew, but Capt. Jerry Ellis has said that at least one crew member has died in his 45 years of sailing.The ship has undergone upgrades to lower the humidity, which is needed to keep passengers comfortable on what is considered an "anti-microbial" cruise.Princess Cruises has taken the following actions	0
The top Senate Republican on Tuesday laid out a hard-line negotiating stance on upcoming budget battles, rejecting any tax increases and demanding "significant" reforms in exchange for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. "We're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters. Without providing specifics, McConnell said it would take "something the markets would view as significant, something the American people would view as significant, something foreign countries would view as significant" in order for him to vote to increase how much the United States can borrow. Congress must reach an agreement on the debt ceiling before the United States reaches its legal borrowing limit of $14.29 trillion. McConnell said the Treasury Department has indicated the nation would reach its debt ceiling "sometime between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July." He called for "something real, something measurable" that will begin to reduce the national debt. McConnell also made clear that he opposes generating more revenue through higher taxes to tackle the deficit and debt problems. "From my point of view, taxes are not on the table because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem," McConnell said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, suggested mandatory caps on government spending and a balanced budget amendment as possible reforms to accompany a measure raising the debt ceiling. "We're only talking about doing this if we can be assured there are guarantees in place that spending doesn't get out of control again," Cantor said of allowing more borrowing by the federal government. A few minutes after McConnell spoke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, noted that Republicans and Democrats have widely differing views on how best to strengthen the nation's fiscal situation. Reid accused Republicans -- including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, who has released a 2012 budget proposal -- of seeking to protect the wealthy and their special interests. "The only thing Republicans fought to protect were the richest of the rich," Reid said of last week's budget negotiations on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year. "It is clear once again that the two parties' priorities are significantly different," Reid said of Ryan's proposal, adding it would provide no help for the middle class.	1
In July, Iran lost one of its most acclaimed playwrights and directors when Mahmoud Ostad-Mohammad passed away in Tehran at the age of 62. Scores of relatives, friends, and theater lovers attended his funeral ceremony that was adorned with pictures of Ostad-Mohammad -- his trademark mustache and playful smile on display. Some wept while embracing copies of his famous screenplays. Among the mourners was Ostad-Mohammad's daughter, Mana, who is convinced that Western sanctions against Iran were partly to blame for his father's passing. "This was the doctor's testimony," said Mana Ostad-Mohammad. "This is based on my father's medical tests." Through five decades, some of the most famous Iranian plays were brought to life by Ostad-Mohammad. Some were Iranian classics. Others were originals.  All were stories about the loves and losses of everyday Iranians. Then in 2011, came a diagnosis of late-stage liver cancer. Surgery was not an option, but Ostad-Mohammad's oncologist prescribed the cancer drug Nexavar. According to his doctor and medical tests, the drug appeared to stop the cancer from spreading. "We were very hopeful that if he gets through this stage, he could get healthy and start living his life again," said his daughter Mana. But beginning last year -- soon after Washington and Western powers imposed additional sanctions against Iran to rein in its nuclear program -- Iranian doctors, pharmacists and patients say finding Nexavar and several other drugs that treated deadly diseases became increasingly difficult. Western powers have stepped up the pressure on Iran since 2006, when the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to impose new sanctions for Tehran's failure to suspend its nuclear program. The European Union imposed further sanctions last year. U.S. officials have long said medical goods are exempt from the measures and that Western sanctions are specifically designed to target the government, not ordinary Iranians. But Iranian officials say with the Western ban on Iranian banks doing business with much of the outside world, even medical goods that are exempt from the sanctions are often impossible to import. "We have a serious shortage of drugs due to high prices or because they're impossible to purchase," says Tehran-based pharmacist Imen Heirani. Heirani said everyday he gets as many as 30 calls a day from patients looking for hard-to-find drugs. "They're obviously tired because they've been searching for a while."	1
Agents on Wednesday will release dozens of interviews conducted during the investigation of sexual assault allegations against star professional quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The interview records were compiled by prosecutors, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, and the defense during their three-year investigation of the allegations that former team executive and friend Brett Behrendt sexually assaulted two women. The interviews will be made public as early as Thursday morning and will be available on the Web site of the public-defender's office. In addition to Mr. Roethlisberger, whose interview is expected to be the most extensive, all of the interviews will be conducted in person. Only the interview with Mr. Roethlisberger will be available through the newspaper's Web site, but all will be available to the public. The interviews include a wide range of people and issues, ranging from the relationship between Mr. Roethlisberger and his then-girlfriend, former ESPN sideline reporter Karen Farrow, to the relationship between Mr. Roethlisberger, Mr. Behrendt, then-sports psychologist and former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, to Mr. Roethlisberger's own recollection of what occurred. During his deposition, Mr. Roethlisberger said the relationships between him and Ms. Farrow and Mr. Paterno were very short-lived; Mr. Roethlisberger testified that he had relationships with both women for about two months. Mr. Roethlisberger also testified in his deposition that he was not aware the women had been assaulted. He said that he did not recall seeing one of the women until the interview, one month after she had a fight with the Penn State football team's security staff. The interviews will be the most expansive yet conducted during any court proceeding involving the Roethlisberger case. The interviews conducted during the trial were the most extensive of any cases since the early 1970s, when the Roethlisberger case involved the sexual assaults of several women on Mr. Roethlisberger's family ranch in Pennsylvania and the deaths of two of the women. Also on Wednesday, the public defender's office is expected to file motions for a new trial and to suppress Mr. Roethlisberger's statements that he was unaware of the women's claims of sexual or physical assault. Mr. Roethlisberger's trial lawyer, Joseph C. Bledsoe Jr., said Tuesday that he	0
President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart hit the road together Friday, traveling to the heart of America's Rust Belt to tout a recently approved trade deal between Washington and Seoul. Obama also used the occasion to defend his controversial 2009 bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which has shown recent signs of recovery. Obama and President Lee Myung-bak visited Orion Township, Michigan -- on the outskirts of Detroit -- to visit a General Motors assembly plant. GM, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, got federal funding to help with its reorganization. The plant, which now produces the new Chevrolet Sonic subcompact, was set to shut down during GM's bankruptcy restructuring. But the plant's subcompact expertise -- along with a joint venture with GM Korea -- saved the facility and its 1,750 jobs. The trade deal is "a win-win" for America and South Korea, Obama told a crowd of cheering workers at the plant. "We live in a global economy. ... The more goods and services we sell abroad, the more jobs we create here at home." This deal "will not take away any of your jobs," Lee declared. "This is the pledge I give you today." The two leaders also hailed the new trade deal at a White House dinner Thursday. Congress approved the agreement on Wednesday -- along with deals with Panama and Colombia -- on a bipartisan basis. Administration officials contend the South Korean deal alone with boost U.S. exports by up to $11 billion while supporting 70,000 American jobs. "We believe in American ingenuity," Obama said Friday. "Most importantly, we believe in American workers." Partly as a result of the auto bailout, Detroit "is a city where a great American industry is coming back to life," Obama added. It's time to "write the next proud chapter in the Motor City's history." The audience gave an enthusiastic reception to Lee, who wore a Detroit Tigers cap. The Tigers are currently playing for the American League pennant. While trade has dominated the headlines during Lee's visit, Washington and Seoul also share a common concern over North Korea. "We agree that North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the world," Lee said Thursday. "We will continue to work towards denuclearization in the peninsula."	1

The "Fifty Shades" series will have to handcuff a new director. Sam Taylor-Johnson, who directed "Fifty Shades of Grey," told Deadline.com that she won't be back for the sequel, "Fifty Shades Darker." "Directing 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' has been an intense and incredible journey for which I am hugely grateful," she said in a statement to the site. "While I will not be returning to direct the sequels, I wish nothing but success to whosoever takes on the exciting challenges of films two and three." 'Fifty Shades of Grey': What fans hoped for? The first film in the best-selling book series has been hugely successful, pulling in more than $550 million worldwide since it premiered in mid-February, but there have been rumbles that creative clashes were in the offing for the sequel. Author E L James has a great deal of control in how her books are presented on screen, and she made it clear that she wanted to write the screenplay for the second film, Variety reported last month. Kelly Marcel wrote the screenplay for "Fifty Shades of Grey." The story behind Mr. Grey's suits The film stars Jamie Dornan as billionaire Christian Grey -- a man of certain sexual proclivities -- and Dakota Johnson as his romantic partner, Anastasia Steele.	1
The New York Times Co. will sell The Boston Globe to sports magnate John W. Henry for $70 million, a fraction of the price it paid for the paper two decades ago. The company paid $1.1 billion for the properties. The impending sale to the owner of the Boston Red Sox is for 6.3% of the price it paid. Both The Times and The Globe reported the deal Saturday. Henry's Fenway Sports Group owns the baseball club, Fenway Park, 80% of a regional sports television network and the giant Liverpool Football Club in England. The sale includes the Telegram & Gazette newspaper of Worcester, Massachusetts. As advertising losses and new reader habits afflicted newspapers nationwide, The Times began looking to shed The Globe and even threatened to close the paper in 2009 amid disputes with unions. Henry said he would disclose details about his plans for the newspapers soon, The Globe said. "This is a thriving, dynamic region that needs a strong, sustainable Boston Globe playing an integral role in the community's long-term future," The Globe quoted Henry as saying.	1
A massive typhoon crept across central Philippines on Sunday, sending thousands of people into shelters and pouring heavy rain that heightened the risk of flooding and landslides. Typhoon Hagupit -- its name means "lash" in  Manila's Tagalog language -- threatened to deliver the region's worst storm in years, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes and leaving at least six dead.The typhoon killed at least six people, officials said, with the latest victim found at the coastal island of Leyte, in the country's northernmost region, where the typhoon struck.A woman died, the Philippine Navy said, after moving her family from her home on the island of Mindanao to a safer place in Leyte.Read MoreThe Philippines faces severe flooding The Philippines is bracing for more than two months of severe flooding, the worst in the country's history.The typhoon, now a once-in-100-year typhoon, is one of the biggest storms ever to hit the Philippines.It is expected to bring heavy rains to other parts of the country and will likely batter the capital Manila.The storm is now moving north over North Vietnam and China, with wind gusts of up to 80 miles per hour and an expected storm surge of 10 to 15 feet, according to US government forecasts.The storm's winds reached a peak of 195 miles per hour on Saturday, the weather bureau said.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is preparing for heavy rains, floods, landslides and uprooted trees, and is asking Filipinos to avoid driving at night.NDRRMC spokesman Dennis Jalili said on Monday that there has been no damage in Manila, but that more than 2 million people have been affected by the typhoon, including at least 500,000 in Leyte province, the country's main island."The typhoon is now moving north, towards Hanoi, Vietnam, and our forecast for the typhoon continues to be for maximum winds up to 195 mph (305 kph)," he added."There is no doubt that this is the strongest typhoon ever to affect the Philippines, bar none," Huan Pham, a meteorologist at the weather bureau said."The typhoon will bring heavy rains to the Philippines, particularly in eastern and northern provinces, particularly in the Leyte	0
Beyond the hedonism of tasting these wines -- and the hedonism of tasting these wines is going to be off the charts -- I think there will be two very important ideas that come out of this," says wine educator and "The Wine Bible" author Karen MacNeil as we share a bottle of Stony Hill 2012 Napa Valley Gewurztraminer over lunch. "To see if the vintners themselves believe there is some reason that these wines scored as highly as they did; and to see if the people enrolled in the event think there is a ribbon going through the wine. "Is there a commonality that causes a wine to be considered great?" MacNeil is one of the top wine authorities in the United States -- "The Wine Bible" has sold 700,000 copies since 2000 -- and we're two of a privileged few taking part in a 1,000-point wine tasting event, featuring 10 Napa Valley wines that each received a perfect 100-point score from Robert M. Parker Jr. of "The Wine Advocate." "Since Robert Parker began, there have been 369 wines in the world that have been given a perfect 100 score. "Something like 130 of these are in the U.S. Of that 130, 119 are in California and of the 119, 68 are from the Napa Valley," says MacNeil. Located 60 miles northeast of San Francisco, Napa Valley is around 30 miles long and ranges from one to five miles wide -- about one-eighth the size of Bordeaux. Despite a 6.1-magnitude earthquake on August 24 that resulted in damage ranging from a few broken glasses to structural damage to some buildings and equipment, 2014 is already looking to be another excellent and abundant vintage. September is the most exciting time to visit. Fruity pickings As wineries gear up for harvest, pickers move through sun-drenched vineyards, hand-dropping fruit to improve the quality of the final crop; equipment, already cleaned and prepared, stands idle at winery buildings, ready to process the fruit. The Napa Valley Experience -- organized by the nonprofit, 500-member Napa Valley Vintners association from September 7-10 -- is arguably the most sensational event taking place this harvest season.	1
Almost 10 hours after a United Airlines airplane ran off the runway Monday, crews finally removed the wayward plane from its landing site at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, an airport spokeswoman said. Michelle Wilcut said one runway remained closed as workers filled a deep hole in the nearby sod, but airport officials hoped the labor would be completed in time to reopen the runway later Monday night. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot lost braking and steering control during the landing. The hole in the ground formed when the plane's nose gear burrowed into the sod, Wilcut said. No one was injured in the incident, according to FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. The Airbus A-320, flying as United Flight 497 from New Orleans to San Francisco, was smoking from the nose and made a screeching sound as it landed, a witness told CNN affiliate WVUE in New Orleans. Crews evacuated passengers from the plane using the emergency slides, Lunsford said. The flight was carrying 100 passengers and five crew members, according to United. However, the NTSB said 109 people were on board. The aircraft had returned to the airport about 20 minutes after take-off due to electrical difficulties and smoke in the cockpit, the NTSB said. Airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said the airplane experienced an issue with flight instruments. The pilot had asked to land on a longer runway but was diverted to a shorter one because of workers on the first runway, Lunsford said. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report	1
Truly appreciating the beauty of Paris is a pleasure that can't be hurried. Stop, breathe, appreciate and perhaps kiss in the romantic city of Paris. Take time to wander down its wide boulevards, savour every sip of strong, black coffee and resist the temptation to fall into step with the throng of tourists and sightseers. Our advice to anyone who finds themselves with 24 hours to spare in the French capital is to stop, breathe, appreciate and indulge. Start the day with a walk down the Champs-Élysées. For some, it retains the title of the world's most beautiful avenue. For others, the road's historical charm has been blighted by the arrival of global brands, traffic and tourists. Sunrise offers the history without the hurry. Take a leisurely stroll down its expansive pavements and look up for impressive architecture without fear of bumping into shoppers. Treat yourself to breakfast at one of Paris' oldest tea salons. Ladurée was founded as a family business in 1862 and now appears in luxurious locales in London, Monaco, Switzerland and Japan. The original, Ladurée Royale on Rue Royale, doesn't open until 8:30am (and later on Sundays), so for early morning pastries drop into the Champs-Elysees store which opens at 7:30am every day. The queues at Paris' most famous art gallery, the Louvre, are notorious so impatient visitors are advised to go to the Musée de l'Orangerie, set in the historic Jardin des Tuileries. You won't see the Mona Lisa, but the gallery does boast a collection of Claude Monet's Water Lilies. The queues are shorter the earlier you go and to really beat the crowds pre-book your time slot online. Head north to have your own images sketched by street artists in Montmartre, a former stomping ground for famous names including Salvador Dali, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Drop into the Basilique du Sacré Coeur to pray, light a candle or simply enjoy the spectacular views over Paris. From there, visit Rue Lepic where you will find Café des Deux Moulins, where actress Audrey Tautou waited tables in the 2001 film "Amélie."	1
Retired army Gen. Otto Perez Molina was sworn in as Guatemala's president Saturday, pledging to take a tough stand on crime amid growing insecurity in the Central American nation. "We have to take this stand because all these people that want to kill us are people," Perez Molina said. "We're going to be very tough. We are a peace-loving people. We are going to continue to take the streets to make sure that the bad people are locked up and that we can live in peace." Perez Molina, 56, who served as the country's top general, became the first U.S.-trained commander of the Guatemalan military in 15 years. The general oversaw the military before he was appointed to the post by President Jimmy Carter.The U.S. Department of State on Wednesday approved Guatemala's withdrawal plan for a U.S.-bound military plane. Secretary of State John Kerry said he is satisfied with the way it's carried out. "We are quite glad that the planes have returned safely for their planned departure, and for that we are most grateful to the crews and to the countries involved in the safe return of the planes," Kerry told reporters in Washington.A senior Israeli official says the country is taking seriously the growing threat of Iran's nuclear program, and that Israel is prepared for a military strike against Tehran if it goes ahead with atomic work. Speaking to The Associated Press on Tuesday, the official said "all options are on the table" if Iran chooses to make a final nuclear step. Israel is deeply suspicious of Iran's nuclear ambitions, and considers any military strike by the Jewish state against Iran one of the biggest threats to regional stability.The Obama administration has approved a new military engagement with Cuba. But some questions remain about how it will affect the tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed on the island. The announcement was made Wednesday in the Oval Office by President Barack Obama, with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta at his side. “At the request of the Cuban Government, the United States will maintain a base in Cuba as a place where we can continue to conduct a robust military engagement on this island,” the president said.The United States says it's planning to deploy more military forces to Colombia to help the Colombian government fight its biggest drug war. In a speech on Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama, said that Colombia is facing "an unprecedented challenge -- the single	0
The beating of a gay man during a gay pride festival in Detroit over the weekend was caught on camera. Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hair dresser, was attacked by a group of men on iced coffee and other drinks while participating in the Detroit Pride parade, which takes place every year.According to an Associated Press report, Howard “tried to fend off a group of angry men who were harassing and taunting him using derogatory names in a group of spectators.” After the attack, police arrested the suspect, identified as 21-year-old Johnathan Brown, a.k.a. “Cedeno,” an off-duty police officer.“That’s what was really weird about that,” Howard said Monday. “There was a lot of people. And I just started getting hit, because I was trying to stand up to these guys.”It was a scene you’d expect if you were in a drag bar or drag queen contest. The two men punching and kicking Howard were dressed in blue hoodies with blue paint on the sleeves, a yellow “Pride” patch on the right chest and a pink or purple patch on the left side. One man, who was wearing a red “Detroit Pride” hoodie, also had a “I love you” tattoo on his neck.The video was initially sent to the public via Facebook but was quickly removed, and the Detroit Police Department declined to release it. The incident took place on the corner of Woodward and Gratiot, about two blocks from the Detroit Pride festival.Howard’s injuries were not immediately life-threatening. Her nose was badly cut and blood was flowing from her nose. She spent the night in the hospital and was given stitches.“I’m still in a lot of pain,” Howard said Monday morning. “I’m not really sure how long I’ve got to recover, but I just want everybody to think about it like this is a hate crime.”Howard’s story was shared on Facebook, Twitter, and other online news outlets, where her boyfriend and his mother also shared the story. The incident was also shared in the local newspaper, the Detroit Free Press.“The beating of a young girl who was just	0
It was a typical practice day for the Washington University of rowing  crew that participated in the NCAA's national championship regatta this season.Coach Peter Suter's crew, which won seven national championships since 2000, had a difficult task before them: a quick start and a big finish. To begin with, the Dons finished second to last to Stanford University in the NCAA Division III national championship regatta, finishing seventh overall and missing out on a medal.After that, there was a lot of talk surrounding the success of the team and what it might mean for Washington University as a whole. One thing was obvious: the team had to move up from sixth in the national standings."We were going to have to get up to the top, and we thought we might do it with a strong second half and a pretty solid fifth leg of the five-leg riding," said Suter, as he explained to the media. "We didn't know whether we we were going to get a medal or not, but we were going to try to get up to the top five and move on to the national meet."After the Dons finished just about where they expected to finish in the national standings, the national media had the opportunity to meet the team."It was a bit surreal," said the team's manager, Kristine Johnson. "We had just finished our last race and had won our last meet, and the national mediayeople came to see us. We were so excited, and we got a lot of fun attentions from the media."The Dons finished the season just about where they expected to finish, but they had a great year overall. "We had a really great year, and we couldn't have have asked for more," Suter said, referring to the strong season and team. "We raced very well this season and I think we came out of the race stronger as a team than we had been this season before. We took some good things out of our final race."Before the rowing season began, Suter had a very difficult decision to make about the future of the team, which had been together since 2003.	0
A day of kayaking and backpacking on Hawaii's Big Island changed in an instant as the might of the Pacific Ocean swept six teenagers into the surf. One remains missing. The group of 12 students and  four adults paddled from Puna into a storm that would later grow to become a Category 4 hurricane before the afternoon passed."My dad and I were just talking about all the people that died, and I just had to say that my dad and I are going to do this together," said 16-year-old Haley O'Brien, a senior at Punaluu High School in Pahoa, Hawaii."When I got home, I was like, 'What am I gonna do?'" Haley said. "My dad and I had a vision for us to start a charity to help people in need in the community."The vision didn't go exactly the way that Haley thought. It took months and several trips to the mainland for them to learn how to start their charity, ShareHawaii, according to Haley's teacher, Mariano Zuleta, who also is a mentor to ShareHawaii's cofounders, Haley and Tyler Lee."She was one of the first to start trying to find an organization that we could bring in as one person, and make it like a business that's not about them," Zuleta said.Haley and Tyler started ShareHawaii on May 29, 2017, the first day of that month off from school. The group raised $18,000, according to the organization's website, and their journey is set to continue when they host a grand opening and fundraising event on Saturday, June 9, at Pahoa High School."This is her dream, and it's one that she thinks is a great idea," Zuleta said. "And then to have other people who are a little bit different, I think can help bring it to life is what was exciting to her."Two years after leaving their beloved state of Texas, where they grew up, Haley and Tyler spent years traveling the country, living out of their suitcases and sharing their stories. They both graduated from Texas State, and they moved to Hawaii to start a life. But they soon found that living in Hawaii was not as easy as they had hoped."We were always in dire situations," Haley said. "We were always in debt and having a	0
Change a few circumstances in her life and Sakie Fukushima says she would have been a housewife. She was raised to be a good Japanese wife and homemaker, after all. That's what was expected of women of her generation -- to sit behind their urns in the family graves with wreaths on them. She had dreams of her own business and the future of Japan at large. "But the reality was that I became a wife and mother by the time I was 12 years old," she says. She didn't expect to have to work in a bank. And she didn't expect to have to take care of her younger brother, Hiro, at 23. His father died when he was eight years old, and Hiro lived with his parents. But then one day Hiro's father turned the family store into a grocery store, so his mother took him out to work at the grocery store. He got a job at his own father's grocery store when he was in high school. But it turned into a run of several small grocery stores and a restaurant. "When I was a little girl, Hiro used to tell me 'I'm a shopkeeper' over and over again." As his sister Sakie was growing up, his mother was working for a variety of different companies. And he was working in his father's store, which made Hiro understand what was going on with his mother: "This is what we have to do to earn a living." And then, during Sakie's teenage years, Hiro's mother died and took Hiro to Tokyo for the funeral, and then the rest is just history. "Hiro grew up with no one to support him," said Sakie. "He had to work, and then he had to work. He had to make money." And she had to take care of her younger brother, too. "I raised him alone," said Sakie. "I gave him the role of being a woman and a wife. And he was very good at that role." Hiro is now a 20-year-old graduate student. He graduated from college in Japan's ancient prefecture of Hokkaido. "He's more than that," said Sakie. "A true gentleman. Very kind and just. Very, very sweet, too." In fact, all of his teachers and even his Japanese peers called him "the flower of Hokkaido." "It is my honor to have raised a child who understands the world to be	0
Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead. Former Interior Minister Carlos Filizzola and former police chief Paulino Rojas offered resignation letters after the incident, and President Fernando Lugo accepted them Friday. Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said. The president named Ruben Candida Amarilla as the new interior minister, and Arnaldo Sanabria Moran as interim police commander. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion near the Brazilian border. About 300 law enforcement officers arrived Friday morning to serve the order when some of the approximately 100 farmers who had been occupying the land illegally for more than a month began shooting at them, authorities said. Curuguaty Hospital director Gustavo Gonzalez told the state-run Paraguay Agency of Public Information that seven policemen and more than 10 farmers were killed. Paraguay's president, once a priest, admits to fathering love child About 80 more police and civilians were wounded and were receiving medical treatment, Gonzalez added. Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said. Authorities did not detail the number of civilians killed, but they did confirm the deaths of seven police, including the chief and deputy chief of the national police's special operations unit. Police said the peasants had been camping on land owned by Blas Riquelme, a businessman and politician active in the South American nation's Colorado Party. But Jose Rodriguez, the leader of the "tent people" -- so named because they live in tents, told Radio Nacional that the peasants were on public lands that Riquelme had acquired illegally. Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police. He added that the institutions of government don't work and there is a need for agrarian reform. After the incident, Lugo sent soldiers to the zone. "All the resources of government security and strategic air are working at this moment to restore calm and tranquility to this region of the country," he said. "I have ordered the armed forces to develop their specific mission in support of the police operation."	1
President Richard M. Nixon and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici, in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile, according to a newly declassified document. President Richard M. Nixon, right, and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici. During a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was "very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field," according to the document. Nixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows. "We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends," Nixon said. Medici said he was "happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views" were so close. The declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington. The memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series. "This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil]," said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it "a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States." The two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records. "I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments," Kornbluh said.	1
Here's the reality of the situation: A diplomatic solution to Syria's use of chemical weapons will include "boots on the ground." The threat of a military solution will not. It should come as no surprise that anything other than doing  away with Assad's military presence in the country will be anathema to Obama's Democratic base.Obama's choice to attack in Syria is also driven by his desire to score political points. It sends a message to the left and to the Republican base that the administration may be ready to give up on its political objectives and instead be on "business as usual" during an election year. Obama's decision to go along with the Saudis' and the UK's demand to destroy the weapons of mass destruction in Syria and send Assad a note of caution sends a mixed message to the left about Syria's chemical weapons program, as well as to the public. It says "We believe the U.S. is still on the right side of this fight, and we'll continue to be there."But the real reason to attack is the threat it poses to Obama's reelection campaign. The president's decision to go along with the Saudis and the UK will cost him several hundred million dollars and it will cost American lives. The chemical attack in Syria this week, as well as recent chemical attacks in Yemen and the attack on two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, are a reminder that not only is the U.S. on the side of the Israelis — it is on the side of the Saudis, the U.K., and the rest of the Arab League, as well.That leaves us with two options:1) Assad and the Syrian government are using chemical weapons against the opposition, in violation of the terms of the deal the United States and other nations negotiated in the wake of the 2011 Arab uprising against Assad.2) The international coalition has gone too far to call it off, and the U.S. will not give up its fight against Assad and his allies. The president has declared his willingness to go along with military intervention. So the question is this: will Obama continue to send the American people into battle, or will he get out first? Will he, with the blessing of Congress, give up the fight against Assad and his allies, or will he get out of the way of the slaughter and keep the United States on the right side of history?	0
Not one, but two French citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, both of them 22-year-old men who went to Syria to join the group, authorities said Wednesday. The Paris prosecutor's office on Wednesday Â­— which is handling the investigation into the two men and their motivations — Â­said it had been able to identify the two French nationals who were connected with the beheadings.The two men were identified as Mohamed Abrini , 22, of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in northern Paris, and his friend, Mohamed Brahim , 23, of Montrouge in eastern Paris, the prosecutor's office said. Both were French citizens.During the video that appears to show the beheading of American journalist James Foley, Brahim is seen holding a sword and Abrini is seen with the same weapon. Both men were arrested in France on Tuesday with other militants in connection with the beheading.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxIn a statement, the French foreign ministry called the slayings un-Islamic."The killing of James Foley is an un-Islamic, merciless, cruel and inhuman act," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.The Paris prosecutor's office described the two men as French nationals in a statement Wednesday, saying they had voluntarily gone to Syria and were subsequently captured, interrogated and held as suspects in connection with a suspected terrorist group."For reasons related to the investigation, the two individuals had gone to a unit of the Islamic State that has specialized in filming videos and is responsible for the preparation of the videos that have been delivered," the statement said.The two were considered to be "the second-most-wanted men in Syria," the prosecutor's office said.The two men are still considered unharmed in the custody of the police, the prosecutor's office said.Paris prosecutor's office spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet confirmed their arrests and said the two suspects were planning to return to France.French president designate Francois Hollande said Wednesday that those responsible for Foley's death "should be hunted down and brought to justice.""For two days we've been watching the horrific video that shows James Foley. If he were a Muslim it would be considered a religious crime," Hollande told a news conference. "My thoughts are	0

Kayla Mueller made helping people her life's work. After graduating from college in 2009, she traveled to northern India, the Palestinian territories and Israel to assist humanitarian groups, her family said through a spokeswoman. She then went to Syria to help people whose lives had been torn apart by war, especially children. "Syrians are dying by the thousands and they're fighting just to talk about the rights we have," the humanitarian worker told The Daily Courier, her hometown paper in Prescott, Arizona, in 2013. "For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal." ISIS said in an online posting this month that a female American it was holding had died in a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, Syria. The Mueller family confirmed her death on Tuesday and said ISIS took her captive in August 2013. Mueller, 26, grew up in Prescott, a town of about 40,000 people 100 miles north of Phoenix. She showed an early inclination for travel and humanitarian work, according to a September 2007 profile in The Daily Courier. "I love cultures and language and learning about people's cultures," Mueller, then 19, said in the article. Before going to Northern Arizona University, she worked for the Save Darfur Coalition, wrote letters to members of Congress, took part in environmental causes and was honored with a local award for activism, the article said. "I always feel that no matter how much I give I always get back more though these projects," she said. Mueller continued her activism at Northern Arizona University. Carol Thompson, a politics and international affairs professor there, called Mueller a "brilliant" student who asked tough questions and cared deeply about issues of peace, inequality and justice. The two also worked together on Save Darfur and as anti-war activists to make sure that returning veterans were welcomed back to the community. "Well beyond the classroom, she was a peacemaker," said Thompson, who last saw Mueller in 2012 and who is currently on a sabbatical in Zimbabwe. After graduating, Mueller became a globetrotter. Read a letter written by Kayla Mueller last year She spent two years living and working with humanitarian  groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories, according to a family spokeswoman. In Israel, she volunteered at the African Refugee Development Center.	1
October 2, 2014 From the District of Columbia to the Korean Peninsula to Saudi Arabia, we're going globetrotting this Thursday. Â Our Global Expressions team of writers are ready to cover what they're covering, though it's not exactly like traveling down the Yellow Brick Road, as some of the images we'll be taking are decidedly less pleasant. Â Our travels will inevitably take us into conflict zones or places where our favorite foods are consumed in a manner that would be considered barbaric in many of the places in the world we'll be visiting. Â But we'll be able to make up for our lack of culinary adventure by taking some incredible and beautiful photos along the way. Â As you'll quickly see, travel can be pretty great when it's not as boring as an airport or a hotel room.For all of your travel photography needs, check out our photo collections here.So, without further ado, here is our Global Expressions Global Photo Round Up 2014:AfghanistanThe first stop on this trip is Afghanistan, and the first time we visited this former war-torn country, we took a road trip along the Hindu Kush mountains. Â The rugged terrain and intense heat made for interesting photography conditions, but we discovered that our cameras were better used to capturing the beautiful snow-covered mountains and snow-capped mountainsides. Â The images below show some of the many different environments that we saw over the course of our trip.Afghanistan: Â Snow-covered MountainsAfghanistan: Â Snow-Capped MountainAfghanistan: Â Hindu Kush MountainsKabulIf it's not the capital of Afghanistan, then it's probably the most fascinating part of the country. Â It's where Kabul International Airport is located, it's where our host family lives, and it's where our guide took us to do the most interesting tour we had to offer. Â We saw numerous monuments, the infamous Uruzgan Airfield and the huge open air palace, but our favorite was definitely the Bamiyan Buddha, which is a museum dedicated to the life of the Buddha, and was built by the people of the ancient Hindu Kush mountains. Â The statues were so incredibly lifelike, that the photographs were more like a video tape than a photograph, though this was a very special tour.Bamiyan	0
Following the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009, the attempted car bomb in Times Square in May and a number of other domestic cases, including the recent arrest of a Somali-American teenager in Portland, Oregon, U.S. security agencies are sharply focused on the potential "radicalization" of American-Muslims and how to prevent it. Many look across the Atlantic to the experience of Britain. Following the July 2005 attacks on London's transport system, a "counter-radicalization" strategy known as Preventing Violent Extremism was introduced. Dubbed Prevent for short, the strategy aims to intervene in the dynamics of Muslim communities to win over hearts and minds and secure allegiance to Western liberal democracy. Prevent has two prongs. First, it seeks to sponsor moderate Muslim organizations to oppose "the ideology of violent extremism" (a British government phrase that is deliberately obscure) and promote accommodation with the West. Hundreds of millions of pounds of government funding have been made available to those willing to take on this task. Second, it seeks to profile individuals suspected of drifting toward "radicalization," that is, the adoption of extremist ideas. Through an elaborate system of surveillance involving teachers and youth workers among others, would-be radicals are identified and given counseling, mentoring and religious instruction in an attempt to divert them from their extremist views. Many in Washington tout a Prevent-like program as an essential weapon in what they see as the "war within," the next phase of America's War on Terror. Governments cannot wait, they argue, until terrorist ideas turn into terrorist actions; there has to be some form of intervention earlier in the process to discourage those ideas from circulating. And in a liberal society, where ideas themselves cannot easily be criminalized, something like Prevent is a viable and necessary alternative, they argue. With the U.S. government already dedicating vast resources to profiling would-be extremists and recruiting Muslim groups as homeland security partners, the building blocks of an American version of Prevent are already in place. But in Britain, the harm done by Prevent has far outweighed any advantages. I spent a year researching the effects of Prevent on England's Muslim communities. I got documents detailing the full extent of the surveillance involved and spoke to community leaders, grassroots activists, women and young people.	1
Four members of a group of 31 North Koreans who accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat, have decided to defect to the South, despite Pyongyang's demands that they all be repatriated to the North, the South Korean Red Cross said. The defection of the four North Koreans could spark tensions on the peninsula, where joint U.S.-South Korea military drills have kicked off this week. North Korea had threatened to engulf Seoul in a "sea of flames," a day before the opening of the exercise. The South will return the remaining 27 members of the group through Panmunjom, a truce village on the ground border between the two sides, and send the fishing boat back through the waters in the West Sea on Friday, the Red Cross said. South Korea's intelligence agency questioned the North Koreans for almost a month since they crossed over in February before deciding to release the group, the aid agency said. There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The number of annual defectors has risen dramatically since the turn of the century and continues to climb. Defectors who are forcefully repatriated to the North after attempting to cross over into third countries such as China, Mongolia or Southeast Asia are commonly sent to prison camps as a punishment. Many defectors who live in South Korea fear for the lives of their family or relatives who remain in the North.	1
Pop-country singer Patti Page died on January 1st in Encinitas, California. She was 85. Born Clara Ann Fowler, Page was the best-selling  female singer in the history of American pop music. Page is probably best remembered for her song "Walk Away Renée", a hit in 1959, and for her 1960 recording of "The Letter". She was also responsible for the songs "A Woman's Worth" and "I Had a Love", both of which were hits in 1964.In addition to her solo recordings, Page contributed the song, "You Are My Sunshine", which was performed by many radio and television stations when the song first came on the air. The song also became the theme song at many children's hospitals and a symbol of hope to those who suffer from terminal illnesses.In an interview with David Brumley for the BBC in 1963 Page said of "You Are My Sunshine": "I felt that a woman should be able to do as much for men as a man can do for himself, but I'm sorry I've had to disappoint you. Because the women have been very careful to say... 'Well, she's not your type' And that's just been a lot of what women say. And I say: 'No, don't worry about it, you're not the only one.' So I don't mind doing what I can."In 1963 Page was introduced to the world by Don Rickles as being the leading female artist of her day. "She knows more about love than many men," said Rickles, then the host of NBC's Tonight Show. She said she had always sung. "I just sang. I don't know how. I just sung."Page was given a five-carat diamond ring by Elvis Presley. She lived in Las Vegas, first in a small apartment and then in a penthouse with four bedrooms and six bathrooms. In Las Vegas she met the young singer Johnny Mathis.Page was awarded two Presidential Medals of Freedom. In 1991, her name appeared on a Wall of Honor on the floor of the US Supreme Court. The next year she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Page and Elvis Presley were first married on September 17, 1953. They later divorced and separated on February 2nd, 1956. In September of that year, Page and Presley took a trip to Mexico, where they had	0
The Department of Defense announced Tuesday that capital charges have been refiled against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001, conspiracy to allow prosecution before a military commission at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base. The move comes after the Obama administration dropped plans to prosecute the suspects in federal court in New York. Besides Mohammed, the other suspects accused of participating in the 9/11 plot are Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. All five are at Guantanamo. A Pentagon statement said the charges "allege that the five accused were responsible for the planning and execution" of the 9/11 attacks, resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. Charges against all five accused include conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, hijacking aircraft and terrorism, the statement said. The filing of capital charges means the defendants could face death sentences if convicted. The final decision about whether the death penalty can be pursued is in the hands of retired Vice Adm. Bruce McDonald. In military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions, the equivalent of a civilian criminal court. The last military execution was in 1961, involving a U.S. Army private who had been convicted of rape and attempted murder of an Austrian girl. Mohammed was first charged in May 2008 before a military commission in Guantanamo, but the charges were suspended in early 2009 when the Obama administration took over and sought a fresh review of all detainees at the overseas prison. Later that year, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Mohammed and several other key terror suspects would face prosecution in the military justice system. The Obama administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the United States for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts. But after widespread opposition across the political platform, the president announced earlier this year all prosecutions would be in military courts in Guantanamo. Obama also had pledged to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within a year of becoming president. However, it remains open due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high-profile suspects in U.S. criminal courts. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this story.	1
Four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said Thursday they will challenge Arizona's new immigration law, which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the American Civil Liberties ..."So many of my friends are afraid to have babies right now," she says. "They think the baby will die in the U.S. and they'll get deported." She has been waiting to have a baby in the U.S. for five years, since her parents fled from Guatemala for the U.S. They came to the U.S. legally as children, but were eventually deported."We had to run away," Luz told me. "When we had to get pregnant, our friends said 'you can't do that in this country. Too many people will kill you.' But we decided that we can make America great by loving our country, so we decided to make this our country.""This is an emergency," she says. "The police are already being attacked in the streets, and they're not responding, and so we are going to demand the government has to do something."In fact, some of those same protesters turned out in the last few hours to protest the Department of Justice's decision to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples in federal courthouses across the country. Although most gay couples won't be able to marry in the courts until at least December, tens of thousands who have already applied waited almost two months for the licenses to be issued.The government's legal authority to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples stems from the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996. It defines marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, making it illegal to have a marriage in which either party is a man or a woman. The Supreme Court has upheld this law as a valid government restriction on gay and lesbian couples who wish to marry.But that's exactly what's driving activists who marched and demonstrated in cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Seattle, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. The organizers of this week's demonstrations, who identified themselves as a network of "grass-roots" organizations that support the immigrant community, say that this bill, and the Department of Justice's decision to uphold these laws, will make the American dream less attainable for gay and lesbian	0

Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating. In fact, the Chinese are so committed to the day they celebrate it twice. There's qixi, China's equivalent to Valentine's Day, which takes place in August, as well as the global version coming up on Saturday. Both are embraced with gusto by couples across the country. In the spirit of the season, we've put together a tongue-in-cheek guide to getting a date in China that also aims to shed a little light on the pursuit of love in the Middle Kingdom. 1) Head to a park. They're a real-life Tinder Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children. They bedeck the park's trees with their offspring's college photos and sheets of paper listing their key dating characteristics. Why not visit your local stretch of green this Saturday then? It's the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone -- meet your future love and your future in-laws. 2) If you're from Beijing, work it Remember that 1990s film "Green Card" starring Andie MacDowell and Gerard Depardieu? It did raise one key dating point -- passports and permits matter. Nowhere else is this more so than in China, where one of the top assets people look for in a lover (after the oft-cited house and car) is whether they have a permit to the city they wish to live in. The hukou, as it is known, is tied to a host of social benefits. With it, your life is easy. Without it, not so much. If you happen to have a hukou that allows you to live in one of China's premier cities, be sure to let lots of singles around you know. 3) Parents are a useful resource. They might even join on a date	1
Lance Armstrong has been asked to return all prize money from his seven annulled Tour de France victories by the sport's governing body, who confirmed the history books will show no winner of the famous race between 1999-2005. The disgraced American rider will also have to donate $20m to charity."Lance has a lot of explaining to do," said Chris Froome, the 2009 Tour winner and two-time Tour de France victor. "He cheated his way to the victory.""I think people need to be aware of all the ramifications of what he did."The revelations will take place after a court trial against Armstrong, who had denied the allegations during a dramatic two-and-a-half week hearing.Armstrong's lawyers had argued in a pre-trial motion that the allegations were untrue. But the sport's anti-doping authorities said a full confession was needed to establish doping.Armstrong was charged by the UCI with using performance-enhancing drugs, after a lengthy investigation that began in October. The US anti-doping agency, the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), has said it believes Armstrong's blood and urine samples contained steroids and EPO.The Tour de France was stripped of its title after the UCI's court of inquiry, which published its findings in February. Armstrong denied the charges, and said he would fight the case.Armstrong said the evidence against him was "the complete and utter sham."Armstrong's legal team have said his allegations will be heard in an appeal against the decision which was made by the UCI's Appeals Court earlier this year.The UCI's ruling in the case, which came just before the Tour de France race, was the first ruling made in a matter of months, following a long period of time in which many sporting controversies dominated the news.Last year it was uncovered that Armstrong had taken steroids during his time with US Postal Service and US Postal Service pro team. In 2011, it was revealed that Armstrong had used the blood-flow-enhancing drug EPO during the 1999 Tour de France. The former world champion was also caught using banned performance-enhancing drugs at the Tour de France in 1996 by French police.Usada said Usada's report, which concluded there was sufficient evidence to suggest doping, was "supported by numerous other evidence	0
A Chicago pediatrician who "felt called" to move to Afghanistan to treat children and train physicians was among three Americans killed Thursday at a Kabul hospital by an Afghan guard. The police guard opened fire on the urn containing the body of a 22-year-old doctor. The United States confirmed the death of the doctor in a statement Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said the doctor's parents had reached out to the U.S. Embassy and was "an American citizen" who had traveled there "on a temporary mission."The medical team at Camp Addeek, a U.S.-funded Afghan medical facility in Kabul, was also among those injured in the incident.It was not immediately clear whether the medical personnel was targeted.The doctor's parents have asked that they be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, where his father served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. The family has also asked that the military allow him to be buried at Arlington and the government has said that it will honor that request.President Trump's condemnation of the killing of the doctor was swift on Twitter Thursday."Our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of Dr. John James Patric, who was killed while at work in Kabul, Afghanistan," the president said. "We send our thoughts and prayers to his family, and thank them for their courage and their sacrifice. For all Americans, our prayers are with you also."U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, John Bass, said in a statement Friday that the doctor's "family is greatly beloved to us, as we grieve with them."More than 20,000 people have been killed in Afghanistan since the U.S. invaded in 2001, according to the United Nations. Nearly half are children.The hospital where the doctor was buried was damaged by an explosion April 2, days after the U.S. killed Osama bin Laden when he took refuge at a compound on a compound in Pakistan. The compound was a site used as a training ground in recent years for the Afghan and Pakistani governments.The bombing was the deadliest in Afghanistan in more than a decade, according to police. The attack on the hospital has prompted the U.S. Embassy to move the embassy from Kabul to the Afghan capital."The embassy is safe and secure and our staff and personnel continue to take care of the needs of our Afghan	0
Federal officials charged 20 people Wednesday in a scheme to recruit illegal immigrants from Russia and Eastern European countries to work as exotic dancers in New York strip clubs, according to Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Charges against the 20 individuals include racketeering, extortion, visa and marriage fraud, and transporting and harboring illegal immigrants. The accused are alleged to be members of the Gambino and Bonanno organized crime families, according to federal authorities. "The defendants themselves had one thing in common -- the desire to turn the women they allegedly helped enter this country illegally into their personal profit centers,"Bharara said. "Today's arrests have brought an end to their illicit activities." Several of the accused are alleged to have run the "Strip Club Enterprise," which controlled a series of strip clubs throughout Queens and Long Island. Through these clubs, the accused are alleged to have recruited Eastern European women to enter the United States on student J1 visas to perform as strippers in their enterprises. Prosecutors also charge the defendants threatened physical violence and economic harm if the owners and operators of New York strip clubs as part of a broad extortion scheme. "The defendants controlled their business and protected their turf through intimidation and threats of physical and economic harm," said James T. Hayes, Jr., special agent in charge with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which led the investigation. "Today's arrests bring to an end a long-standing criminal enterprise operated by colluding organized crime entities that profited wildly through a combination of extortion and fraud." Some of the exotic dancers brought illegally into the United States were also matched with U.S. citizens in fraudulent marriages to resolve their immigrations status, prosecutors said in the indictment. Before dawn on Wednesday, federal agents arrived at Cheetah's Gentlemans Club and Restaurant off Times Square in Manhattan, Gallagher's 2000 in Queens, NY, and seven other New York-area strip clubs and confiscated files and documents. Attorneys for those indicted were not immediately available for comment.	1
If you were planning on using a Taylor Swift-penned phrase on, say, a locket or a jewelry box, think again. Because you could be trying to shake off a legal bill. T. Swizzle, whose business savvy is rivaled only by her aptitude for earworms, has taken out several trademarks for phrases like "Party Like It's 1989," "This Sick Beat," "Cause We Never Go Out of Style." This means you'll need Swift's permisison if you want to use any of those phrases on a whole host of stuff: aprons, "non-medicated" toiletries and -- we kid you not -- walking sticks. The filings are on top of dozens more she's held for years. They were reported by Vox, citing the legal database, Justia. Interestingly enough, "Shake It Off" is not on the list. Perhaps because that trademark is already held by a diet company. Swift took out the trademarks last year on the heels of her fifth studio album, "1989." Given the incredible success of that album, you can't blame a girl for wanting to protect her brand. And if you're hate, hate, hating on her for that, well, you know what you can do. Swift sends epic care package to fan	1
The Obama administration plans to announce Wednesday the creation of seven "climate hubs" to provide information to rural communities facing extreme weather conditions. The hubs by the U .S. Department  of Agriculture, U .S. Forest Service and others will provide information about climate change and ways to build resilient communities, the White House said.The announcement came amid a recent surge of violent weather across the nation, including deadly hurricane season storms in Florida, as well as wildfires across the American West.The hubs will create "strong local partnerships" with communities in need of assistance, and a website will be established to provide updates on efforts being made in their communities.The hubs also will provide information on energy production, clean energy and energy efficiency, as well as agriculture and forest management.The administration has been under pressure from conservationists and the environmental community to do more to address the climate crisis."It's been a really difficult year with the extreme weather," National Wildlife Federation's President Collin O'Mara told ABC News . "The Trump administration's policies are all oriented toward cutting back on environmental enforcement, cutting back on science-based protections at the EPA. This is really important when you think about climate change, for not just our children, but for all of us."President Donald Trump also has recently announced his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and has said that scientists are "great hoax."But the White House said Wednesday that the country should be using fossil fuels in accordance with international commitments, to avoid catastrophic climate change."The government is committed to using abundant domestic fossil fuels to ensure a healthy planet and a safe climate for our children," the White House said in a statement.When asked about how Trump's environmental policies will affect the administration's efforts to combat climate change, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters it's "unlikely" that Trump will put any limitations on U .S. energy production."In the short term, we are going to see a continued increase in domestic fossil fuel production," Spicer said."If you look historically, we've had increasing energy production, a declining trend in greenhouse gas emissions," he said, pointing to the fact that we're now producing more energy than ever before in the history of the country."Every day, I'm getting e-mails from constituents that say the president's rhetoric has really been confusing	0

Two tech companies are offering a free tool to defeat sophisticated malicious software that criminals have used to extract millions of dollars ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from unsuspecting businesses.ÂBusinesses are now at risk of hackers exploiting flaws in their networks to steal confidential company data and destroy it.Yet few companies can afford a complete security overhaul.Enter Webroot, a company that has built a business around helping businesses protect their critical data.Webroot will offer a free tool to businesses for their "critical servers." The free tool is intended to plug security holes in these servers.The company is working with an international team of cybersecurity experts who have tested it.The tool offers "a one-time password that allows the customer to protect servers from a wide variety of targeted attacks," the company said in a news release. The tool is available now.But Webroot doesn't stop there. The company is also preparing a second free tool for corporate customers who are considering using their cloud servers for storing or processing the company's confidential data.It's part of a broader suite of free tools Webroot is offering, including a free password lifter that helps users change passwords often and at random; a free software patch that can disable malware that's been inserted or installed on a computer; anti-spam software that has been updated to make email spam more resistant to attacks; and a free tool that will allow companies to monitor and protect their networked devices.The company's goal is not making money, it's about helping businesses protect themselves against a growing problem that can hurt their bottom line."The problem is that you've got a high-tech, very competent, sophisticated hacker who knows his way around your network," said Jim Good, chief executive officer of Webroot, in a phone interview with CNNMoney. "You've got to make sure you get all your data and your employees' data off before you get that hacker to come in to steal them."The company didn't provide an example of how its free cybersecurity tools could help defend against attacks, but it's using the company's own product for proof of concept testing.In May, Webroot's free tools were used to prevent more than $1 million worth of financial data from being stolen when an automated computer program stole data from a retailer, a bank	0
The state of New Jersey is imposing harsher restrictions on Ferris wheel safety after an 11-year-old rider fell to her death earlier this month. Officials are mandating riders be at least 54 utes old or use a helmet and face shield.The state now requires ride operators to have a certain range of age, a helmet, and a face shield.That’s the law, but it’s too soon to know how it will reduce serious injury and death.Ferris wheel injury statisticsThe National Fire and Emergency Management Association found in their 2013 State of the Fire Ferris Wheel report that injuries were still very common during the 2011 season.In New Jersey, there were 5,300 injuries related to Ferris wheel rides, most of which involved head trauma.Of those, about half of the injuries were serious enough to require surgery, though in many of the cases, the injuries were minor.More than 5,000 of those injuries came from the rides at Walt Disney World.The NAFMEA’s report said the majority of the injuries were severe enough to delay return to work for at least two weeks.They were also the most common reason for trips taken to the emergency room, which accounted for 5 percent of all injuries.Nearly half of those injuries involved the neck, face, or back.That’s the result of an average height limit and a requirement that every ride be at least 1,500 feet tall, which limits the riders’ head room.The height requirement is meant to stop riders from falling out of the ride carriages and could cause injuries, according to the NAFMEA.Other safety concernsThe height and age requirements were both imposed by state officials.But the height restriction could prevent riders from reaching the top and dropping out of the ride, while the age limit could impact safety and could prevent seniors from riding, according to officials in Pennsylvania.More: NAFMEA: Ferris wheel injury statisticsThe NAFMEA also pointed to a concern over the speed of the rides.The company operating the rides, AEG, was the subject of a 2013 court settlement with more than a dozen states, which banned its ride from operating in states that regulated speed.In that settlement, AEG agreed to pay $15.4	0
Along with math, science and social studies, gun safety could soon be part of the first-grade curriculum in some Missouri public schools. A new measure that advocates for such classes for first-graders was signed into law last  August and is set to take effect in 2022, but some parents are pushing to scrap the provision entirely.They cite the lack of scientific data that would be used in the classroom, the burden that the new classes would place on local schools, the expense and the fact that the U.S. Department of Education has not approved their inclusion on the first-grade curriculum.A coalition of nearly 70 organizations and groups, including more than two dozen cities, counties, universities, parents, educators and gun control advocates, is seeking a change in the law that would put the safety classes off limits.“There are no scientific studies. The classes are not based on scientific evidence,” Beth Thompson, a lawyer and member of the coalition, told Fox News. “At the end of the day, my kids in first grade are in first-grade English class. I don’t want them to use their brains to think about gun safety.”Another group, the Coalition for Gun Safety, which also represents parents and gun safety advocates, contends that the laws are a means to keep children from being trained to use guns during school hours.“This legislation is not about making schools safer,” said coalition president Jeff Dunlap of Bellevue, Washington. “This legislation is all about a law that will restrict gun ownership, particularly for children,” he said, adding that the “no guns” language in the law is “very similar” to language found in the Gun Violence Prevention Act of 2017. “I would argue that the language in the legislation is as anti-gun as any legislative language we’ve ever heard,” Dunlap said.The American Federation of Teachers, which represents about 600,000 teaching and school support professionals, is also against the proposal.“The federal government should not be in the education business, and it certainly shouldn’t be in the business of controlling the firearm industry,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “As educators and researchers, the Department of Education should be examining policies and practices of all major sectors of our society, not just the firearms	0
The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate U.S. prohibitions against torture unless they "have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering," according to a previously secret Justice Department memo released Thursday. Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft testifies before Congress July 17 about waterboarding. The interrogator's "good faith" and "honest belief" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. "Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture," Jay Bybee, then the assistant attorney general, wrote in the memo. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others. Another memo released Thursday advises that "the waterboard," or simulated drowning, does "not violate the Torture Statute." It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling "which raises possible concerns about future U.S. judicial review of the [interrogation] Program." A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which "enhanced interrogation techniques" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003. The memos were made public by the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the three CIA-related documents under Freedom of Information Act requests. "These documents supply further evidence, if any were needed, that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to torture prisoners in its custody," said Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU National Security Project. The Bush administration has consistently denied that the United States tortures detainees. Reports say the CIA waterboarded three "high-value detainees," including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, although former Justice Department official Daniel Levin suggested in congressional testimony in June that there had been more than three instances of the practice, which critics call torture. The third document released Thursday was blacked out except for a line saying "Unless otherwise approved by Headquarters, CIA officers (redacted) may use only Permissible Interrogation Techniques. Permissible Interrogation Techniques consist of both (a) Standard Techniques and (b) Enhanced Techniques," plus the instruction for interrogators to keep records of sessions in which enhanced interrogation techniques are used.	1
A powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Mexico's Baja Peninsula Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as the area around the epicenter is sparsely populated, said a spokeswoman for the Baja California Sur's Civil Protection Office. She said many people there were nervous because earthquakes are rare in the area. The quake's epicenter was 47 miles (75 kilometers) north of La Paz, Mexico, USGS said. The quake was more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, the agency said.	1
Kurt Haskell's eyes were locked on the seatback monitor in front of him when the words of a passing flight attendant caught his attention. "She said something smells like smoke," recalled Haskell, a passenger on Northwest Airlines  flight 1067 that was flying over the Gulf of Mexico."I looked at the monitor, and I said, 'Smoke!' Sure enough, the smoke alarms began to blare," Haskell remembered, and a video that passengers had seen earlier popped on the monitor.At that point, Haskell recalls, "I told the pilot to abort the flight, and we landed."That was almost 12 years ago. Since then, Haskell has become an award-winning investigative reporter for the Seattle Times who has gone to such extremes to figure out what happened to flight 1067. His articles have helped to expose problems in the plane's systems, helped to identify other planes in distress and put out false alarms. And in 2014, he received a MacArthur "genius" fellowship, called a fellowship to focus on "creating and sustaining meaningful change."Haskell's path to an investigative and public-interest career has been largely public relations, but it has brought him to the front lines of one of the nation's largest safety scandals.The Boeing 737 MAX jetliner has been grounded until investigators can figure out what went wrong and what can be improved. The problem began with an in-flight fire in May 2019, and investigators concluded that the jet's oxygen sensor went into a state of "thermal overload," causing it to overheat and go into a dive that caused the crash.More:Pilots of plane crashes in the past 20 years have had more than 1,000 flight hoursMore:Aviation safety record has gotten worse, study saysMore:How a new Boeing 737 MAX flight-control system may be to blame for 'Odyssey' tragedyHaskell was on the Boeing 737 Max flight that crashed. He got on the plane at the last minute to find out how it would land and what he would see.He took a seat beside American Airlines pilot Kevin Smith and began to read about how to use the cockpit's "hands-on" system, a feature that allows a pilot to manipulate the plane's throttle and other controls with their hands."I decided that I would take up the challenge," Haskell says.

The idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good. Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.  Yet on a finite Earth, with a billion new people being added every 15 years, that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent.  Sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis. The reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed.  Unleash greed, the theory goes, and type-A personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses, invent new products, and thereby raise well-being. And in some sense, there's a lot to say for this theory.  After all, the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in Britain around 1800, and for most of the world, living standards have risen markedly along the way. Yet history has also taught us that the "Invisible Hand" of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks. Instead, untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud, mega-tax evasion, pervasive bribery, modern slavery, rising inequalities, and environmental destruction. Perhaps most important, it feeds moral blindness.  Too many of the super-rich, whether they are calling for drilling in the Arctic for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods, simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet. It¹s no surprise that the Wall Street Journal runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis.  The environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed.  And greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism. Novelists, ethicists, activists, unionists, preachers, teachers, and others have long known these facts, but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame. Unleash greed as the supreme economic good, and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter. Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability.	1
Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say human trafficking has seen "alarming growth" in the region. The 60 bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay issued a statement after a meeting in Argentina last week, calling the practice "a shameful and outrageous reality" and pledging to do more to fight it. "We warn of the existence of organized mafias that use smaller networks that are present in nearly all of our cities and towns," the statement said. Learn more at The CNN Freedom Project Citing reports from global nonprofit groups, the bishops noted that child sex trafficking rings were also operating in the area. The bishops pledged to raise awareness of the problem, push for legal reforms and assist victims -- noting that within the church there had been "an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people (to the church), and the absence of a more decisive and broad response to the problem (of human trafficking)." Such an approach is not surprising, said Sergio Rubin, a journalist who has written extensively about the Catholic Church in Argentina. "The church is assuming its role, and they believe that they must work a lot more in the formation of religious values," Rubin said. Mario Ganora, a lawyer who works with La Alameda, an Argentinian nonprofit that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was connected to an increase in drug consumption. "How? ... The women who are used for sex trafficking are also used for the delivery of drugs," he said. According to official data from Argentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a higher number than the entire previous trimester.	1
On the grainy, silent black and white video, it's hard to tell exactly what happened the night of June 14 in Miami Beach. But one thing is certain: A tourist, Husien Shehada, can be seen falling to the ground, shot by a Miami Beach Police officer after an altercation in front of a local nightclub.Shehada, a Muslim who had taken his own life, was shot in the head at close range, officials say. He died two days later, from a bullet wound to the right side of his head.Now, Shehada's family and friends want to know what happened to the officer who fired the shot that killed their brother.They have filed a civil rights lawsuit against the police force in Miami-Dade County.Shehada's family released a letter in July that says, "We believe this officer and all those involved in this tragic incident are guilty. We believe the officer intentionally shot our brother in the head as a result of bias or bigotry, in the hopes that it would justify taking away our brother's life."And it's not the first time a cop has been found guilty of shooting a man with his service weapon.In 2012, a police officer in Louisiana was found guilty of manslaughter for fatally shooting a 25-year-old man in the neck inside his own home. The fatal shooting was captured on video.In 2013, a Miami-Dade County deputy was charged with killing the man he shot over a disturbance on the streets of southwest Miami.The case drew national attention. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Alliance to end Police Misconduct filed a lawsuit along with the family of the man shot by the officer in 2012. The lawsuit argues that the man would not have been shot by the officer if not for a "tense and volatile situation."And then came this video.Now, the family and friends of Husien Shehada, the 22-year-old man who was shot by the officer in June, say they want the Miami-Dade PD to answer for his death.A civil rights suit has been filed against the Miami Beach Police Department, the city, Police Chief Manuel Orosa, and the city attorney."Their actions in the case of Husien Shehada have violated my brother's constitutional rights under the U.S. constitution and	0
Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler. The government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen here in January, is facing elections in July. Abraham Gonzalez, a key official for the powerful ministry that oversees Mexico's government, also resigned. So did Sergio Vela Martinez, president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts. No official reasons were given for any of the resignations, which analysts said did not appear to be related. But at least two of the resignations did not come as a surprise. Tellez, who stepped down from a Cabinet-level post, had been involved for weeks in a controversy over taped comments revealed last month by CNN journalist Carmen Aristegui. In the taped conversation, Tellez said former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had stolen government money. Salinas has not been formally accused of any crime. Tellez received an anonymous threat in late February from an apparent political enemy telling him to resign or more damaging audiotapes would be released to the media. He refused and turned the matter over to authorities. Ana Maria Salazar Slack, a political analyst who is host of a daily radio show in Mexico City, called it "an almost soap opera-ish scandal" that left Calderon little choice but to force Tellez to resign. "Although Calderon wanted to keep him in office, it made it very difficult to keep him there," she said. Calderon moved Tellez to a post as a presidential aide dealing with economic matters. Other observers also were not surprised by the move. "That was waiting to happen," said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. "But evidently the president values his counsel and has kept him in a high-profile position in the presidency from which he'll continue to have influence." Robert Pastor, the Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, praised Tellez but said political considerations prevailed. "He's a very competent fellow," Pastor said. "One of the most competent people I've known in Mexico. But this tape in particular was very embarrassing." In a televised news conference after Calderon announced the changes, Tellez expressed his "gratitude for this opportunity that few Mexicans obtain."	1
A referendum over Catalonia's future as a part of Spain has been put on hold. Spain's Constitutional Court on Monday suspended the planned referendum on independence for Spain's Catalonia region set to  take place on September 1. The vote is to decide whether Catalonia breaks away from Spain. A Spanish court rejected the Catalan request to hold the referendum, arguing that self-determination is not a right and that it can have no effect on the constitutional order of Spain.The European Union announced that it will review Spain's plan to suspend Catalonia's right to self-determination and that if it decides to impose sanctions, the move would be "part of an EU strategy that supports legitimate territorial, language and other forms of self-determination". It also said that the "right to self-determination does not undermine the fundamental rights of another. That being said, the European Union reaffirms its support for the Spanish constitutional order and its commitments to respect the legal order of the country as agreed upon in the Treaty of European Union". The EU said that "although the issue is of the highest importance in the context of the Spanish constitutional order, the EU can only take a political decision when faced with this situation following a review of the situation by the Spanish Government, considering all the facts and taking into account the relevant national and international commitments". It added that "The European Commission is not and will not be a mediator in the Catalan case".The European Commission said that "The Commission has always shown a willingness to react to serious violations of EU law and has made a number of interventions in recent years on various issues. Today we are facing a situation where, through its use of the prerogative of the Spanish Government, the Spanish Government has shown its determination to undermine the entire democratic process and thus the principle of the rule of law, including the right of self-determination recognised and cherished by a number of Member States. This is the context in which the Commission can and will act in order to defend the rule of law and the rights of the European Union and EU citizens".On Friday, Spain's foreign ministry issued a statement that the government's decision is "unacceptable", adding that it will defend the right of self-determination for Catalonia.A Catalan pro-independence group on Monday called on supporters to march in the capital and other major cities on September 1 to voice their "resistance" against the Spanish government.The Spanish government's decision to suspend the referendum could have an	0
Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles has announced that he will run in next month's presidential election to replace the late Hugo Chavez. He faces an uphill battle against acting President Nicolas Maduro, who was  recently re-elected after a controversial election in which he faced a jail sentence for money laundering.The election will take place on April 16, and will be followed by a runoff election on April 30. Capriles has said he will appeal against Maduro's jail sentence if he is elected. Maduro's government has also issued a statement saying it would seek to have Capriles put on trial.Opposition candidate Leopoldo Lopez said he would hold a press conference Wednesday afternoon in a bid to calm public outrage."We are going to denounce the Maduro regime. We will have actions in the public square. I think the people have understood our positions, so the people have a responsibility in the public square. We must take this responsibility," Lopez said during a press conference in Caracas."We demand nothing from the government: we will not block the door or stop the people from voting. The people know what's better for us, they know that the best is the presidency. It's important to understand that. We understand that, and we also demand nothing from the government. The government has to listen to, and to understand, what the people want," he added.The opposition says he is acting against the will of the people, and has called on Venezuelans to boycott the election.More than 200 people have died in political violence during the past year in Venezuela.Maduro won the election in May, by just 1 percentage point against opposition leader Capriles. He defeated Maduro in 2003.Maduro is a former bus driver, who took over the government one year after Chavez, a former bus driver and union leader, died of a heart attack. Chavez was a socialist politician who became the first democratically elected president of Venezuela.Venezuelan electoral authorities said Tuesday that they will be more transparent, and will ensure that election officials are not involved in any irregularities that may occur during the election."We assure that we will be transparent, that we will be absolutely unbiased. We have made a lot of efforts to avoid that, but we must be careful not to do anything that can cause damage to the electoral process, or the electoral integrity, in its highest level	0
President Barack Obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change, refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point. After the event at Washington's Howard University on Tuesday, Obama sat down with me for a  wide-ranging discussion about the prospects for his proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP).A conversation with President ObamaAfter Obama was elected, I asked him to come on my show to discuss the environment. He responded enthusiastically, which was something I’d been calling for since I first met him.During that appearance on my show, Obama was candid in terms of his concerns about climate change, and he also showed an understanding of our country’s energy needs. The president made clear that he thought we should be doing something about carbon emissions and the threat they pose to our future.I asked him about the Clean Power Plan, the government’s plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants. While I could not share details of that plan, it did come up in the conversation, and Obama answered my questions with candor and transparency.Obama agreed that climate change is a problem requiring urgent attention. He told Fox News that he had been asked to help craft the plan. He said he didn’t intend to do that, but he was happy to do so in terms of getting Congress’ attention."This is something very important to do," he told me. "My administration has committed in the climate-change framework, and I think there should be a real focus on what steps we can take to cut carbon pollution from power plants."Obama told me he does not support the use of carbon-capture technology to offset greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.The president also acknowledged that we could not solve the climate-change problem through regulation alone. "This is not just a bunch of government rules and people trying to do something about carbon pollution," he said to me. "We have to figure out some smart solutions to it. But this is absolutely not the solution."How the Clean Power Plan affects climate changeIf the CPP is approved, it would cut carbon emissions from US power plants by 31% below 2005 levels, which would cut roughly 3,500 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. That’s the equivalent of taking about five years worth of emissions from about every mile of the world	0
Keen, bright-eyed and earnest, the little boy answers the Russian investigator's questions enthusiastically, as if describing a cartoon, not sexual abuse. "He took off my underwear and photographed me," says the victim, whom Russian authorities are not allowing to be identified. The boy goes on to describe sexual abuse at the hands of his own father. Without this testimony, child advocates say, it would be impossible to convict the man, whose trial begins later this year. In Russia, possessing child pornography is not a crime and laws that govern child exploitation are weak. Government authorities say the majority of sexual crimes against children are never reported or investigated. Those are among the reasons that even the Russian government admits the country is a world leader in the production of child pornography. Russian lawmaker Elena Mizulina has been painstakingly shepherding a bill through the country's parliament that would finally protect children. "For the first time people will be held criminally responsible for storing child pornography even if they don't distribute it. To this day, you can't punish anyone for that" in Russia, Mizulina said. The bill has now passed its second of three readings in Russia's State Duma, the lower house of the legislature. The law can't come soon enough for victims. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, more than 800 cases of sexual abuse were reported in the first three months of this year, an increase of 13%. "Analysis of such crimes indicates that sexual assaults against the integrity of minors and their rights and freedoms is mostly stemming from the lack of control by parents, guardians, as well as officials of educational institutions and local government officials," said Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee. Yet even with stronger laws, it is the testimony of young children that will ultimately bring punishment to those who prey on children. Yevgeny Tsymbal, director of a Children's Psychology Center in Moscow, told CNN that weak laws and lack of evidence usually help the abusers avoid detection and punishment. "These crimes usually go on for a long time," he said, adding that because physical signs of abuse are often not apparent, "these crimes are very rarely discovered." The Internet is also a haven for child pornographers in Russia. This week, the Kremlin's child advocate, Pavel Astakhov, spoke in favor of a more stringent policy to force Internet providers to take responsibility for child pornography sites hosted on their servers and social networks.	1
Dori J. Maynard, who as president of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education was dedicated to expanding diversity in newsrooms and excellence in journalism, died Tuesday, according to a statement on the institute's website. She was 79.Maynard was president of the institute from 2007 to 2016.Maynard started in journalism in the late 1960s, first at newspapers in San Francisco and Detroit and later at The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Cleveland Plain Dealer.A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, where she earned a bachelor's degree in journalism, Maynard began her career at the San Francisco Chronicle and The Oakland Tribune, where she was a general assignment reporter. In 1974, she was promoted to city hall reporter and city editor."She was the city editor in the years when the city was so hard-pressed," said Peter Moskos, a former San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. "She was a reporter's reporter, but she also was an editor's editor. She was the reporter who was good in both the city and the region and did both jobs right."She was a leader at the Chronicle in hiring women in journalism and in keeping ethnic and minority journalists, Moskos said, as well as keeping up with other newsrooms."She was a pioneer in San Francisco," Moskos said. "I think she was the first female senior business reporter there was; she was the first female reporter to do a first-day feature piece on the Oakland Tribune.""She was the best reporter I ever worked for," Moskos said. "I had seen her for years. I had heard all about her. She's not a flashy woman. She's quiet and she's humble."Maynard was named The Philadelphia Inquirer's first woman editor-publisher in 1988 and worked for several years in that position. She was also the first president of the association of female business and professional editors of the Chronicle. In 1992, she became the Chronicle's director of new business.In 1988, she became the first woman executive editor of a major daily newspaper in the United States as executive editor of Cleveland's The Plain Dealer."When The Plain Dealer did the story on the first black female business editor, she was the person who put out the call, "She was right on it," said Maynard. "I was absolutely right on it	0
In a city as big as New York, finding long-lost loved ones is no easy task -- especially after they've died. For Elaine Joseph, it took decades. During a massive blizzard in 1978, doctors tried to save her newborn daughter, who was suffering from what turned out to be a fatal heart condition. Joseph, who was still recovering from giving birth at the city's Beth Israel Medical Center, said hospital officials notified her of her baby's death and had her sign off on a city burial. "It was a nightmare," said Joseph, who was then 23 years old and later found it nearly impossible to find where her daughter's remains were buried. "For years and years, I didn't even know where to look," she said. "I didn't know what to do." Joseph didn't get answers until much later, when she met a woman named Melinda Hunt of Westchester, New York. Hunt, 53, has made it her life's work to document the undocumented at Hart Island, reportedly the nation's largest taxpayer-funded potter's field -- a term used for a place where the unclaimed dead are buried. The site, located at the western end of Long Island Sound, dates to the mid-1860s, when it was used as a Union training camp during the American Civil War and then as a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers. But today, its use as a public burial ground isn't always common knowledge -- even to the families of those entombed there. And observers say keeping track of the island's current inhabitants remains a challenge. Joseph said she first found Hunt by happenstance during an Internet search, a part of her unending attempt to locate her daughter's remains. "For 33 years, I've been trying to find where my child is," said Joseph, who said her baby's official burial records were missing. Joseph contacted Hunt through her website at hartisland.net -- a resource Hunt created for family and friends in search of lost loved ones, as well as a nod of acknowledgment to the city's unclaimed dead. Hunt suspected Joseph's child was buried on Hart Island despite the incomplete records. She worked on Joseph's behalf, contacting city officials who eventually granted Joseph access to the island. Though it remains uncertain whether her daughter is buried there, it appears very likely.	1
and no other place reflects this more directly than in the world of tech startups. "If you look at Vietnam or Cambodia or Myanmar, they don't suffer from the ills of the west but they're also very vulnerable," says Chris Young, founding director of research at the London School of Economics' new Venture Capital Fund. The fund has invested in just under $100m of ventures in seven countries between them, mainly in Southeast Asian countries with a population of only a bit over a billion people. Young says the fund is an attempt to reverse the trend of funding going to western countries. "Our aim has always been to invest in the best local people that are trying to do things that nobody else can," he says. "We want to make sure that not only do we invest in the west, we want to ensure that we also invest in the other regions where people aren't quite as well endowed as we are."The fund has seen a lot of success in Vietnam. Its first investment, in 2009, was in a company that turned down $500m in funding from Google: Vinux Technology. Vinux was then bought out three years later by the US giant for $4.9bn. The fund also invested in Uber in 2017, and has invested in other established global technology giants such as Google in China and Airbnb and Facebook in the US.The fund also has an eye on the developing world, where the US and global investors have not invested too heavily. "The thing that I think is so important in investment is to recognise that in our own backyard there are so many people who don't have any money who are trying to get on just a few years later without any money at all," he says. "That's the great thing about investing globally. That's why when you invest globally you have the opportunity to provide for people who need a roof over their head, they don't need a job, they don't need money, they don't need a university degree, they don't need a passport. The fact that they're trying to get a job is a by-product of their skills."What is interesting about this is that the US and other developed economies have not been interested in investing in these countries until now because they realise they have lots of people without money and are in desperate need. But now they're seeing that the same thing is happening in developing countries and they want to address it. "It's definitely a global phenomenon	0

The longest-running holiday special still has a very shiny nose. "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" premiered on television December 6, 1964, and is now one of the holiday season's perennial favorites. The story of  Rudolph's red nose and his wishful quest to find his long-lost brother has been filmed a half-dozen times. A movie version, "White Christmas," appeared in 1965 and a stage musical followed in 1966.Since then, Rudolph has graced the silver screen in films such as "The Santa Clause" (1989), in which he's replaced by his brother, the fat reindeer. Two animated adaptations followed: "Rudolph's Shiny New Year," which aired on ABC in 1994, and "A Christmas Carol" (2008), in which Rudolph, now played by Christian Bale, is a greedy, greedy elf who wishes he'd been better of a brother to his red-nosed buddy.That's the way it works when two movies hit the same holiday spot at the same time. Two Christmas specials that aired nearly 60 years apart."Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is a family-friendly, PG-rated, 3-D movie, and it's about the same time as the second-highest-grossing movie of all-time. The first movie, "White Christmas," comes in second, grossing $1.9 billion, behind only the record-breaker "Avatar." The third one, "A Christmas Story," is the top movie for kids and families."Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," starring Robin Williams (itself one of the most memorable characters ever, and a great way to start a Christmas special) in his first turn as the "reindeer" for a live show, was broadcast on ABC on December 6, 1964, and was only the second movie adaptation on television. It tells the story of a young boy named Rudolph who is given the red nose by his mother and wants it back after her death."Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" begins with a montage of his childhood and a dream he has about finding his long-lost brother. The film, which was based on the "Narnia" books and stories by C.S. Lewis, is about a little boy named Rudolph who loves to read and build	0
A Dutch documentary about a mentally ill and potentially dangerous 18-year-old has prompted lawmakers in the Netherlands -- amid national outrage -- to re-examine the treatment of those in psychiatric care. The documentary, which was produced by the Lutheran-run Evangelical Broadcasting Company and aired on public television Tuesday, followed Brandon van Ingen, a patient at a mental hospital in Ermelo. Since 2007, van Ingen has spent part of his days tethered to a wall due to the danger he poses to others, according to State Secretary for Public Health Marlies Veldhuijzen van Zanten-Hyllner. "Brandon's issue is so serious that he must be restricted in his freedom for the sake of his own safety and that of others," van Zanten-Hyllner wrote in a letter to parliament. "Because of this, Brandon consistently makes use of a band that he fastens himself when he is in the presence of his attendants and other visitors. Whenever there is no one present and at night, the band is loosened." In response to the documentary, the country's political parties held emergency meetings Wednesday to discuss care for the mentally ill. Van Zanten-Hyllner addressed those meetings, explaining that van Ingen's care was in line with rules for restraining mental health patients, but promised to examine whether a change is needed. "The broadcast stirred me deeply," she wrote in the letter to parliament. "It is upsetting to see that such a young person, who has his life before him, has so little perspective for a better future." Van Zanten-Hyllner noted that van Ingen, who apparently hears voices that tell him to do "bad and dangerous things," has his own apartment where he can move about freely. The hospital is working on alternatives for van Ingen's care, van Zanten-Hyllner wrote, "and is undertaking constant efforts to improve the living situation." The program "Outspoken" learned about Van Ingen's story from one of his caretakers at the hospital. "I could no longer do these shifts," Iris Mourits said on the program. "Back-up shifts were OK, but being together with him in a room -- I think at some point he could sense that from the depths of my toes I could no longer see him on that leash." Van Ingen's mother compared his care to that of a "caged animal."	1
City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked Â a visit to Ground Zero on 9/11/01, when hundreds of thousands rushed to the Twin Towers to help those who survived the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The request was denied by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who said Ahmadinejad was only welcome if he is willing to meet with the families of the victims.A former New York City school teacher is behind bars after she told authorities that she helped teach pupils who committed acts of terrorism while she taught at a Manhattan school.

Syrian soldiers working to retake a rebellious northern town killed, wounded and arrested members of "armed terrorist groups" operating in the region, state media reported Saturday. This development unfolded as Syrian troops on Friday afternoon came to the entrances of the city, Jisr Al-Shugur, in an operation "to restore security and tranquility to the area which was being terrorized by armed terrorist groups," the Syrian Arab News Agency reported. This military offensive took place amid anti-government protests raging across Syria for nearly three months, outpourings that have led to violent security crackdowns on demonstrators. Syria's Bashar al-Assad regime has consistently blamed what it calls armed gangs for the bloodshed over the last three months. But activists and protesters say security forces have caused the violence. The Syrian government announced it would punish Jisr Al-Shugur after it accused "armed groups" of killing at least 120 security forces there several days ago. Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey disputed that claim, saying some of the soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves. The military advance spread panic throughout the civilian population, and residents said they had evacuated women and children from Jisr Al-Shugur in recent days. More than 3,800 Syrians have fled to Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported. In the nearby town of Maaret al-Nouman on Friday, Syrian security forces and helicopters advancing toward Jisr Al-Shugur sprayed automatic weapons fire into a crowd of thousands of protesters demonstrating after Friday prayers. As the army reached Jisr Al-Shugur, it "arrested a large number of the armed terrorist group members and killed and wounded a number of them, despite the fact that these groups resorted to setting up traps using dynamites stolen from Wadi Abyad dam area," SANA reported, citing Syrian TV. The military confiscated machine guns, explosive devices, detonators and Turkish SIM cards from those arrested, state TV reported on Saturday. "Cameramen and reporters" were ambushed at the entrance of Jisr Al-Shugur "after they came under heavy fire by the terrorist armed gangs." It said the journalists were doing well and there were no casualties.	1
In the 100 years since British army officer T.E. Lawrence traversed Jordan's desert and the half century since David Lean set out to capture it for his cinematic epic "Lawrence of Arabia," the blood red landscape  has continued to tantalise and amaze audiences around the globe.The beauty is in the detail; the depth of the colours, the ruggedness of the terrain and the rich diversity of the wildlife, which range from gazelles and vultures to camels and ostriches.Here are some of the top spots in Jordan that will have you dreaming of the desert for the next week.1. Ruwaidhbiyah (Lake Qarafa)The largest lake in the Middle East, Ruwaidhbiyah is located in the western part of Jordan. A series of small rivulets run through the lake, making it an ideal spot for swimming, fishing and bird-watching.2. Al-AhsaThe first settlement on the Jordan River, Al-Ahsa is made up of the ruins of ancient tombs and temples.3. Wadi RumThe most photographed site in Jordan is Wadi Rum, a lush oasis located at the mouth of the Red Sea. It is surrounded by hills, with a series of water-holes and cliffs. It was here that British explorer George Mallory took refuge during his ill-fated attempt to find the source of the Nile.4. PetraThe largest archaeological site in the Middle East, Petra is the burial mound for Pharaoh Pethau, who reignited Petra with a statue of a nude woman, the "Nude of the Desert", in the middle of the 10-acre site, in AD 281.5. MasadaMasada was a fortified Jewish settlement on the Judean Desert during the second century AD. In AD 70, Jewish historian Flavius Josephus wrote of the defeat of the Jewish garrison by Roman forces. During the third century the Romans laid siege to the settlement, which was abandoned in AD 132.6. PetraThe Roman ruins at Petra, built between AD 125 and 160, were part of the Nabataean kingdom, which extended as far as what is now Jordan. A Roman era inscription at the site tells of the use of iron to create a bridge at what was the entrance of the fortress	0
In February 2009, President Barack Obama gave this stern warning to bailed-out banks: "You are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you've paid taxpayers back," Obama said at  the White House. "You've got to pay your shareholders back. You've got to pay your bondholders back. You've got to pay yourselves back." Obama's remarks came a few months after a $700 million bonus was announced for Citigroup Chairman Charles "Chuck" Prince and his deputy, Mary Suhm, following Citigroup's successful merger of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. Other members of the executive team saw their bonuses slashed by the Justice Department as a result of the government bailout. On Wednesday, Obama ordered that all bank executives returning from overseas must pay back $20,000 each to the Treasury Department. The order, which was issued by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, followed a request by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.The $20,000 penalty will cost an average CEO $150,000 to meet. Yet the penalty is not a hard line to a bank's creditors: The first $100,000 of a CEO's total compensation is normally tax deductible.A year ago, the European Central Bank (ECB) began charging bank depositors 2.5 percent interest on their savings. This is not a punishment, but a new weapon in the ECB's arsenal during the financial crisis which began in southern Europe in late 2008. The bank is attempting to keep the liquidity in its banks flowing through a new currency, the euro, and not through the bank's depositors' money. The euro is not backed by any government, like the U.S. dollar, nor any central bank, like the U.S. Federal Reserve. Banks do not have to make any large cash deposits to the ECB. The bank will start to make small, regular payments to the ECB in euros to supplement its operations.The central bank will now be able to put up with the loss of some deposits in banks, but not the loss of the money itself. The bank doesn't take deposits into the banking system. Instead, it creates money for banks to take out of their bank accounts. The ECB's 2.5 percent rate is higher than the rates of the European Central Bank's previous rate of interest on various types of loans that were available to members of the ECB's banking system at the time. The new rate will be used	0
Four people were killed and two were wounded when a so-called sticky bomb attached to a vehicle exploded Wednesday evening in the Ashhabi neighborhood of eastern Falluja, local police told CNN. The fatalities -- three Interior Ministry officials and a child -- included the director of the Falluja police intelligence department, the deputy police chief of the Garma police station, the police commissioner and a 7-year-old boy, police said. The wounded included a 5-year-old boy and a police official, police said. The children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern Falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said. Iraqi security forces in Falluja were investigating the incident. The report of the blast came after bombings in three Iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told CNN. In one, a colonel was driving from his home in Kirkuk to the town of Dibia, where he served as police commander. Dibia is about 12 miles north of Kirkuk, which is in the country's north. There has been longstanding sectarian tension among Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen people in Kirkuk. The colonel was Kurdish, but there was no immediate information on whether the bombing was tied to ethnic hostilities. Over a two-hour period in and around the capital, Baghdad, on Wednesday, three attacks wounded several people, police said. Attackers shot and critically wounded a police colonel while he was driving near Shaab stadium in the east. Five people were wounded in a roadside bombing north of the city in Taji. And a police commissioner was wounded when a sticky bomb attached to his car exploded. On Tuesday night, three people were killed in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in the southwestern Saydiya neighborhood. City police said 15 others were wounded. In Ramadi, more than 60 miles west of Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol, and one police officer died.  Ramadi is in the predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province, an area engulfed by violence during the height of the Iraq war. This came after a bloody Sunday, when 17 bombs exploded across Baghdad, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 80, Iraqi authorities said. The attacks were the latest in a spate in recent weeks that have raised concerns about Iraq's ability to protect itself.	1
During 15 years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying, Laurie Halse Anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys: Why was the main character in her book, "Speak," so upset about what happened to her? Didn't she want the attention of one of the popular boys? And why was the impact so traumatic? Anderson, who published the award-winning novel in 1999, believes the questions come from an honest place. They're teen boys, after all, growing up in a society where media and pop culture tell them women are created for sexual gratification. They're not used to reading novels that feature characters like Melinda Sordino, a teen who is raped by a classmate at a house party. As her classmates and neighbors go to great lengths to protect her attacker, Melinda plunges into near-silence, refusing to say what happened while still feeling ostracized by her classmates. Fifteen years after its publication, society has shed some of the stigma associated with sexual violence, but the conflict at the heart of "Speak" still shows up in headlines, from Steubenville, Ohio, to Maryville, Missouri. And yet, many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and intimacy, Anderson said. As a mother who raised four girls, Anderson knows that parents today are navigating uncharted territory when it comes to adolescent sexuality, and they're doing it earlier than parents in other generations. Talking to teens about sexuality, intimacy and consent is urgent, she said. "We've fallen down on our responsibility to our children by somehow creating this world where they're surrounded by images of sexuality; and yet, we as adults struggle to talk to kids honestly about sex, the rules of dignity and consent," she said. "So many teens out there are operating in a vacuum, they're operating in adult situations without any adult support or advice." For the 15th anniversary of "Speak," Anderson is lending her support  to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, a resource for survivors of sexual violence. Macmillan, the publisher of "Speak," is matching donations to the organization in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Anderson said she wrote "Speak" based on her own experience of being raped as a teen. She struggled for years to find the words or the courage to express what she'd gone through.	1
A roadside bomb targeted a police patrol in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, killing a civilian bystander Thursday, a police official told CNN. Iraqis survey the damage after car bombs were detonated within minutes of each other in Mosul, July 9. It is the latest in a series of attacks across Iraq that have killed at least 64 people and wounded 167 others over the past two days. The deadliest attack happened earlier in the day when a double suicide bombing killed at least 35 people and wounded 65 others in the city of Tal Afar in Nineveh province, also in northern Iraq. Political tensions have recently increased in the region between Arabs and Kurds. The Tal Afar bombings occurred a day after attacks on mainly Shiite targets in Nineveh province, including a car bomb in a Turkmen area of the provincial capital Mosul, left at least 19 people dead and dozens wounded. U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq's urban centers June 30. The U.S. military had suggested keeping its combat troops in Mosul beyond the withdrawal deadline, but the Iraqi government insisted on making no exceptions for the date set in the security agreement. Also on Thursday morning, at least seven people were killed and 25 wounded when a bomb detonated in a busy marketplace in Sadr City, the vast Shiite slum in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. Bomb blasts from a rigged bicycle a car in two predominantly Shiite neighborhoods of southwestern Baghdad wounded six people, according to the official. In Baghdad's central Karrada district, a roadside bomb targeting a convoy of Iraq's Central Bank governor killed one civilian bystander and wounded five, another Interior Ministry official told CNN. The governor escaped unharmed. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report	1
A lightning strike from a fast-moving storm in the Pacific Ocean on October 9, 1964, killed 16 passengers and crew aboard the California Clipper, which made the first scheduled nonstop flight, nonstop to London, with passengers from the US, Canada, and Europe. This was the last nonstop flight between Europe and the United States, until a modified and still pioneering service, called the Pan Am Clipper, between London's Heathrow Airport and New York's JFK Airport, was inaugurated in 1978. The lightning strike caused a fireball and a firestorm that spread over much of the coast of southern California, reachingfarther than any lightning storms the state has ever experienced before or since. The flash of lightning lasted only 15milliseconds, but it illuminated a huge and very bright fire in Los Angeles that lastedan estimated 15 to 20 seconds. The fire was first sighted by a pilot of an airplane near Chino which saw a strangething on the horizon after the lightning struck. The plane proceeded to circle for an hour, and then circled lower and lower in an attempt to reduce the intensity of the flames. Only after the plane flew for at lengthdid it receive the call to land. Meanwhile, residents in the city of SantaMonica reported seeing small greenfireballs falling from the sky. The pilot, named John Alberich, made a controlled landing, and the passengers, as well as the crew in the plane, were evacuated. The fire destroyed the plane and the people on board, but no deaths were reported. The pilot reported experiencing a shockwhich led him to seek shelter in a nearby canyon. The plane crashed on the next day, with all passengers and crew safely beneath the wreckage.

Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg. The Ukrainian last put his WBC belt up for sale in July, when he defeated Amir Khan and unified the belts with a decisive points win that propelled him into an unprecedented world title shot. The fight will be broadcast live from Berlin, Germany on HBO. "My plan was always fight on home soil, and Hamburg is a very important home to me," says the champ. "Of course, it's not the first time I will defend the belt. But now I can finally make my statement. "Shannon is a great opponent and I want to finish our fight on a big stage," Klitschko says on his official website. "Shannon is the man who knows how to fight. He is very fit and I want to show that I'm ready for the big stages, too. I want to show him that I can win in a variety of different forms. No one will be at a disadvantage to make the best of our fight." Briggs has been calling Klitschko out for the title. "He has proven that he is the best in the world," Briggs says. "He has not lost a fight since I dropped him. He has not won a fight since I dropped him either. He's a great champion, who is not afraid to fight the big men and I am not afraid to fight him. I want to come out with my best shot and we'll see which man is going to show up and beat the other one." Klitschko, who has never been beaten on his HBO debut, is currently riding a three-month boxing comeback, where he spent 15 weeks recovering from his brutal knockout loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in September of last year. He says he has not lost a fight since he dropped Mayweather in the head on May 2. Briggs, who was knocked out by Klitschko in the first round of their most recent fight, says he is ready to return to action and is happy to be fighting in Klitschko's adopted hometown. He says: "I was born in Hamburg and it is where I'm going to have my fight. I'm very happy to be fighting in Hamburg. It's going to the place I have called home, which is	0
After years spent fighting in some of the world's worst wars, former U.S. Navy SEAL Kristin Beck says she knows what she wants. "I want to have my life," she told CNN's "AC360." "I fought for 20 years for my country, so I've seen a lot. I know that my country needs me to rebuild it asit was. And I'm here to do it. I want to do it."Beck, who was named a Navy SEAL in 2003, has been living in Colorado for the past six years, and she says she feels good about where she's at. However, she has no idea where her life is going to go from here. "I don't know what's going to happen to me," she said."We'll see," Kristin said. But she did say that she wants to "spend my life doing something great."What does she do?It's been four years since Kristin left the Navy, and she's been struggling with what she should be doing with her life."I'm like a lot of people, I feel like I'm lost," she said. "I don't know how to define myself."Kristin grew up a lot, growing up in Northern California and in Hawaii.She served three years in the U.S. Coast Guard and served on the staff of the Central Intelligence Agency and in the office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense. She wanted to do that, but she was told that, "If you're serious about this [work], then you have to go into the military and get out."Instead, she did this work as an instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy, and then she worked at various high schools and colleges.Eventually, she got her certification as a master gunnery Sergeant on the USS Kitty Hawk.After she finished her stint in the Coast Guard, she went back to school at the University of California, Berkeley, and got a degree in political science. She would like to work on policy changes, and she's starting to do that.Now, Kristin is a civilian, and she says she's just trying to figure out what that means."I've just kind of given up on life," she said.

When trouble strikes in our personal lives and we are searching for a source, it usually makes sense to take a look in a familiar place -- the mirror. And so it should be in our troubled politics today. Many of us are deeply angry at politicians in Washington and the broken government they have created. We tend to look down upon them as jackasses and ideologues who are incapable of organizing a two-car funeral. We blame special interests for capturing them, a 24/7 media for encouraging them, and power for corrupting them. Indeed, a list of reasons for broken government could -- and will -- fill a week of columns. But perhaps we give too little attention to the basic notion that our politicians are also a reflection of the public they represent. As the old saying goes, we get the president we deserve -- and usually the Congress, too. In truth, our fractured politics are due in no small part to a fractured country -- one in which consensus and moderation are disappearing. With apologies to President Truman: the buck stops here. Those of us who are older -- born somewhere close to midcentury -- grew up in an America where there was a general consensus that the United States was a great nation, that you could be a success if you worked hard and played by the rules, that government had a positive role to play when trouble hit, and that politics must stop at the water's edge as we united against dangerous enemies. But with Vietnam, the tumult of the '60s and '70s, Watergate and more, our sense of common purpose began collapsing. Listen for a moment to three of the smartest observers in the country who have weighed in this week on the collapse. In this week's New York Magazine, columnist Frank Rich argues that by the late 1960s, "the bipartisan national consensus over the central role of government -- which had held firm through the Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- was kaput. The Reagan revolution was in the wings."	1
Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides. Meanwhile, as much as 10 feet of additional snow is on tap for the __________ region. The mountains are buried now with more than 20 inches of snow after more than a foot on the ground Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. An unusually warm air mass moving in from the West has combined with the cold air mass to give parts of Southern California and the mountains below a sudden burst of snow. A weather model simulation indicates that the weather will remain in the 50s and lower 60s throughout Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.A snowstorm warning for Los Angeles and Ventura on Tuesday was lifted after a warmup brought partly cloudy skies, warm winds and a high near 86 degrees in Santa Barbara. The forecast remains dry with a 30 percent chance of rain.A snowstorm warning for the Los Angeles area was issued as rain fell steadily and the weather was expected to continue to improve Tuesday night into Wednesday morning with a mix of rain with a 20 percent chance, according to weather experts.The weather is expected to break up Wednesday with showers or thunderstorms in the morning, a chance of rain during the afternoon, and a 20 percent chance of rain after 1 p.m.A winter storm warning was issued for parts of Southern California as the first system of the winter began moving through.The storms are causing flooding and road closures in Los Angeles County.“There’s no road closures, but there’s some flooding on the south side of Ventura,” said Mike D’Anniballe, a reporter with the Santa Barbara Independent. “We’ve had multiple downed power lines from the snow, and now we’re getting some water flowing, and that’s a concern.”Snow is also impacting flights out of Orange County but the airport said they had no reports of cancellations at this time.Buses are being held at two locations Monday morning in Los Angeles County because of snow and ice conditions.“We’re waiting out the storm, but it looks like it’s going to be a couple of more hours at this point,” D’Anniballe said.There’s also concerns about	0

In a war of this scale, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we cannot expect lasting success. Our presence in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the global war on organized crime and the global drug trade is bound to eventually result in the collapse of governments that are unable to control the criminal networks and the criminal markets that generate this violence.

Emergency operators get lots of crazy calls, but few start like this. Caller:  "Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane." Operator:  "You're where?" Caller:  "I'm inside a plane  on the ground, I'm trapped. I don't know what happened. My cell phone broke, it's dead, I can't get out. Can you help me? I can't breathe in here. I need a doctor.

Osiel Cardenas Guillen, the former head of a powerful Mexican drug cartel, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and will forfeit to the United States $50 million in illegal proceeds, a judge ruled. Cardenas Guillen, 42, was the leader of the Matamoros, Mexico-based Gulf cartel until his capture in 2003. He was subsequently extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in 2007. U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle handed down the sentence Wednesday, following an earlier guilty plea by the drug kingpin. Under Cardenas Guillen's leadership, the Gulf cartel was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States, the FBI said in a news release. Read the original indictment According to the FBI, in 1999 Cardenas Guillen threatened to kill a U.S. undercover sheriff's deputy. In another incident, he threatened the lives of two U.S. agents. "The successful prosecution of Cardenas Guillen underscores the joint resolve of the United States and Mexico to pursue and prosecute the leadership of the drug trafficking cartels, dismantle their organizations and end the violence and corruption they have spawned," U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said. Cardenas Guillen pleaded guilty to five felony charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, conspiracy to launder money and threatening to assault and kill federal agents. Tagle also fined Cardenas Guillen $100,000 and ordered him to five years probation once his sentence is served. He is not eligible for parole.	1
An al Qaeda-linked rebel group has wrested control of the historic Christian town of Maaloula from regime forces, opposition groups said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the hardline Islamist rebels of the al-Nusra Front seized control Saturday night. Videos posted on YouTube in recent days showed fighting between rebels and government forces in the tiny sleepy town, an hour's drive from the capital Damascus. "We cleansed Maaloula from all the Assad dogs and all his thugs," a rebel commander shouts at the camera in a video posted online over the weekend. What the capture will mean for the Christian residents waits to be seen. As the 18-month-long Syrian conflict festers, the government and the opposition welcome and need Christian support. But some Christians fear radical Islamists have been swelling rebel ranks. They also fear the same fate as a number of Christians during the war in Iraq, where militants targeted them and spurred many to leave the country. Christians make up roughly 10% of the population. Syria is ruled by a government dominated by Alawites, whose faith is an offshoot of Shiism. The regime is opposed by an opposition with a large Sunni presence. Aid agencies say Syria's 2 million Christians are often targeted for suspected sympathies to President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Two top bishops have been kidnapped; a well-known priest is missing. Antoinette Nassrallah, the Christian owner of a cafe in Maaloula, told CNN last year she had seen government TV images depicting radical Muslim attacks on Christians. She said she has heard about such violence in Aleppo. "For now in our area here it's fine," she said last year. "But what I heard, in Aleppo, they are killing, destroying many of churches -- very, very old churches." Many of Syria's Christians have fled to Lebanon where they shelter in monasteries. On Saturday, they joined in prayers for peace promoted by Pope Francis in Rome. Last year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on leaders of  al-Nusra while the State Department blacklisted it as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. But Washington accuses the group of using the Syrian conflict to advance its own ideology and ends.	1
The economy in southern New Hampshire is not by any means among the worst in the nation. Still, according to city records, there are 29 foreclosed homes on the books in Nashua -- many of which are in deplorable condition. Walls had iced over, windows were broken or blocked by plywood or metal siding; lawns are littered with junked furniture and appliances.As it happens, the city of Nashua is in the midst of a foreclosure war, one of the state's largest ever, with hundreds of homes and apartment buildings in the midst of potential foreclosure.In 2003, the city's Department of Community Affairs started an aggressive foreclosure prevention program with the help of former HUD secretary and New Hampshire businessman and philanthropist Andrew Cuomo. The city worked out a deal with Cuomo to buy the properties from private investors, including a $8.5 million loan from the city to buy the four most foreclosed properties in the city (a fifth has since been sold).To date, the city has purchased and closed on more than 1,800 foreclosed properties. This year, the city plans to close on approximately 1,600 foreclosed properties with the help of a $5 million federal grant. The city will partner with nonprofit National Organization of Realtors in an effort to close on all of the approximately 800 foreclosed properties in the city, which are owned by investors that cannot afford to refinance their mortgages.In the same city, there are over 150 houses built at one time but now sitting unoccupied, abandoned or waiting for foreclosure. Those houses have been abandoned for many reasons, including too much money in the bank.Despite the foreclosures, the economy here looks strong, with job growth on the rise.The foreclosures and abandoned houses are a problem, but in a city where the population is less than 400,000, most of the foreclosures won't really change the economic dynamics of the city.For example, in a city like Nashua, it may be hard to see the foreclosure problem as a major development. Still, in a city the size of Nashua, the number of foreclosures could seriously hurt the city's economy -- potentially cutting it in half.In Nashua, the foreclosed homes are usually the homes where the parents of high school seniors, married couple's in their 20s and young families have	0

His fourth consecutive victory came despite failing to complete a lap after having spun on the first lap, and his performance was down to "a very, very strong race car." Speaking after the race, Vettel said that his recent form had "been fantastic" and that he could not have imagined he would make history with his drive in Abu Dhabi.

With President Barack Obama's approval rating hovering in the low to mid-40s -- it was 45% in CNN/ORC International's recent poll --Democrats in tough contests are largely keeping their distance from the president's tarnished reputation. And as Election Day has drawn closer, those differences have become more pronounced. Republican opponents are trying harder than ever to link their rivals to the president, forcing Democrats to visibly distinguish themselves from the White House. Here are seven Democratic candidates who've kept Obama on the sidelines: 1. Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky. As the Democrat challenging the Senate's top Republican in a state that voted for Mitt Romney two years ago, Grimes has been perhaps the most high-profile candidate to keep her distance from Obama. Most notably, she refuses to say whether she voted for the president, citing a matter of principle of privacy at the ballot box as her reason for not answering the question. She's been pressed about her support for the president because she's made a blatant attempt to paint herself as the Democratic antithesis to the commander in chief. "I'm not Barack Obama," she said in a campaign ad. "I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA." 2. Sen. Mark Begich, Alaska. Only 41% of Alaska voters sided with Obama in 2012, so Begich knows all too well that it's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president. In fact, he likes to think of himself more as a "thorn." "I'll be a thorn in his [posterior]," Begich told the Washington Post. "There's times when I'm a total thorn, you know, and he doesn't appreciate it." Last week he admitted he voted for Obama but argued that his voting record was irrelevant because "the president's not relevant" and will be "gone in two years." A limited role for Obama in his final campaign And earlier this year he told CNN that he doesn't need Obama to campaign for him in Alaska. "I need him to change some of his policies." Regardless of how big of a thorn he is, Begich has a tough hill to climb to win a second term. He barely squeaked out a win in 2008 over then-longtime Sen. Ted Stevens, who at the time was buried in an ethics scandal. And a CNN/ORC poll from early October had Sullivan leading Begich, 50% to 44%.	1
Former British pop star Gary Glitter was arrested Thursday and charged with committing eight sex offenses against two teenage girls more than three decades ago. Glitter, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was known as a "glam rocker" in the 1970s for his flamboyant clothes and performing style. He sold 18 million records with hits like "I'm the Leader of the Gang," "I Love You Love Me Love" and "Rock 'n' Roll." He was charged with six counts of indecent assault, one count of administering a drug to facilitate sexual intercourse and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under age 13, the Crown Prosecution Office said. The offenses happened between 1977 and 1980 when the girls were 12 to 14 years old, the Crown Prosecution Office said. There was not sufficient evidence to prosecute five allegations made by two other complainants, authorities said. Glitter is scheduled to appear June 19 in court. Glitter has been prosecuted previously on sex charges. In 1999 he admitted possessing child pornography and was jailed for four months. While living in Vietnam he was convicted of sex offenses against young girls and jailed nearly three years before being deported to England. Another British pop culture figure was accused of sex crimes in recent years. In 2012, women came forward to allege television disc jockey and television star Jimmy Savile had sexually molested them decades earlier when they were in their mid-teens. Savile died in 2011 at age 84. CNN's Lorenza Brascia contributed to this report.	1
Russian authorities are investigating the recent killing of a model-turned-bodyguard. Anna Loginova in a photo shoot for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine. Anna Loginova, a 29-year-old японский художник, was shot dead by a man described as a gang member of Russian President Vladimir Putin's. The model, who was posing next to her bodyguard in the first issue of Maxim, published in Russia, has been named as Anna Loginova. The crime is said to have taken place on May 29, 2014, while Loginova was in Saint-Petersburg to attend the opening of the Saint Petersburg International Children's Library, where she had designed an art installation to accompany the occasion. After the opening, the art installation was to be presented in the presence of Putin.In an interview with the Associated Press, Russian police chief Yury Khinchuk said that "the investigation so far has nothing to do with political issues. This murder has nothing to do with terrorism or drug trafficking." The police have announced that the victim and her private bodyguard have been identified as Alexander Sukhorukov, who has a history of drug abuse, and Yurii Marchenko, 28, of Chechen heritage who is a professional bodyguard.Sukhorukov was arrested on November 13th, in connection with the death of a Russian businessman in Moscow at the hands of a gang linked to the Ural Regional State Government. The businessman was later found to be not only shot by two assassins hired by Sukhorukov, but also beheaded and dismembered. The police have said that Sukhorukov, a bodyguard, had been hired by the businessman to protect him at the time of the murder. The Ural Regional Governor has stated that the killer was a man of Chechen origin and a member of a gang under the leadership of Sukhorukov, who was allegedly responsible for the murder of an unidentified businessman in Moscow. Sukhorukov has also been described as an "international drug dealer".The police have also stated in the press release announcing the arrest of the businessman's killers, that the businessman was killed on May 4th on the outskirts of Krasnoarmeiskoye village, which is in the Vyshnevolokhsky District of Moscow.

The mysterious visitor stands in a patch of scrubland in Somalia, surrounded by Islamic militants wielding AK-47s. His face is covered by a white-and-red headscarf; he is slim and seems young. But  his head is bare, and the black eyes under a thick black mask are sharp."We do not believe in miracles," says the man from an Islamic extremist group. "That is why we do the rituals. We kill and we burn."For some of the people in this remote corner of Somalia, the world's largest famine has become a religious war. They live mostly on subsistence farming and cattle-herding -- or as they are known in this arid country, "feast and famine."A month after heavy rains sent a flood of refugees to the capital of Mogadishu, the world media is still struggling to know what's happening on the ground.As hundreds die every month, most of them children, the world's attention is focused on the United Nations' humanitarian agencies and the European Union. But there is another, darker side to Somalia's devastating famine.The world's second-worst famine in more than a decade has triggered a civil war between radical Islamic militants and a coalition of nomadic warlords, clan elders and other rural residents, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands on both sides.The militants view themselves as the defenders of a peaceful and independent Islamic state, but the clan elders view them as invaders who have seized their land and destroyed their heritage.A child wearing a white hijab sits next to a man wearing the red and white Islamic militant group of Al-Shabab symbol. Both are in the middle of a battle near the town of Bardhere in Somalia.

Michael Schumacher has been one of Pirelli's biggest critics this season, but Formula One's tire supplier has backed the seven-time world champion to end his long wait for a victory at Sunday's European Grand Prix. The 43-year-old, who has not finished on the podium since coming out of retirement in 2010, told CNN that dealing with the rapidly degrading rubber this year was like "driving on raw eggs." He has been outshone by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery believes the German can perform well in Valencia, where he has failed to make the top-10 in two previous attempts. Schumacher did, however, top the qualifying times at another street circuit last month in Monaco, but started the race sixth due to a penalty and ended up retiring early -- as he did last time out in Canada. "I think you have to look at someone like, maybe Michael, getting the pole position," Hembery told F1's official website. "He probably would have won Monaco if he hadn't been penalized, so why not here? Michael for Valencia, that's where the money should go." Sauber chief: "F1 better than ever" Schumacher, who won 91 grands prix between 1992 and 2006, was penalized in Monte Carlo due to a collision with Bruno Senna at the Spanish Grand Prix. The former Ferrari driver has endured a miserable start to the 2012 season, collecting just two world championship points and retiring from five of the first seven races. Rosberg, meanwhile, is fifth on 67 points and clinched the first race win of his career in China. But Schumacher, who has won the European Grand Prix a record six times at its former homes in Jerez and Nurburgring, is confident Mercedes can overcome the reliability issues which have dogged him. "Our motto in the last few days has been to roll our sleeves up and focus on the job in hand," he said. "Everybody in the team has taken that approach to heart, so we can travel to Valencia in an optimistic mood." Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn, who worked with Schumacher at Ferrari, conceded he has not provided him with an adequate car. "The performance of our car and our tire management were generally good in Canada, however our competitiveness was compromised by reliability problems and mistakes," said Brawn.	1
From the steep slopes of volcanic Haleakala to the wealth of surf spots, Maui beckons lovers of sun, sand and surf. But venture just beyond the hotel buffet and discover what a foodie destination the Valley Island has become. Maui's culinary landscape is heavily influenced by fresh, local and 'ono (delicious) flavors. Chefs, farmers, ranchers and fishermen work together toward a sustainable future where island ingredients are the featured attraction on daily menus and reflect the agriculture and people of Maui. The Hawaiian Regional Cuisine movement started in 1991, with 12 founding chefs interested in focusing on using the freshest local ingredients to achieve the diverse flavors of island dishes. Three of those original chefs head restaurants in Maui: Mark Ellman of Mala Ocean Tavern, Beverly Gannon of Hali'imaile General Store and Peter Merriman of Merriman's Kapalua. Those and some of the founding chefs' more recent ventures -- including Ellman's newest, Honu, in Lahaina, Gannon's eponymous Gannon's and Merriman's Monkeypod Kitchen in Wailea -- are among the best places to get a sample of Maui flavor, straight from the farm to the table. Lonley Planet: Hawaii for first-timers: how to choose an island Just like the wealth and diversity of fresh local ingredients, their availability spans beyond large restaurants to smaller establishments. Get a taste of guri-guri, a treat crossed between ice cream and sherbet, at Tasaka Guri Guri. Another sweet option is the island-style ice cream at Roselani Tropics Ice Cream, featuring local flavors such as vanilla, mango, pineapple and coffee. Home Maid Bakery's crispy manju has luscious fillings from azuki beans to coconut. Take some island style home in a bag of Maui coffee. The best place to do your shopping is on a coffee estate, where you can get a look at where your morning beverage comes from, such as MauiGrown Coffee or Kupa'a Farms. Farmers' markets and farm stands have become more than a regular shopping opportunity for locals -- they're now a common stop on a visitor's itinerary as well. Markets are an easy way to showcase Maui's farms and ranches and the food they produce.	1
Patrick Vieira's move to Manchester City appears to have moved a step closer after Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho confirmed he has played his last game for the Italian club.  English Premier League side City  signed the Portuguese midfielder two years ago but Inter's president Massimo Moratti has already informed City that he no longer wants him.  "We have had no dialogue with City Football Group,'' he said, "and, given the circumstances that the club has taken us into, we will not have any further dealings with them.'' Vieira moved to Inter in the summer of 1999 from Benfica where he had fallen foul of Benfica's disciplinarian coach Cesar Emmott before joining the club.  This transfer was criticised by some of Vieira's former teammates in the Portuguese top division, however he quickly made an impression on them and became a fans' favourite as he went on a run of form with Inter, making seven goals and 13 assists in his first season with the club.Vieira's last goal for Inter came in the Champions League against Chelsea in November 2004.  Inter went through two Champions League groups before being knocked out by Manchester United in the last 16.  Vieira scored twice in that match, winning a penalty which led Inter to win the match at Old Trafford.

A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world. Queen Rania says cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities are ways to combat terrorism. Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait. Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded that country in 1990, her family fled and settled in Jordan. After graduating from business school, Rania began working her way up the corporate ladder. When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors. He didn't remain one for long after that night. Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. And, though they planned for a life as royals, Abdullah assumed he'd remain a military officer for life. In 1999, while on his deathbed, King Hussein of Jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son Abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king. That made 29-year-old Rania the world's youngest living queen. Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by. "I am not at all conscious of it," she says. "I make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it. Because I'm Rania, you know? People call me 'Queen,' but, you know, that's not me ... I'm Rania." There are many perks to being queen, of course, but Rania stresses that there are also responsibilities. "One of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that I might be far removed, that I might not be in touch with reality," she says. "The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces. That's something I do on a daily basis."  Watch how Queen Rania uses technology to reach young people » When most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales. "For me, it's just real life," Rania says. "I am a mother. I care about my children. I worry about what they eat. I worry about the influences from their friends."	1
Formal charges are expected against seven Royal Marines who were arrested this week on suspicion of murder involving an urn containing the ashes of a deceased child and the head of a dead snake on a street in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood.The seven men – four Royal Marines and three members of the military police – have been formally accused of murder in the death of an 11-month-old girl in Waverley, in Sydney's north, earlier this month. The Royal Marines deny any charges.The children's father, a man named John Lewis, was reportedly found alive with snake's heads around his neck and an urn containing ashes of a dead child inside his car after his wife's body was discovered in the back seat.The seven men – four Royal Marines and three members of the military police – have been formally accused of murder in the death of an 11-month-old girl in Waverley, in Sydney's north, earlier this month. Credit:APThe six soldiers and three members of the military police are scheduled to make a brief appearance in front of the Supreme Court in Sydney on Tuesday, accused of aiding and abetting the father.During a brief detention hearing by the NSW Supreme Court Justice Michael Allingham on Monday, Crown prosecutor Michael Pang has alleged in his statements that the seven men and one woman “intentionally” placed the child's head in a bottle of water, removed the head and put it in the car.Mr Pang added that the child was “conscious, appeared to have life” when the group drove off, but the child soon died of asphyxiation.An earlier statement by the father of the deceased, who was himself a Royal Marines officer, said he found the mother and child in her car in a “horrible state” and was told the child was unconscious and struggling to breathe.According to a brief statement from the father of the deceased in the Supreme Court on Monday, the child had a “giant hole” in its chest and was not breathing when he tried to take it into a house to call for help.“I was told that the child had died,” he told the court.Mr Pang said the father had no involvement in the death of the child and he had been in a safe house at the time of the alleged murder.	0
The United States is sending an additional $12 million in humanitarian aid to Syria, the White House announced Thursday, warning of a "dire and rapidly deteriorating" situation inside the country. Citing U.N. estimates, the White House said up to 1.5 million Syrians are in need of aid, including more than 130,000 who have fled the country amid a widespread uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Read more about how Obama authorized support for Syrian rebels "With these additional funds, the United States is now providing over $76 million in assistance for food, water, medical supplies, clothing, hygiene kits, and other humanitarian relief to those most urgently in need," the White House said. The statement repeated U.S. calls for al-Assad to step down and "enable a peaceful political transition to a government that is responsive to the aspirations of the Syrian people." The move comes a day after U.S. officials told CNN that President Barack Obama had signed a directive authorizing covert, nonlethal U.S. support for Syrian rebel fighters by the CIA and other agencies. It was unclear exactly what the secret order, referred to as an intelligence "finding," authorized and when it was signed, but the sources said it was within the past several months. Read more: Kofi Annan resigns as envoy to Syria The Obama administration had said it would step up its assistance to the opposition after last month's failure by the U.N. Security Council to agree on tougher sanctions against the Assad regime. But the administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now, providing only nonlethal assistance such as communications equipment. Syrian state TV reacted to American news reporting about the directive, saying Obama has decided to "support terrorists." U.S. officials have told CNN that Washington is cooperating with countries that are arming the rebels, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to help find groups worthy of aid. Diplomatic sources have also said the United States is providing intelligence on Syrian troop movements, which is then passed to rebel groups.	1
The leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, was wounded in a suspected U.S. drone strike Thursday, intelligence and Taliban sources told CNN Friday. A Taliban spokesman denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud  was killed in the strike. Mehsud was being treated for a wound to his head at a hospital in Quetta, where he has been based for several years, according to a senior Afghan intelligence official, who asked not to be named. He said Mehsud had a compound there, and spoke to people as usual and traveled in a private car.U.S. officials in the current administration are reportedly furious with a video that appears to show one of the two U.S. operatives who flew their drone into Pakistan on the night of 11 September. The video, showing the U.S. drone crew in the background, comes from an anti-American cleric who had been arrested in Pakistan two weeks earlier because of "anti-American content". The cleric who released the footage, Fazlur Rahman, was arrested on charges of blasphemy by a court in Quetta. He also filmed himself and two other U.S. personnel being captured, one by a Pakistani gendarme and one by a Taliban fighter. The U.S. responded to the video by claiming that it was a "clear propaganda stunt" to support the anti-Islam film "Innocence of Muslims" that had recently caused an uproar in the West because of its offensive portrayals of the Prophet Muhammad, but the U.S. government said the men are still alive.A senior official at the Pakistan-based Haqqani network that has been carrying out attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan said Saturday that he had shot and killed three U.S. soldiers in an encounter south of Kabul. The shooter, who is said to be in his 20s, was reportedly injured in the attack and could not speak on the radio. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.As U.S. and Afghan forces battle the Taliban in the eastern part of the country, the head of a prominent Afghan Islamist group said he believes the United States will "come to regret" the assassination of Hakimullah Mehsud, the Taliban commander who has been seen as the most powerful man in the insurgency.

Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates, according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country. Vertical births where women are kneeling or crouching and holding on  to their fetuses, known as caesarean sections, are thought to be to blame.There are at least 300,000 caesarean sections carried out every year in Peru, and a higher rate of death than that reported by the WHO. Amnesty said that some 2,500 women died under such operations in 2004."In this country there are so many deaths. They are too many, it is incredible," said Maritza López Barrera, a Peruvian medical student who is participating in the Amnesty International report.The Amnesty International report, "Peru: A national health emergency," says that maternal deaths are rising in Peru, and that caesarean sections are the reason."Maternal deaths are reaching epidemic proportions and caesarean sections are driving their increase. It is an unacceptable practice," said Juan Carlos Romero, an Amnesty International representative based in Peru.The report says that although the country's maternal mortality rate has dropped between 2000 and 2004, it has now reached 8,000 a year, or 200 per day."A caesarean section is a complicated operation that should not be done without anaesthetic. The mother goes under general anaesthesia and this is something the hospital should have a system to make sure they don't do it without anesthesia, because there is a lot of risk involved," said Maritza López Barrera.Amnesty is calling on the government to ban the operation or require anaesthetists to have specific training in how to perform them."They are taking the life of a mother and that's unacceptable. They are not qualified to do it, not for the mother or the baby," said Maritza López Barrera.Although the Peruvians are not the first to study the connection between caesarean section and maternal mortality in Latin America.A 2001 study by the University of Chile's Health Sciences National Committee on Family Health found that the number of caesarean sections performed in Peru was on the rise. The report, "Family care of women in relation to caesarean sections," found that in 2000, 10,000 ca	0
More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on. Relatives carry the coffin of Osman on Saturday after his funeral ceremony in Istanbul. Ertugrul Osman, grandson of Sultan Abdulhamid II and heir to the Ottoman throne, died this week in Istanbul of kidney failure at the age of 97, after having lived most of his life in exile in a humble third-floor walk-up apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Osman's funeral in the garden of the mammoth Sultanahmet Mosque was attended by Turkish state ministers, artists and media glitterati. They lined up to pay their respects to Osman's widow, Zeynep Osman, herself a descendant of the royal family of Afghanistan. One woman pressed her forehead to Mrs. Osman's hand in a traditional Turkish show of respect, saying "I'm just an ordinary person, but I would like to kiss your hand." "His death marks the passing of an era," wrote Jason Goodwin, author of "Lords of the Horizons," which tells the history of the Ottoman Empire, in an e-mail to CNN. "Osman himself was born into a family that still ruled an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indian Ocean. He was named after the founder of his dynasty, who lived seven centuries ago." During annual campaigns at the peak of its power, the Ottoman Sultan's army of Janissaries struck fear into the hearts of European monarchs. For 400 years, the Ottomans declared themselves the "caliphs" -- spiritual leaders -- of the Muslim world. But the empire declined during the 19th century, eventually suffering a humiliating defeat and partition at the hands of Allied armies during World War I. In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship. Two years later, Ataturk banned the caliphate, declaring Turkey a secular state.	1
One man more interested than most in what President Barack Obama will have to say in his address to the nation Wednesday night is al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. In his hideout somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he will likely be hoping that the President sets out a plan to exterminate the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a group that has eclipsed al Qaeda and made al-Zawahiri seem virtually irrelevant. Al-Zawahiri and the core of al Qaeda are locked in battle with ISIS for the leadership of the global jihadist movement -- offering very different visions and strategies. ISIS was expelled from al Qaeda in February after rejecting al-Zawahiri's demand that it restrict its activities to Iraq. ISIS has captured the imagination of a new generation of jihadists -- from Arab and European states alike -- with its ruthless pursuit of a Caliphate, dramatic territorial gains and relentless propaganda machine. Its chilling brutality toward non-Muslims and Muslims who don't share its rigid interpretation of Islam echo the behavior of its predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, whose vicious attacks on Shia Muslims and moderate Sunnis drew the ire of the late al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden. In short, ISIS'  "traipse through Iraq represents a serious organizational, strategic, and ideological blow to al Qaeda," analyst Barak Mendelsohn wrote in Foreign Affairs in June. So far, the leaders of al Qaeda affiliates have remained loyal (if not enthusiastically) to al-Zawahiri. After the death of its leader Ahmad Abdi Godane last week, Al-Shabaab quickly reiterated its allegiance to the al Qaeda leader, and Nasir al Wuhayshi, al Qaeda's No. 2, remains at the helm of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Prominent jihadi preachers like Abu Muhammad al Maqdisi and Abu Qatada have blasted ISIS for deviancy. Appealing to a new generation of jihadists But the younger generation of jihadists appears to be more impressed by action than sermons. Al Qaeda foot-soldiers -- from Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere -- are flocking to ISIS' standard. To them, its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is confronting the apostates and building the Caliphate, while al-Zawahiri talks.	1
Three former journalists at Rupert Murdoch's defunct British tabloid News of the World have pleaded guilty to phone hacking, British media reported Wednesday, citing the prosecution in the case. The three who pleaded guilty are Neville Thurlbeck, James Weatherup and Greg Miskiw. They were among a group of people who went on trial this week in the much-anticipated case. The highest profile defendants are Rebekah Brooks, a protégé of global media baron Murdoch, and Andy Coulson, a former spin doctor for British Prime Minister David Cameron -- both former editors of News of the World. It is not clear how the guilty pleas from the three journalists will affect the cases against their former bosses. The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned  News of the World through its UK subsidiary, News International. Phone hacking scandal: Fast facts After the scandal, Murdoch stepped down from a string of company directorships and abandoned a multibillion-dollar bid to acquire satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney, as well as victims of crime and the July 7, 2005, London terrorist attacks. Brooks and Coulson were close to British Prime Minister David Cameron. Coulson, who edited the News of the World from 2003 to 2007, went on to become Cameron's director of communications before resigning early in 2011. Brooks was a friend of the prime minister and his wife. Brooks, formerly chief executive of News of the World's parent company, News International, part of Murdoch's News Corp. empire, also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice. But the most explosive charge against her is plotting in 2002 to eavesdrop illegally on the voice mail of missing British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. Public anger after the revelation in 2011 that the missing girl's phone had been hacked forced Murdoch to close News of the World, which Brooks edited at the time of the hacking. She then became editor of The Sun newspaper before taking up the chief executive role. Murdoch's News International announces new name	1
Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said. It is at least the fourth violent attack in New York this week, including the killing of an Orthodox Jewish man in an apparent hate crime early Monday, but no arrests have been made.In that case, a man was stabbed repeatedly before being found collapsed on a park bench about 8 a.m. at a popular corner with a popular park. Police responded to a report of a male in distress at about 6 a.m. at a nearby subway station in the East Village, where they discovered a man dead — the victim of a stabbing.At one point, officers spoke with the attacker only briefly in a precinct off West Street and found him to be “not a threat,” police said.The man’s brother, 31, was found to have taken his brother’s wallet, which contained his ID and credit cards, police said after the man’s body was removed from the scene.The NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force is making the investigation public to spur additional anti-discrimination measures in this year’s mid-term election, said Deputy Commissioner William Bratton, who oversaw the unit until November 2015.“We are trying to get some sense of what this is all about. The NYPD is very concerned about this,” Mr. Bratton said. “There was a lot of chatter at the beginning. Now we have to get a sense of what this is, and then make some decisions.”The police investigation is in its earliest stages. No arrests have been made and the man’s motive remains unclear, said the NYPD’s vice president and chief of department, Philip Banks.In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Banks said he had not spoken to the suspect Thursday night because the man was in police custody.“Now we’re on the outside” looking at the attack, Mr. Banks said, adding that the man has “a lot of questions” and “is still under a lot of stress.”The Anti-Defamation League’s regional director of security and operations said anti-Semitic vandalism has increased in the city in recent weeks	0
As a third-grader in Winsted, Connecticut, last year, Matthew Asselin was sick -- a lot. He was lethargic and plagued with a persistent wet cough, respiratory infections and painful headaches. As the school year wound down, ersatz doctors came to his student health center, trying to help his symptoms."They put me on painkillers, and my parents and doctor would have to sit around and help me take them," he recalls. "But it wouldn't do any good."Matthew, who is now 11, was finally given a diagnosis: chronic idiopathic urticaria. The condition causes your skin to become irritated, and it can lead to an allergic reaction if you rub it for more than 30 minutes.It's not a new medical problem, but the latest research on idiopathic urticaria is beginning to change the way the condition is described."In 2004, I would have given this kind of diagnosis [to a patient], but now I'm more confident that it's a diagnosis and there is more to it than just urticaria," says Dr. Joshua Schachter, the lead author of the study and a medical student at Yale University. "We understand the pathophysiology a lot better now and we can treat it more effectively."The new consensus on idiopathic urticaria is that it's an allergic reaction that happens when your immune system over-reacts without an identifiable cause. Urticaria is the medical term for the immediate, allergic reaction that happens when you stick your tongue out and your eyes water. Researchers are learning more about how the immune system becomes over-reactive and how it sends the signals to the head that turn into itching.While studies continue to shed light on what causes the allergic reaction, the new consensus on idiopathic urticaria isn't nearly enough yet. There are still a lot of unknowns, "and we don't know anything about when [it] starts," Schachter says. "Whether it starts in infancy and goes into adulthood, we don't know."In fact, Schachter says that he's noticed a recent upswing in idiopathic urticaria cases, partly because of the recognition that the condition has no identifiable cause."The old way of thinking didn't make sense," he says. "But what's happening now	0
Allow us to take a moment to recognize Wiz Khalifa as the new king of #selfies. According to TMZ, the rapper -- who has a well-documented penchant for toking -- was arrested early Sunday morning at a Texas airport after a "green leafy substance" was found during a security check. But it looked like Wiz, who was born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, wasn't too stressed about the situation as he tweeted a pic of himself in jail with the caption "Jail selfie." Talk about making lemonade out of lemons. He also tweeted a picture of the barred jail door saying "Free Trap Wiz." That cry was quickly picked up by fans on social media who turned it into a hashtag, naturally. MTV reported that he was released after a few hours and charged with being in possession of 0.5 grams of marijuana. He has been cited for simple possession of marijuana in the past, including in 2012 before one of his concerts in North Carolina. The rapper's new project is titled "28 Grams" and is expected to be released soon.	1
Legendary fiddle player Charlie Daniels got a new instrument Thursday -- a pacemaker to help his heart keep the beat. Daniels, 76, found out he needed a pacemaker "to regulate his heart rate" after he checked into a hospital Monday to be treated for "a mild case of pneumonia," his publicist said Thursday. "I just had not been feeling well and wanted to get checked out," Daniels said. "I am thankful the doctors found the problem and were able to implant a pacemaker to get my heart rate regulated. I am feeling so much better and looking forward to spending Easter with my family." The surgery to implant the pacemaker happened in a Nashville area hospital Thursday morning, according to the statement from his publicist. He should be home Friday where he'll rest for two weeks, it said. The Grand Ole Opry star, who may be best known for his 1979 hit "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," will continue touring, which he has done for more than four decades. Performances in New Jersey and Ohio set for next week will be rescheduled, but Daniels plans to be back on stage with his fiddle in Lynchburg, Virginia, on April 11, the statement said.	1
Florida A&M University band director Julian White, who had been under pressure to step aside after the hazing-related death of a band member, is retiring, his attorney announced Thursday. White, 71, is stepping down just ÂÂÂÂ as the school tries to repair the damage inflicted by a fraternity whose "deaths were deemed so excessive by the university that they became the subject of an ongoing public inquiry," the attorney, Scott Cooper, wrote in a statement. White began his tenure as director at A&M, a historically black school in the University System of Florida, in 1992 and "was instrumental in the development of the band, its musicians, and its performances." The school had been mired in controversy and upheaval since freshman Anthony Wilson, a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, died in a 2015 hazing death at a house party.In early February, a Florida police officer was shot while responding to a 911 call. Two days later, the same officer was shot yet another time. Police suspect foul play in both incidents, and as of Wednesday, they have cleared the officer of wrongdoing. It is not clear whether the officer in the February shooting was the same officer as the officer shot on Feb. 17. The officer in the first shooting has been identified as 24-year-old Jeffrey Butler of Winter Haven, and the officer in the second as 21-year-old Brandon Hahn of Orlando.University of South Florida police investigated an incident involving a South Florida student who was allegedly drunk before allegedly attacking a police officer, the school's president said today. Police were notified of the alleged "assault and battery" against Capt. Steve Bevilacqua shortly after midnight on Feb. 14, he said at a news conference. In a statement, USF AD Bob Poynter said the incident occurred when Bevilacqua was working as a part-time security officer for the university's Center for Student Success. "Bevilacqua was working as a security guard who was provided with a gun, but his personal protective equipment was removed," Poynter said. "He then allegedly assaulted a security officer." Bevilacqua, 36, was charged with third-degree assault and battery, said USF spokesman Bryan Garner. Bevilacqua has not been arrested and will not face criminal charges until the internal investigation is complete, Garner said. "Bevilacqua is a professional security officer at USF. There	0
Sometimes when I go I feel ashamed and go back without defecating. Sometimes I wait until dark to go there so no one can see me. I will be very concerned about Diani, my daughter, going to the bush because it is so far from here. At night it is very dangerous. People get killed. A woman and a boy were killed with knives. One woman I know of has been raped." These are the words of Sandimhia Renato, a young mother from Mozambique. She has to walk 15 minutes every day to find somewhere to go to the toilet. Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet. Today, 19 November, is the first U.N. recognized World Toilet Day. It's easy to dismiss such days, but recognition of the need to address this issue is vital. Read this: Happy World Toilet Day Access to a safe toilet is one of the most effective ways of reducing death and disease and improving life for millions. Every hour 70 women and girls will needlessly die from diseases directly linked to a lack of an adequate toilet and safe drinking water. In total one and a quarter million men, women and children will die this year from preventable diseases brought about by a lack of access to these basic services. To die for want of a toilet is an outrage that we should not be tolerating. That is why WaterAid, Unilever and the UN partnership organisation, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council have produced a new report, We Can't Wait, demonstrating the scale and consequences of this problem. Writing in the foreword to the report, UN Deputy Secretary-General, Jan Eliasson, and Unilever chief executive officer, Paul Polman, state: "One person in three lacks access to adequate sanitation. The result is widespread death and disease -- especially among children -- and social marginalization. Women are particularly vulnerable. Poor sanitation exposes females to the risk of assault, and when schools cannot provide clean, safe toilets girls' attendance drops."	1
In recent years, this fishing town -- and next-wave surf spot -- has turned into a popular rest stop for Inca Trail hikers. Oceanfront lodging runs about $40 a night in ersatz hotels or campsites, but a two-night stay at O.coo, with double-size rooms, a pool table and free shuttle service, is $80.In an effort to attract more tourists and raise cash, the town has been turning O.coo into a free-of-charge attraction. The idea is that visitors are encouraged to buy souvenirs and dine at restaurants at the town's two main beaches -- the sands of Tres Cruces are a popular beach with sunbathers -- or at one of the many other beachfront restaurants set up at the town's two hotels.It seemed like a good idea when the town was founded in 2006 by two surfers and restaurant owner, but what was to be billed as the "World's Largest O.coo" was anything but.Even as it grew, the surf town was struggling to attract visitors and a new restaurant to anchor the O.coo experience and lure in tourism.The big O is just a shell of the original O.cooIn 2013, the town launched the "Big O" promotion, promising visitors to dine at the town's many beachfront restaurants for a $25 per person dinner and a round of golf at the private J.A. Wills golf resort.For its part, O.coo, which is situated on 22 miles of the Inca Trail between Machu Picchu and Machu Picchu National Park, has been busy."The surf and restaurant industry is booming in Peru, so our goal is to create a destination,” says Andrés Chiquillero, the owner of O.coo and CEO of the World's Biggest O.coo."We wanted to make an authentic experience, and to give the people that travel through Peru the opportunity to experience Peru," he says.Despite the name Big O, there is a large difference between the original O.coo and the current version.The Big O has no sandy beachfront restaurants, and the original O was a surf town, not a surf resort, so it was not a beachfront restaurant, at least not until 2013,	0
The Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words. Faced with this challenge, "It's easier to learn English!" he joked, his wit shining through, even though Alzheimer's disease had already begun its slow, relentless onslaught on his mind. Zao, widely regarded as one of the foremost Chinese contemporary painters of the 20th century, passed away at his home in Switzerland on Tuesday at the age of 93. Born in Beijing in 1920, he formed part of the second generation of Chinese artists to turn westward in their search for inspiration. Encouraged by the French-educated Chinese artist Lin Fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious Hangzhou National College of Art (today the China Academy of Art), he relocated to Paris in 1948. Although he did not know it at the time, the move would be permanent, due in part to the rapidly changing political situation in China. Apart from brief trips abroad, Zao would remain in France until the year before his death, one of the few Chinese artists from his generation to emigrate to Europe. Embraced by France, he was elected to the prestigious Academie des Beaux Arts society in 2002 and received the Legion of Honor in 2006 from then-president Jacques Chirac. For Zao and his contemporaries, Paris represented the source of modern art. Living there meant direct access to the paintings that he had until then only encountered as black-and-white reproductions in art magazines. An oil painter by vocation, he immersed himself in the riches that surrounded him -- heading directly to the Louvre on the very day he arrived in the city. Meanwhile, with the assistance of his friend and mentor, noted poet and painter Henri Michaux, and blessed with the warm charm and wit that would impress me decades later, Zao cultivated an extensive circle of fellow artists and cultural figures. In just a few years, he established himself as an integral member of the postwar French art world. Zao worked hard to find his artistic voice. At first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting -- the medium most closely associated with the Chinese painting tradition-- and subject matter that might be construed as overtly Chinese. He wished to be appreciated on his own merits and not to fall victim to stereotype.	1
The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags. The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the  most contested battle of our time - the question of who could win the White House. This time, voters decided that their vote mattered. But the consequences of that decision will be felt far far longer than this election cycle, and the country and the world will pay the price.For an in-depth look at the election from those who could have been contenders, we turned to the Democratic Party's own analysis. In this episode of The Takeaway, we speak to the top two party strategists. They're two of the most plugged-in Democratic campaign operatives you're likely to ever meet - Mark Penn and Lee Cowan. In order to understand why this year was different, we spoke to them on the eve of the Iowa caucuses. Then, as a preview to the presidential debates, we're joined by Dana Bash, who managed Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.And then, as a preview to the presidential debates, we're joined by Dana Bash, who managed Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.AMYGOODMAN: The first major election since the 2012 Democratic primary has left an incredibly divisive legacy. On one side, you have Bernie Sanders, a self-identified socialist from Vermont who argued for a $16 an hour minimum wage. With a campaign now led by Hillary Clinton, and many polls suggesting that she is doing well in New York, New Jersey and Vermont, he's been able to shift the debate about income inequality away from how well the economy is doing to how well it's doing for the working classes, the middle class and low-income folks.BASH: In terms of the impact on the debates on this campaign, I think that's a little overstated. I mean, it looks like there's a pretty big gap between what people are seeing and what they're talking about, so there's a lot of talk on the left about what this means for the debates. But the reality is, I don't think that is going to be the determining factor in the debates in the short run. I think the debates are going to be about the issues on the main stage, and that it's going to be about who can speak to the left of Clinton and the right of Sanders. So, you know,	0
I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos. She was speaking from her hospital bed in  the hospital bed where she had been recovering after nearly 15 hours of surgery."I couldn't breathe or I couldn't see anything. I had to lie down right away."Anne Vos is shown arriving at hospital hours after the earthquake.

Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting an Israeli Parliament plan to displace tens of thousands of Bedouin from southern Israel's Negev. Dozens of the protesters -- including a 12-year-old boy -- and a number of riot police were injured and dozens more were arrested. The protesters -- composed of Bedouin, Palestinians, Israeli and international activists -- were demonstrating against the Prawer Plan, which they say would displace the Negev's original inhabitants. According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would be affected by this plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000. If passed by the Knesset, the plan's implementation would destroy 35 "unrecognized" Arab Bedouin villages and displace Bedouin citizens of Israel from their historical lands in the Naqab, the Arabic name for the Negev, according to a posting on the website for Adalah, the legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel. A spokesperson for the Israeli Knesset did not immediately return a call. The demonstration here was one of 25 planned around the world -- including Jerusalem and Haifa, Washington and London. In the protests here, Israeli riot police -- some of them on horseback -- fired stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse the protesters, most of whom appeared young. Some threw stones and bottles at the police and set tires afire. "We are all here to say loudly and clearly that the Prawer Plan will not pass," Arab Knesset member Ahmad Tibi told CNN. "Prawer is the plan to take out Palestinians -- the indigenous people -- from their land in the a Negev and bring instead Jewish settlers. "We are Palestinians, we are the Arab minority here and asking to be treated equally. The Zionist point of view is to get rid of the Arabs and Palestinian from their land who are the original people in the first place and bring in Jewish settlers ... we will not accept that." Amir Abu Quaidar, an organizer of Saturday's demonstration, said the protesters were seeking to pressure the Israeli government to withdraw its plan.	1
About 250 veterans gathered today at the World War II Memorial in Washington. They were joined by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to mark the premiere of their 10-part HBO series, "The Pacific." It was a high-profile public media event, but for me it was personal. For me, it brought back memories of my dad, who fought the Nazis in Europe. When I was 9 or 10 years old, my father took me to a college basketball game. As the clock ran out, a trumpeter in the pep band thought it would be cute to mark the demise of the rival team by playing Taps. Dad was not amused. "Shut up!" he roared. The trumpeter played on, oblivious. Dad got to his feet, fists clenched. "I said, 'Shut up!'" Embarrassed, I cringed in my seat. I'd never seen Dad this upset. But most people in the noisy auditorium were unaware of his wrath. He was drowned out by cheers, and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter. Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany. Under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Terry Allen, the "Timberwolves" fought through Holland, Belgium, and into Germany, seeing unbelievable carnage. Some men became numb to it. Dad told me about seeing a couple of soldiers carelessly tossing bodies into the back of a truck to be hauled away from the battlefield. As Dad watched, a passing officer angrily chewed out the men: "These are soldiers of the United States Army," the officer yelled, "and they will be treated with respect!" Whenever Dad told that story, his voice would catch. Fast forward. Spring 1995 -- 50 years after the Nazis surrendered and some 35 years after that basketball game. His emotions were still raw as we sat together on the back porch of my home in suburban Atlanta. Over the course of three days, I held a small tape recorder between us as he talked about his life. Not surprisingly, his days in combat with the 104th took up most of the eight hours I captured on tape.	1
South African police are investigating abuse allegations at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, the talk-show host's $40 million school for disadvantaged girls near Johannesburg. Oprah Winfrey, who founded the school this year, has apologized in connection with the incident. Investigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse and said no charges have been filed. The academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent. According to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday. The newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse. In an emergency meeting with pupils and parents at the school, Winfrey apologized in connection with the incident. "I've disappointed you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry," she said tearfully, according to numerous South African media reports. Winfrey's representatives said she flew to South Africa twice in October to meet with parents of girls at the academy, although they would not specify what the meetings were about. Previously, Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- issued a statement on October 17 saying, "Nothing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy." In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and that the dorm parent was removed from the campus. "We have engaged professional investigators of the highest standing from South Africa and the United States to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into these claims," the statement said. The school's head has agreed to take a paid leave of absence pending the results of the investigation, although she is not the subject of the allegation, Samuel said. The national prosecuting authority is deciding whether or not criminal charges will be filed. In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit. The academy opened in January with a student body made up of some of South Africa's poorest children. The academy provides its 450 students with textbooks, uniforms and meals. E-mail to a friend	1
Author R.L. Stine has returned to the evil street that made him famous in the 1990s, and fans are looking forward to the new ways he'll terrorize Shadyside High School teenagers on "Fear Street." "Party Games," телевизорів, and even "The 7 Dudes of Fear Street" have been released, and Stine has a couple more things up his sleeve, like a book called "Hitchcock's Nightmare" and a new TV show called "Terrordome's Christmas."After a successful run on Nickelodeon's "Rugrats" -- the very kids who love Stine's "Party Games" will find out what makes him tick in "Fear Street" -- Stine set his sights on a new target: young readers and teens. "I've always wanted to write for the young reader," Stine says. "And I was always thinking, 'What would be the perfect book for a 10-year-old?'" Now, he has his answer: the new book, "Party Games," is now out in stores as a series."Party Games" is part of a trilogy called the "Big Five." Stine says each story in the trilogy will begin with "Party Games," a mystery starring an overprotective high schooler named J.B. who has a secret that will destroy the life of the school's vice-principal."What's great about it is that J.B. isn't J.B. at all. It was really important to me to create a character who was so different from J.B.," Stine says. "She's a real person, but is not like J.B. She's kind of out there, and she has a lot of different relationships with different people. And her friendship with Mr. Hanover has always been something that she's wanted. I thought he'd be perfect for J.B. And the way I wanted J.B. to interact with him is to be a total bully, so when Hanover was attacked in the parking lot it was so funny because it was like, 'Wow, this is really crazy. I can't believe I'm going to be on Fear Street!' "Stine has another novel, called "The 7 Dudes of Fear Street," currently in development with Universal Pictures, and he's not	0
President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday. Gates suggested that the unmanned Predator missions may be helping to avoid civilian casualties."We'll be asking for a formal assessment of the intelligence and determination of whether the U.S. intelligence has been able to fully protect the civilian population," said Gates who is on a visit to the country. He declined to provide further details about drone-strikes."Some of the targets we take out probably represent people that were trying to kill people. They were trying to kill our military targets, but when we went after people in a house that wasn't there, we didn't kill them. We were able to take them out."Gates told a news conference in Washington that the U.S. will begin "targeted strikes" on suspected al-Qaeda militants in the country, including a compound in the city of Misurata and a second compound in Tripoli."There has to be a careful distinction between what we're doing over here that's intended to take out specific individuals, and what we're doing over there that's intended to take out specific al-Qaeda. That distinction is important," Gates said.NATO-lead forces were fighting al-Qaeda in Tripoli in July when the United States launched a campaign it called a "continuation of operations" (COO) against al-Qaeda in Libya.The Pentagon had been monitoring anti-government Libyan militias linked to and funded by the al-Qaeda-linked rebels, who now control much of the country.Gates said that some strikes may have been "accidental" while others occurred in close proximity "in order to avoid civilian casualties, which clearly are a concern."Gates said that an unclassified description from the U.S. military of the attacks against targets in Tripoli was that most of the strikes were "accidental strikes."He said that the Defense Department was monitoring where the military drones went in order to ensure that civilian casualties were minimized."I think there's been an effort to try to get some of these strikes to be on targets that might not necessarily have been intended to be struck. And we're doing a very careful, thorough assessment of the intelligence to determine whether those strikes were intentional," Gates said.The Libyan capital and most cities have	0
The defense for Charles Taylor is expected to submit its counter-recommendation Thursday after prosecutors said the former Liberian president deserves an 80-year sentence for a war crimes conviction. Taylor was found guilty last month of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's civil war. "Should the trial chamber decide to impose a global sentence, 80 years' imprisonment would be appropriate," said Brenda Hollis, chief prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In the statement last week, the prosecutor said the sentence reflects the gravity of the crimes. "But for Charles Taylor's criminal conduct, thousands of people would not have had limbs amputated, would not have been raped, would not have been killed," Hollis said. "The recommended sentence provides fair and adequate response to the outrage these crimes caused in victims, their families and relatives." Last month's landmark ruling by the international tribunal was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. Taylor, 64, was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. Prosecutors accused Taylor of financing and giving orders to rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. His support for the rebels fueled the bloody war, prosecutors said. Prosecutors, however, failed to prove that he had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities. There is no death penalty in international criminal law, and he would serve out any sentence in a British prison. Taylor has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades, and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. His trial was at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. U.N. officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Taylor becomes the first former head of state since Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide, to be convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal.	1
A Georgia man convicted of kidnapping and killing his girlfriend was executed Tuesday. A Geogia official says executed killer William Earl Lynd did not make a final statement. William Earl Lynd was the first inmate to die by injection since Arkansas in 1997 and the nation’s first execution by machine. More From NBC and NBC News Share TweetWilliam Earl Lynd, a convicted murderer who was executed for killing his girlfriend, made no final appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.In an execution video on Tuesday, Lynd said, "I don't want to die."A deputy at the Georgia Department of Corrections told NBC News earlier that Lynd did not want to make statements — an odd decision following his death sentence, which includes lethal injection, but does not say whether he wants to be put to death.Lethal injection is Georgia's state execution method, but it was not approved by the US Supreme Court after several death row inmates protested.Lynd's girlfriend, Stacy Lynn Johnson, was found in the woods on Feb. 2, 2014, with two gunshot wounds to the back and abdomen. Her body was covered in blood. The murder went unsolved.Lynd's lawyers said he didn't intend to kill Johnson and had no motive. He admitted to police that he shot her while she was making a getaway attempt in Clayton County, according to court documents and police testimony.Defense lawyers said the shooting was an accident, because Lynd was drunk and his gun was uncharacteristically not aimed.Court records show Lynd waived his right to a jury trial in Clayton County Superior Court in July 2017 and received life imprisonment without parole, with no possibility of parole after 30 years for kidnapping and aggravated assault with intent to commit murder.The Georgia Supreme Court, which was the final arbiter on whether the death sentence was appropriate, voted on Tuesday to uphold the ruling, saying it found the death sentence appropriate based on the evidence presented at trial."The trial judge’s findings as to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were supported by the record and supported the life sentence," the court said in its ruling.The court said that Lynd was a dangerous offender and that Lynd had shown remorse for Johnson's death during his testimony in the trial, at which he did not make a final statement.The death sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole as part of a court-san	0
It is a Sunday night in Bridgetown, Barbados. Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing -- cricket. On this night, locals gather at historic vernacular St. George's, one of the island's oldest churches, to watch the Caribbean Premier League, and, by extension, the rest of the world's cricket too.In the late 90s and early 2000, local cricket was in decline. The island had two main professional franchises, one based in Bridgetown, the other in Bridgetown Town, and the latter was a major source of income for surrounding areas such as Bridgetown West, Bridgetown North and Bridgetown South. But a young man who lived in the Bridgetown Town area, and who would go on to become a famous cricketer, noticed something different about the Bridgetown Town franchise: They were winning the whole of the West Indies.This was no coincidence, he had decided. After all, this was how the West Indies had won the 1966 World Cup. And here's how:In 1962, the West Indies won all their six matches in Barbados by a solitary wicket. But they did so by playing an absolute game of cricket in their last match on that trip, as they did to a maximum of 14 runs; and they did so by the most famous man in the history of West Indian cricket, the great fast bowler, Garry Sobers.Not only did Sobers play a brilliant opening spell, with the bowlers taking him to 98, while the West Indies scored just 20, but Sobers himself also had three tons, the most of any Barbados bowler, in a match against a team from the Netherlands, who'd knocked off more than 20 runs at that same stage of the innings.West Indies won that World Cup by two wickets. Sobers's record is now 10 for 4, three of them taking more than 200 runs. But he's still only second on Barbados's all-time wicket-takers list.The great Sobers wasn't alone. West Indians also found inspiration in the West Indies' great batsman, Clive Lloyd. Before Lloyd took over the captaincy of the West Indies in 1971, he led West Indies to the World Cup final there, again, and by a margin of only	0
From choosing the right festival to tips on camping and pacing yourself through the shows, here's (almost) everything you'll need to know about preparing for your next music festival. When I went to my first summer musical ents, one of the main problems I had was finding a good parking spot. I didn't have a clue where to park, but I did have a car, so I just showed up and did what I could. But my car was the size of a fridge. No one really had a good spot. The festival itself wasn't too bad, but I felt rushed because it was my first time. I didn't get much chance to see all the people who were there.If you've never done this before, I have a few tips. You should try to make it to the festival on the same night the music starts. If you do go to the festival on the same day that the music starts, the festival is going to be way less crowded and you could get to see everyone. I also like to make sure that my car is in working order, so that I can pull up to a spot and just cruise around. That way I don't waste any time finding a spot and getting in. Finally, try to get to the fest at the end of the day. That way you're not competing with people who have already been there all day.#1: What are you looking for?For the most part, most festivals I've been to are small in size and don't take up much real estate, so I can get to a lot of different events. If you are talking about going to a large festival with a lot of big-name acts, or a small local festival with local acts, then it'll probably be a bigger issue of location and logistics.The first thing you need to know is what festival you want to go to. Are you looking for a large outdoor festival with the biggest names in metal, pop, rock, electronic, punk, reggae, dubstep, hip-hop, hip-hop-rap, and dubstep-rap? Or are you looking for a smaller, more intimate festival with smaller-name acts? This will set the scene for what size festival you want. Some festivals might work for either type - for example, the UK festival Rock Werchter is a huge fest that attracts big name acts, but a lot of the smaller acts that were on the	0
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday he appreciated U.S. President Barack Obama's friendly gestures at last weekend's Summit of the Americas, but said they don't change his view of the United States as an imperialist nation. Hugo Chavez had handshakes and smiles for President Obama at the Summit of the Americas last weekend. Chavez's fiery diatribes against the United States have included referring to former President George W. Bush as the devil. He was photographed with Obama at least twice at the summit -- once when Obama shook hands with him and other leaders, and again when he approached Obama to give him a book. "The hand[shake], yes. And the smile, yes -- one time and a second time and a third time and a fourth time," Chavez said during a televised address. "But nobody should be mistaken. The empire is there, alive and kicking." The book Chavez presented to Obama as cameras rolled is titled "Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent." The book chronicles Europe's and the United States' role in "the effects and causes of capitalist underdevelopment in Latin America," according to one reviewer. As he has in the past, Chavez noted Obama's historic role as the first black U.S. president. "I hope Obama, for the dignity of his race, may be the last president of an imperialist United States," he said.	1
Former Bosnian leader Ejup Ganic will not be extradited to Serbia, a British court ruled Tuesday, setting him free. Ganic called the extradition request "a textbook example of abuse," accusing the Serbian government of trying to "undermine the judiciary in this country." The extradition request was politically motivated, Justice Timothy Workman found in throwing it out. "No striking or substantial new evidence" was brought against him, the judge ruled. Ganic, who was arrested at England's Heathrow Airport in March at Serbia's request, is wanted in Serbia for conspiracy to murder in breach of the Geneva Conventions, a spokesman at Britain's Foreign Office said. Ganic's lawyer, Stephen Gentle, denied that he had any role in the 1992 killings in question. In April, Gentle said that "the extradition request is politically motivated. It is legally flawed, and he has nothing to hide." Ganic was the vice president of Bosnia during the civil war there between 1992 and 1995 and was twice president of the Bosnian-Croat Federation in the years following the 1995 Dayton peace agreement. Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership. Though Bosnian, Ganic was born in Serbia and speaks with a recognizable Serbian accent. He holds dual nationality in the former Yugoslav republics. He is leaving London for Sarajevo on Wednesday, he said. CNN's Andrew Carey contributed to this report.	1
This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit. The tournament has been hosted in  the Bay Area for 40 years, and the tradition of Stanford and San Jose as the host site for every edition of the Bank of the West Classic has been honored by the tournament since its inception in 1990.The TournamentLast year’s field expanded to the largest tournament draw yet in the Bank of the West Classic, with more than 18,000 people watching at the Stanford Tennis Center. A highlight on the final day of the tournament was Stefanie Voegele, a Stanford sophomore who became the youngest ever to reach a semifinal at the Bank of the West Classic, when she defeated second-seeded Venus Williams on the third day of the tournament on Monday. She was the first Stanford player to win the Bank of the West Classic on its debut in 1990, she is the only Stanford player to have ever made it to the final since 1990, she is the fifth player to reach the final in the Bank of the West Classic, and she has been named Bank of the West Classic Tournament MVP since its inception in 1990.The Tournament FormatThe Bank of the West Classic is a 48-player tournament that is divided across two days and follows the WTA Tour’s three-day tournament format. There are 16 teams involved, with two qualifying spots up for grabs each day at 6 a.m. PT, and the top 16 teams in the draw advance to the semifinals. The 16 teams qualify to the weekend with the two qualifiers, and the first- and second-ranked teams in the world will be assured of making the weekend. The top 16 teams will play one another in the eight quarterfinals on Sunday, and the top eight will advance to the semifinals. The semifinal matches, which are played on Monday, will be played within four points, while the semi-finals will consist of five total points.The Qualifying RoundsIn order to qualify for the Classic, each team in the tournament has to reach the quarterfinal round. On the first day of the Classic, the top 16 teams in the draw will join a qualifying tournament where they will battle through a series of five-set matches. The top four teams will advance into the Classic, which will be played in two days.	0
For conservatives conflicted over how to vote on a major measure Wednesday that would fund the federal government and authorize the President to arm Syrian rebels, their decision might have gotten a bit ickier when they found out the results from polling.The top two vote-getters in Virginia, Republicans Sen. Mark Warner and Gov. Bob McDonnell, and in Maryland, President Obama, have been outspending both President-elect Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton by enormous amounts.But when Virginia’s pollsters asked voters what their top two vote-getters should do, those were the responses, with the same options in every survey: “I don’t have any opinions,” “Trump,” “Clinton,” “They both are okay” and “No preference.”“It’s really no surprise, but it’s also not a good result for us,” said Bob Holsworth, a long-time Republican pollster who is now backing down from his anti-Trump stance, while still criticizing the GOP for not being better campaign-spending managers. “It really stumps us.”As the results revealed on Tuesday, Romney was the candidate with the better ground game: he and Trump were the only two to draw support from the undecideds, and they were the only candidates to win the support of independents. But the more important question in Virginia, and in other swing states, is how voters would vote if there was a run-off between Obama and Romney, or a run-off between the president and the third-party candidate.So the pollsters were trying to find out if voters thought Obama might win the election, or if they would vote for Clinton if Republicans were reduced to two, or if Trump would lose by a landslide and the election be decided by a second ballot.But more to the point, voters are asked to speculate whether two candidates they barely know, rather than candidates they have seen on TV and radio, would win against each other. The issue has become a rallying cry for Republicans, who have been frustrated by the lack of organization they have shown in trying to defeat Trump. Their message was that the electorate is too uneducated, or too old, or too ignorant, or too divided, or too partisan, or too racist or too sexist or too right-wing for the party to win	0
Louis Oosthuizen delivered a masterful third-round display to take control of the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Massachusetts on Sunday to put the South ern Dutchman in the hunt for his first European Tour title. Oosthuizen fired a final round of five under par 80 to finish at 10 under, beating reigning champion Justin Rose by five shots.Though not the first player in his Mercedes to win in this championship, it is Oosthuizen's third victory of the year, and his second on tour. He also became the second-youngest player to win his first Deutsche Bank Challenge after defending his Open title earlier in the year.His second triumph was in a playoff, after firing a final round of 69 at the 2016 U.S. Senior Open to get his first career win.“It’s the most difficult championship I’ve ever played, and I was fortunate to make that putt for victory,” Oosthuizen said. “To make a bogey at the 18th hole on Sunday and then miss the putt for eagle on the next hole, that’s a big story. That was the story all day.”Oosthuizen said he felt more relaxed heading into his final round than at his previous two in this tournament, but still struggled with inconsistent putting.He posted rounds of 70, 73 and 73 to reach 10 under overall – the best finish by a European Tour member since 2010.“I needed to make a couple good putts to be able to put myself in contention there,” Oosthuizen said. “I was just nervous because I played my back nine perfect, and I’m always nervous. And obviously I had a couple of poor putts before I made a couple good putts afterwards, and then I was able to get into contention.”He also became the second-youngest player to win his first Deutsche Bank Challenge, after defending his Open title earlier in the year.The other American to win with a victory in this competition is Rose, who was just 21 years old at the time. He beat Nick Taylor in a four-hole playoff at the U.S. Senior Open following a win at the Wyndham Championship.“It’s like when I won the Open,” Rose said. “	0
A man opens fire in a national park, killing a ranger who was attempting to stop him after he blew through a vehicle checkpoint. A second man is suspected in the stabbing deaths of four homeless men in Southern California. Both men, U.S. military veterans, served in Iraq -- and both, according to authorities and those who knew them, returned home changed men after their combat service. Iraq War vet could face death penalty A coincidence -- two recent high-profile cases? Or a sign of an increase in hostile behavior as U.S. troops complete their withdrawal from Iraq, similar to that seen when U.S. troops returned home from the Vietnam War? "You're going to see this more and more over the next 10 years," said Shad Meshad, founder of the National Veterans Foundation, who has been working with veterans since 1970. "... There's a percentage that come back, depending on how much trauma and how much killing they're involved in, they're going to act out." Margaret Anderson, a ranger at Washington state's Mount Rainier National Park, was shot to death on New Year's Day. Police believe Benjamin Colton Barnes, who served in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, was responsible for the shooting. After a manhunt, authorities found Barnes' body face down in a creek in the park. According to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KIRO, the woman with whom Barnes was in a custody dispute said she believed he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his deployment. Barnes was emotionally unstable, vindictive and anger-prone, the woman said, and owned many knives and guns. The woman said she was frightened to be in the same state with him, the documents said. In California, former Marine Cpl. Itzcoatl Campo is accused of stabbing four homeless men to death. According to the military, Campo was deployed to Iraq during 2008. A friend of his, who asked to be identified only as Brian, told CNN Monday that "something happened" after Campo returned from Iraq. "He was a little bit more serious. It seemed like there was something on his mind," Brian said. "He seemed really depressed and down, and things in his life weren't looking that well." His father, Refugio Campo, told the Orange County Register that upon his return, his son began talking about things that "didn't make any sense," like the end of the world.	1
Two charges against Chris Brown were dropped Tuesday, but the singer is still accused of hit and run after a minor traffic crash. Brown's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf and a judge ordered him to show up at a sheriff's station within a week to be officially booked on the charge, according to a court spokesman. The prosecutor dismissed charges of driving without a license and driving without proof of insurance during a hearing Tuesday in a Van Nuys, California, court. Brown allegedly sped away from the accident scene in May after a confrontation with the driver of another car, having refusing to provide his name, driver's license and insurance information. The hit and run charge threatens Brown's freedom since it led a judge to revoke his probation last week in connection with his conviction in the beating of his girlfriend, Rihanna. The judge allowed Brown to remain free until a trial is held. A Brown representative said last week that the singer expected all of the charges to be dropped and probation reinstated this week. Brown, 24, was already facing a probation violation trial after prosecutors accused him of not completing the community labor ordered for his 2009 felony assault conviction. Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna. A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he "went ballistic" after the traffic accident and screamed at her. According to the police report on the incident, the other driver, Olga Gure, quoted Brown as shouting at her: "You are a b---h!" The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, "Who do you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money than you, b---h!" The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said.	1
A journalist was among three people killed Friday during clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Egyptian security forces in eastern Cairo, Egypt's Interior Ministry said. Mayada Ashraf was fatally shot, according to her employer, the private Egyptian newspaper Al-Dustour. She was covering the fighting when she was killed, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. The clashes involved people who were protesting this week's decision by Egyptian army chief Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to resign from the military and run for president, semiofficial news outlet Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators were supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ahram Online said. Ashraf was in her 20s and graduated from college last year, according to Al-Dustour. Definitive information on who shot her wasn't immediately available. A representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists called on the Egyptian government Friday to open an independent and impartial investigation into Ashraf's death. The organization noted that opposing groups -- those supporting the army, and those supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood -- were blaming each other for the killing. "A journalist's death should not be used to settle political scores -- the focus should be on journalists' right to safely cover events in Egypt," said Sherif Mansour, the CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. Protests similar to that in eastern Cairo happened across the country on Friday, Ahram Online reported. El-Sisi's decision is just one of the latest grievances expressed by Morsy supporters. El-Sisi deposed Morsy last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule. Morsy became Egypt's first freely elected leader in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. El-Sisi is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing him as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since Mubarak's 2011 ouster. But El-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and the author of a fierce crackdown on dissent. Egypt has suffered bloody internal strife since Morsy was overthrown.	1
It's normally the domain of loose change and missing remotes, but after what one couple discovered in  their local area in Virginia and Arizona, you may want to consider using a more permanent solution.If you have a remote that's been on the "hold":You can usually get a new remote from a service center via E-mail.If you already have a remote that's been on the "hold":You can buy a new remote at the same location or elsewhere online.Both are fine and both are safe:    Remote will arrive in a box to protect against theft.    Remote will arrive in a box to protect against fire or water damage.What The Couple Had To DoCathy and John used a remote to control the temperature of their home.  When they made an appointment to discuss a home repair or heating problem, they called around and came to the conclusion that they didn't want to go by appointment, they wanted the service company to come and fix their problem.Now they weren't alone in trying to change a routine routine.  The American Association of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Technicians (AAHRT) reported a 17 percent decrease in the number of appointments for repairs in the month of June, 2009.  In 2008, there were over 26.8 million appointments for repair in the U.S., as opposed to just over 25 million appointments the same month the previous year.And here's what happened:  The couple was asked questions about their home system by the service technician, and then she told the couple how long they should expect the repair process to take, and she showed them how to read the system manual.After the technician left the couple's home, she told them:  "You have a remote to control the temperature inside.  You can adjust it as needed from anywhere in the house."When the couple realized their home was in good shape, but they wanted to make sure it didn't get worse, they called up their home service company and took advantage of the special offer they had received.  They received an E-mail that their furnace was on its way to the shop.  So they took a look at their remote, and then they were given another remote for their refrigerator.What They Should Have DoneBy the time she left,	0
Two United Arab Emirates based companies announced on Tuesday that they will be investing in the Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan. Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, called the project "a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy." Four hundred and sixty one million square feet have been officially assigned to "Gas Cities LLC," a joint venture between Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum, both Sharjah-based companies, to establish a new venture: "Kurdistan Gas City." Kurdistan Gas City will include industrial, residential and commercial buildings in an integrated city. The expected initial investment in basic infrastructure is estimated at $3 billion, with further foreign direct investment exceeding $40 billion during the operations phase. Work will start on the project, which is designed to promote private sector investment in a variety of gas-related industries, on September 21. Gas City is structured to hold over 20 varieties of world scale petrochemical and heavy manufacturing plants, and hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), served by state-of-the-art facilities. Mr Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, said: "Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum have made a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy through their work in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq thus far, we are making significant progress in spurring on economic growth and creating opportunity for our people." Hamid Jafar, Executive Chairman of Dana Gas, explained the importance of this achievement saying: "The Kurdistan Gas City is an enormous step forward in Dana Gas' strategy across the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia." The Kurdistan Gas City is projected to generate job opportunities for nearly 200,000 Iraqi citizens in infrastructure, industrial projects, support services and other business activities. This is not the first project for Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, the two companies are committed to a service agreement signed in April 2007 with the Kurdistan Regional Government to build 180 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and two liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plants, which are 80 percent complete. The project is on track and will start pumping 150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the coming weeks, rising to 300 million cubic feet by early 2009. Other companies from the UAE showed similar interest in Kurdistan Region "Damac Properties" one of the major private developers in the regions revealed on June 3 plans for a $16 billion residential, commercial and recreational project.	1
Hip-hop and rap artist Petey Pablo is facing nearly three years in prison after sentencing on a guilty plea of possessing a stolen firearm, according to federal prosecutors. Pablo, whose real name is Moses Barrett, was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court in New Bern, North Carolina, to 35 months in prison. The sentencing came following a March guilty plea from the 38-year-old performer, who lives in Wake Forest, North Carolina. According to a statement from Thomas G. Walker, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Pablo was going through security at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on September 11, 2010, when a loaded semi-automatic 9 mm pistol was found in his bag. Pablo was attempting to board a flight to Los Angeles, the statement said. Federal authorities determined that the pistol had been stolen during a residential burglary in California in 2005. Pablo, who is best known for his songs "Raise Up" and "Freek-a-Leek" is scheduled to begin serving his sentence in December.	1
A wave of explosions targeting Syrian government forces killed dozens of people at a popular Aleppo square Wednesday in an attack for which a Syria-based extremist group has claimed responsibility. Al-Nusra Front said the strikes were carried out by suicide bombs, adding the U.S. had informed them that the attack was carried out by a Western aircraft.On the government side, Syrian state television said a missile slammed into the Al-Noor Martyrs` Mosque in Aleppo’s Bustan Al-Qubrus neighborhood; three people were killed and 15 others were injured.“This is a cruel crime against the Syrian people, not only me, but all the Syrian people, we condemn the attack with all our strength, and we call upon the world to unite and stop these crimes in Syria,” said Syrian President Bashar Assad.“The international community must stop the support for ISIS and stop the funding of terrorism, and bring a solution to this problem,” he told a news conference. “This is an important day for Syria, and an important day for the world.”The Syrian Red Crescent said it transported 20 injured people to hospitals in Aleppo and Damascus.Rami Abdul-Rahman, the head of the White Helmets group, said they are helping the wounded and there were “many injuries on both sides.”A statement from the United Nations’ refugee agency in Turkey, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), expressed its “deepest concern about the loss of life in these coordinated terrorist attacks in Syria.”“The deaths and injured must be brought to an end as soon as possible,” the statement by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said. “The Syrian government and the armed opposition are not the same, and their actions mustn’t be interpreted as such. It is important to take all necessary measures to prevent such events from happening again.”This is not a new development. We’ve already had news reports (1, 2, 3) that al-Nusra front claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack.The United States Department of State said it is “reviewing” U.S. assistance to the Syrian government, and that it does “not currently have specific intelligence to indicate that the Syrian government was responsible for the	0
What do NSA leaker Edward Snowden and a red panda at the National Zoo in Washington have in common? Absolutely nothing. Except that both mysteriously vanished. And both were the subjects of high-profile searches -- at least for a little while, in the case of the panda. But a little while was all Twitter needed to engage in a flurry of jokes, including the creation of several parody accounts for Rusty, the red panda. There were a few, tenuous parallels. Both are male. Both are relatively young -- Rusty is 1, Snowden is 30. And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China. OK, perhaps that last one is a bit of a stretch. But social media transcends all boundaries.	1
In 2009, du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, 47, was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter and served no jail time because, a judge said, he would "not fare well" in prison. You are only just hearing about this travesty thanks to a civil suit filed recently by Richards' ex-wife, Tracy Richards, alleging that he also sexually abused his 19-month-old son during the same period. How does this happen? Lady Justice wears a blindfold that's supposed to represent objectivity. Unfortunately, it seems to blind her in some cases, especially when a defendant is wealthy and connected. And Richards is wealthy and connected -- he's the heir to not one, but two fortunes provided to him by his predecessors. In 2008, Richards was indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape for sexually penetrating his daughter repeatedly from 2005 to 2007. Those two counts would have carried mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years each. He was released on $60,000 bail. Richards is unemployed, but with a trust fund and apparently had plenty of cash to hire one of the state's top law firms. His lawyers pushed until Delaware prosecutors offered a deal allowing him the fourth-degree rape plea -- normally reserved for statutory rape cases -- and Richards admitted the assault. At the sentencing, Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden ordered Richards to attend a sex offender rehabilitation program and pay a whopping $4,395 to the Delaware Violent Crimes Compensation Board. (That'll teach him!) She then sentenced him to eight years in prison, but suspended the prison time and put him on probation instead, writing: "Defendant will not fare well in Level 5 setting." Translation for the rest of the world: The rich rapist will "fare well" living as a free man in a house where he raped his own daughter. A few points here: 1. The purpose of prison is twofold -- to keep criminals segregated from their victims and the rest of society, to punish them by denying them the freedoms that law-abiding citizens enjoy and to rehabilitate them. Prisons are loaded with pedophile rapists who are incarcerated regardless of their ability to deal with the prison environment. If Richards was a relative of the Dipshots, instead of the du Ponts he'd probably be behind bars now.	1
Why did I fall in love with superheroes? For me, it was all about the masks. You see, growing up in the '70s, I learned early on that expecting to see someone who looked like me in a heroic role on TV or in the vernacular was a very dangerous thing to do, even if the character you saw had a few superhero movie elements going on.Yes, I've known that since I was a kid, but it's one of those things I've learned to live with, even though it will still nag at me a few times a year. The best, most realistic superhero character I can think of is one for which I have never met, let alone seen, who was named by the writer of a comic I wrote.So what is it, and where does he come from? It all started in the summer of 2009, when I picked up a copy of The Amazing Spider-Man for the first time. When the book was first published, it took the form of a series of four-issue arcs, but for some reason the series ended there. The book kept going, and I continued to buy it each time. It was on my shelf for a year or so, and by that time I was in love. I bought another copy for myself and my boyfriend, then a third book when mine began to go out of print. I had a growing collection of comics, mostly the ones I liked, but I had no idea what exactly was making me fall in love with these comic books.This all started by accident: I had a crush on a character who was introduced in a series of comics I was writing some years before. He looked a lot like my boyfriend, and that was enough for me to take notice. And a year later, I was in love.It only seems like a year, but it is a full-fledged phenomenon. This happened over the course of the following dozen years, each one bringing more comics to my collection, each time seeing more of these characters, each time falling in love with and creating a story for them. My story continues, to be continued by hundreds of other readers on the internet, who have told me they share the same feelings that I have as I write this story.And what are they? The answers are complex, but all of them have to do with these characters who have become my friends through one of the simplest and most	0
To the unaccustomed eye, a man toting 120 books while riding a stubborn donkey would seem nothing short of a circus spectacle. But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a ersatz showman.Soriano is part of an unlikely alliance of artists – artists who, without any special training, have come together to preserve and renew the memory of the many who have died over the past 200 years of the country’s civil war.From the days of Colombia’s independence through the war of the 1980s, to the present day, thousands of young people have lost their lives in the “dirty war”.As they pass, young men and women are remembered in stone mounds in the capital Bogali, in the provinces of Quindio, Magdalena and Ibagué. Some are no more than names etched into stone, while others provide a history of the war – and the struggle against it.For Soriano, the mounds are a source of inspiration. His art depicts the dead alongside their loved ones, and the way in which those mounds bear witness to their lives. Most have been erected over the past 20 years, after the Colombian army destroyed hundreds of crosses and other mounds erected by activists in the 1980s.Colombia’s history is one of extreme violence. The country had been ruled by Spain for centuries but became independent in 1818. Spanish troops invaded the country during the 1819 rebellion until the death of Simón Bolívar at the hands of royalist insurgents.Colombians fought for decades against Spain before an uprising against the monarchy in 1831 resulted in a defeat for the royalists, who agreed to hold talks with the rebels. In 1876, a new constitutional monarchy took power over the country, and Colombia became a constitutional republic.Until the 1960s, the United Republic of Colombia was one of the world’s richest countries. But poverty and corruption spread to the countryside, which was divided into armed guerilla armies. The country’s history of violence took its toll on the population.In the 1970s, as the political system changed from military dictatorships to free elections, the murder rate began to soar. In the early 1980s, the civil war broke out. The conflict became the largest in Latin America, with an estimated	0
It's said nothing is certain in life except for death and taxes. For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death. They fear one of Europe's top leagues, newly resurgent following  European distractions, will put them out of business.That's where it's at. Football is in a bad way. English clubs are not in such a state. Their fortunes and revenues have grown considerably following the Premier League's recent success; however, that doesn't mean that the English game is immune from the economic downturn currently hitting Europe. As the new tax laws were implemented, the English clubs felt the full force of the new policies, which have been enforced by UEFA, the professional football association that was formed after the Second World War.The tax law, which requires all professional and European football clubs to pay a 25% tax on their player's salaries and 20% tax on their commercial profits, was introduced last year in a vote by the executive committee. On the one hand, the new tax law is meant to reduce the burden on clubs and their fans by ensuring that all European football clubs will be paid fairly, ensuring that clubs don't have to sell their best players at their peak value for next to nothing. The tax on commercial profits was introduced to help clubs make ends meet after they had lost their best young players to international, European and American clubs.On the other hand, the tax law also punishes clubs that have made a profit over the past two years. According to UEFA regulations, a club must pay at least 70% of its player's salary to UEFA. Clubs must also pay at least 40% of their annual profit to UEFA. Furthermore, a club's tax bill must be calculated on its player's salary and revenues only rather than player's wages and the clubs turnover.So, how does it work? To avoid tax liabilities to UEFA, clubs must transfer part of the player's wages to a bank account that is not taxed. A club must also transfer the other half of its profit to an account that is not taxed (this rule was changed last season). The tax law does not require that a club transfer any part of its commercial profits to third parties. A player could therefore avoid tax liability by holding on to part of his salary as personal, but it's considered too complicated and risky to do so, so that is out of the question.The only way to avoid tax liabilities is	0
Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence? Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an "invasion" of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east. While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there's little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels -- and that's saying something, given the volatility over the past many months. The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid. That admission didn't end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through. All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn't accompanying them due to the "volatile security situation" -- a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies -- including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States -- see this convoy as perhaps Moscow's most glaring, egregious move yet. "We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross," said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service. Right now, Ukraine isn't planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians. To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine's government -- not his -- that's being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine. Putin expressed "serious concern" to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine's "continued (military) escalation," according to the Kremlin. He further criticized what he characterized as "Kiev's blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid" into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act. "Further delay would have been unacceptable," a Kremlin statement said.	1
A true revolution doesn't come every day.  The word "revolution" appears all around us, in commercial advertisements and political propaganda, until it seems to have lost all meaning. The most minor tumult, the smallest change, and immediately we pronounce the word.  And so when the real thing arrives, with tyranny and blood, with masses striving for freedom, with an ancient regime destroyed and a new one born, we might just fail to see its significance. The spark that began the revolution was something called Europe: a trade agreement with the European Union that many Ukrainians saw as a chance to enter a world of free trade rather than government syndicates, and the rule of law rather than overwhelming corruption.  When President Viktor Yanukovych, after months of promised, rejected the deal in November, Ukrainians protested. The students were the first to reach the "Maidan," the main square of Kiev.  They are the ones who already considered themselves Europeans, and took a European future for granted.  After the riot police were sent to beat them, they were joined by the "Afghans," the veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Then came the businessmen, the professionals, the people who had hoped to make an honest living, but found themselves thwarted by unpredictable taxes and corruption.  In December, hundreds of thousands of people, from all parts of the country and all walks of life, were on the streets. Then Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared with a proposal.  Why not take 15 billion euros from Russia instead of playing around with Europe? Although the Russian side promised that the loan was without conditions, Russian leaders then explained that disbursements could only follow when political stability had been established. In January, President Yanukovych formally did away with basic freedoms.  A package of legislation introduced by a pro-Russian legislator and rushed illegally through parliament introduced a number of laws that closely resembled Russian models. Ukrainians reacted as Americans would if the Bill of Rights one day disappeared. After weeks of peacefully tolerating beatings, torture and disappearances, some of the protesters took the fight to the police.  Once again Moscow made clear that the next tranche of the loan would depend upon political stability.  Last week a truce was declared, and a day of mourning announced for the protesters who died.  On the day of mourning, the Ukrainian government mounted snipers on rooftops.  They shot dozens more protesters dead.	1
The coalition commander in Afghanistan went to the site of a recent airstrike and apologized for civilian deaths, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Friday. ISAF Commander Gen. John Allen paid his condolences to survivors of victims in Logar province, southeast of the capital, Kabul. Sahib Khan, a member of the Afghan parliament from Logar, said Wednesday's airstrike killed 18 people, including women and children, near the volatile Pakistan border. NATO forces said the strike occurred when soldiers returned fire during a mission targeting a Taliban leader. An ISAF spokesman said insurgents were killed and security forces seized weapons and explosives. The allegations of civilian casualties reverberated through the Afghan government and Washington as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta arrived in Kabul for talks on Thursday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the strike, saying, "NATO operations that inflict human and material losses to civilians can in no way be justifiable, acceptable and tolerable." Afghan official: NATO airstrike kills 8 family members Panetta did not address the controversy over the airstrike in his public remarks while in Kabul. The news came ahead of discussions between Panetta, Allen and Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak. While militant attacks have caused by far the greatest number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, many Afghans and coalition members have expressed concern about civilian deaths caused by air operations. The latest allegations of civilian casualties also come at a critical time for the United States. Though U.S. military and political officials have said publicly that Afghanistan will be ready to take over security of its country by the time NATO troops depart, critics have said there are questions about whether Afghan forces can stand on their own.	1
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, speaking to mobile tech leaders in Barcelona, said WhatsApp,  the mobile messaging app purchased by the social media giant last week, was "worth more than $19 billion." Zuckerberg's comments at Mobile World  Congress were published on Tuesday. According to reports, the WhatsApp acquisition price was $16.5 billion or about $100 per user.The company's stock has gained almost 10 percent in after hours trading, up to $26.The New York Times reported that Facebook bought the technology from the software developers behind WhatsApp. That could have been the reason for the price.Zuckerberg didn't reveal the total size of the acquisition, but he said WhatsApp will be acquired by Facebook while remaining independent."We won't be shutting down WhatsApp," he said. "We will be bringing it to you."Zuckerberg was also asked whether there will be a Facebook-branded mobile device."Right now, we don't have a new product that's ready for you to put in your pocket that is going to be better than WhatsApp. That's very much our plan," he said when asked about a Facebook phone.Zuckerberg was asked about the threat that Chinese government companies -- backed by the Chinese government -- may use the security and access to user data to control the outcome of elections. Those companies could be funded by the Chinese government and not be subject to its anti-monopoly laws."This is a country that is going to be a leading player in AI [artificial intelligence] and in this area to build infrastructure that is safer and better in every way. We will do everything we can to protect the privacy protections of our users.You can read the full transcript of Zuckerberg's news conference below:Zuckerberg: We think WhatsApp is worth over $19 billion or more when you combine that with the fact that it's not a messaging company.

Cityscapes are usually breathtaking, but finding a good vantage point in a new town can be tough. Not for On the Roofs (OTR), a loose collective of photographers from Moscow who have made it their mission to vernalize the New York City skyline to look like an 18th-century garden.“We’re not here to document landmarks, but rather places of power and leisure,” says Nikolai Yatschenko, a curator of the photographers’ website. They take pictures of people on the roof tops of buildings. “We try to create pictures of people’s lives in the city.” The idea, he says, is to give “something to people that they have never experienced.”The OTR’s take on the Empire State Building began in January of 2013 when Alexander Poltavchenko shared a few pictures in Instagram. “One day I was checking my phone and I saw someone asking for the Empire State Building. They were offering to give people a tour for $1 or $2. And then I got to thinking about it. Why not do this? The people would be happy. We can make money out of it. In Russia we can do this all the time,” he says.Within days, a few dozen people had posted photos on OTR’s Instagram account. That, combined with the #skywalk hashtag, soon helped the collective take on the project.“There were some really dedicated people here,” says Yatschenko, who came up with the hashtag in early 2014.Within a week, the hashtag was trending on Twitter and it caught on.“It was a big challenge to get the right people to take the pictures. We could not have a crowd of 200 people,” he says.By May, the group had raised about $2,500 and started the Empire State Building Skywalk Tour. They recruited photographers with a similar skill set to OTR such as Alexey Tsymbal, a Russian artist who has taken pictures of the Moscow metro, the Kremlin, and Red Square.“We wanted to show these places as they might have been when they had been open to the public,” says Yatschenko. “Like a giant park or garden in the 16th century.

Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity. Alfredo Cristiani in 1994 shortly after he voted during the country's second round presidential runoff. The case involves the killing of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her teenaged daughter nearly two decades ago during El Salvador's civil war. In addition, 14 former Salvadoran military officers are accused of war crimes, murders and state terrorism in connection with the massacre dating back to November 1989. Most of the slain Jesuits were born in Spain. They were killed at their residence at the prestigious Central American University, in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador. Reports at the time said they were tortured and then shot. It has become one of the most notorious episodes of El Salvador's 12-year civil war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed conservative government. Some 75,000 people died. The case filed by two human rights groups in Madrid argues that justice was never done in El Salvador. Two military officers were convicted of murder in 1991 in the deaths of the Jesuits, but were pardoned in 1993 under an amnesty law approved by the national assembly. The case was taken to Spain's National Court, because of its involvement in other high-profile human rights cases. The same Spanish court issued an arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998, while he was in a London hospital. For the rest of his life he fought legal battles -- first in England and later in Chile -- to avoid convictions. The Spanish court has also taken on human rights cases from other countries, including Argentina and Guatemala, testing a relatively new international legal principle known as Universal Jurisdiction. It contends that if justice for human rights abuses is not served in the country where the crime occurred, then a court in another country can intervene. The groups filing suits are the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability and the Spanish Association for Human Rights. Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said. It could take the National Court weeks or even months to determine if it will accept the case.	1
While an art student at Dumlupinar University, Turkish illustrator Murat Palta watched "Star Wars". As with the generations of fans that preceded him, he was struck by the film's epic quality. Though the movie is  not as big a spectacle as Hollywood, or even the Star Wars books, Palta used the format to convey a sense of awe and wonder, of a deeper reality and of a profound beauty.This was Palta's introduction to the medium of 3D art. "I was just very interested in the films' form. I would create these little illustrations and would give them to my friend to put in his books," says Palta. Later he moved onto other art forms such as animation. He has recently been working on a series of drawings from the perspective of ancient Egypt, in a project that aims to recreate some of our best-loved movies.Dumlupinar University, founded in 1780, has had a long history of art. The school's alumni include some of the greatest painters of the 20th century such as Alexej Tolstoy and Alexander Archipenko.Palta graduated in 1994 and quickly fell in with the scene in the media. He has been painting art ever since.The New York Times describes him as an "illustrator, painter and comic book creator" and "a master of the art of the computer", where his work has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Palta's early interests lay with comics, and he remembers drawing the covers of The Mighty Atom comic book when he was in elementary school.He became interested in the film industry when watching "Star Wars". So you might have guessed he was an avid fan when we met and posed for one of his drawings.There is an art school in Turkey called Fenerbahce University. And this is where I visited Murat Palta last week. But what has Palta's work to do with the university? "The art school that I graduated from is an art school that was founded in 1720 because it's a university that is a university that is associated with fine art, or the fine arts. I graduated from it in 1994."I've been drawing for as long as I can remember, and	0
European champions Spain were drawn with 2004 semifinalists the Czech Republic as they begin the defense of their title this year in qualifiers for the 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Vicente del Bosque's team were placed in one of three five-nation groups on Sunday, being the last out of the hat, with the other six pools featuring six teams. The nine group winners qualify automatically along with the best runner-up and the two hosts, with the other eight second-placed sides facing playoffs in November 2011. Spain and the Czechs, the 1996 runners-up, are in Group I along with Scotland, Lithuania and minnows Liechtenstein, with the first qualifiers to be held in September this year. In the other five-nation pools, England are the top seed in Group G and will have to get past 2008 co-hosts Switzerland, the unpredictable but talented Bulgaria, Wales and Montenegro. Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, quarterfinalists in 2008 and losing finalists at home in 2004, were drawn in Group H with 1992 champions Denmark, Norway, Cyprus and Iceland. World champions Italy also face a testing time in six-nation Group C after being drawn with Serbia and Slovenia, who have both qualified for this year's World Cup finals and will be seeking to continue that progress. Three-time champions Germany were drawn in Group A with Turkey, who they beat in the 2008 semifinals before losing to Spain. Neighbors and that year's co-hosts Austria are also in the same group along with Belgium, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Netherlands, ranked third in the world behind Spain and Brazil, should be confident of qualifying from Group E ahead of Sweden, with Finland, Hungary also battling for a runner-up spot ahead of minnows Moldova and San Marino. Two-time champions France are again drawn with Romania, who failed to qualify from their 2010 World Cup pool but made it through to Euro 2008. Bosnia-Herzegovina, beaten by Portugal in the World Cup playoffs last year, were also drawn in Group D. Russia failed to qualify for the World Cup in South Africa, but are joined in Group A by a team who did as pool winners, Slovakia, and the Republic Of Ireland -- who lost a controversial playoff to France made infamous by Thierry Henry's handball.

Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country's history. Morgan Tsvangirai's ills have created a political vacuum. As president, Mugabe has been largely powerless to deal with the country's worsening economic crisis and soaring inflation rate. He has struggled to balance economic austerity and the need for Zimbabwe's economy to be "modernized."Moyo, 37, was elected as speaker over the ruling Zanu-PF party's candidate and former deputy army chief of staff General Constantino Chiwenga. The parliamentary vote was held on the final day of the parliamentary sitting, and was expected to pass.The election was considered a referendum on Mugabe's leadership, and not on party affiliations. The vote was also seen as a vote of confidence in Tsvangirai, who is the head of the Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC-led opposition coalition, and who lost his bid for vice president after a court ordered the vote to be cancelled. The party leadership says Tsvangirai's candidacy was illegal under electoral laws that required a minimum of 40 percent support to be elected as vice president.Moyo would become the first opposition speaker in Zimbabwe's history. The first such opposition speaker was Andrew Young, an anti-apartheid activist and former CIA analyst who served as assistant secretary of state for African affairs under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1983.Moyo said he voted in favor of his party's candidate, Chiwenga. Tsvangirai's party accused him last month of having voted for Chiwenga because he had supported his candidacy to replace Mugabe as vice president.The opposition has been struggling to replace Tsvangirai with someone who offers the country greater financial stability. Tsvangirai has spent the past two years campaigning for a better, more stable currency for the country, and pushing through a series of economic reforms, which he argues will create greater financial stability. Tsvangirai has been working with Western governments, which have supported Zimbabwe's economic reforms, to create a stable currency that would help Zimbabwe's exports. The country's current currency, the Zimbabwean dollar, is highly unstable and has lost some 97 percent of its value in the past two years.The United States has offered Zimbabwe's	0
After months of questions and pressure from whistle-blowers, academic reform groups, the public and members of Congress, the NCAA has decided to reopen its investigation into The University of North Carolina over its so-called paper class scandal. ÂThe NCAA’s decision to reopen the scandal came after a meeting with UNC President Roy E. Disney and his legal counsel on Tuesday morning where the investigation was re-opened, along with other investigations.The decision to re-open the investigation could leave UNC without a contract with the NCAA or a bowl game appearance in the NCAA’s upcoming season after it lost a major lawsuit that could have kept the school from playing in college athletics altogether.“We cannot be made to walk by walking into a court of law,” Disney and his legal counsel said in a joint statement.While UNC officials were quick to say that they will stay with the plan for a one-year bowl ban, some of the key players on the NCAA’s investigation have already begun talking about a potential lawsuit.Â Â“I don’t want to go to court, but if there is a decision on whether we go forward or not, I think there is a chance of a lawsuit,” UNC Chancellor Holden Thorp said. “I’m not interested in being here until it’s resolved, but I’m interested in not going forward until it’s resolved.”The NCAA said it will revisit the issues of academic fraud, fraud within the paper class system, academic misconduct, academic dishonesty, and student athletics misconduct.“This will help us determine whether we should continue to enforce rules and regulations that would ensure the integrity of the sport,” NCAA executive vice president of operations Chris Thorne said in a statement.“The NCAA will continue to work diligently to uphold the most stringent rules, penalties and sanctions that ensure each institution’s full compliance with NCAA membership. That includes upholding the integrity of our most recent investigation,” he added.The potential suit, of course, could put the NCAA in the position of having to choose between a one-year bowl ban or an indefinite lawsuit filed by the school.“It’s just one example of people taking an issue into their own hands when they really don’t have all the facts,	0
The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases. In a 5-4 decision, the justices affirmed conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases blamed for global warming are pollutants. Although it concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency could not completely extend its regulatory authority for limiting the expansion or building of new facilities like power plants. The ruling, on a case seen as a major test of executive authority, gave both sides of the politically charged debate some reason to celebrate. But it also may have the longer term effect of extending legal fights for years. Many conservative groups have characterized President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of Congress. Industry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure. Businesses worry any unchecked expansion of rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. The court agreed to some extent. Justice Antonin Scalia said the "EPA's rewriting of the statute was impermissible." But the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end, since EPA can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases. "EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case," said Scalia. The agency responded positively to the decision. "Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations," it said in a statement. The government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal-fired plants. And the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry. Obama earlier this year announced new rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted him to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing Obamacare reforms, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act.	1
The children keep asking when their mother is coming home. Lee Khim Fatt doesn't know what to tell them. It's been more than three weeks since his wife, a flight attendant on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, disappeared along with 238 others when the jet vanished mid-flight. "I told them mummy's going to take a bit longer to come home this time, and I even promised them I'm going to bring her home," Lee says. His eyes fill with tears as he explains his plight. It's a promise he's not sure he can keep. "I really don't know where she is now," he says, "and now I am not sure whether I could bring her home." Lee and his wife, Foong Wai Yueng, shared a happy life together, raising their 10-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son. They met 20 years ago when she was just 19. He was her first boyfriend. Without her, Lee says he's lost his direction. An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world. The destinations were different, he says, but her returns home were always the same. "Every time she came back, definitely she got something for the kids," he says. "This is what she loved to do." Quest for answers Dozens of anguished relatives Sunday demanded that Malaysian authorities provide them with evidence of the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777. "We want evidence, we want truth and we want our family," they chanted at a news conference outside a Kuala Lumpur hotel. While many of the passengers' families are staying together in hotels, Lee remains at his home waiting for information about the missing flight. On Sunday, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned up fresh potential clues as an Australian aircraft spotted four orange objects in the water. But investigators haven't yet confirmed whether the objects were from the airliner, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Lee said he hears from Malaysia Airlines just once or twice a day, by phone or text message. He's angry at how the airline has handled the ordeal. Even though his wife was part of the cabin crew, he says he gets more information from the media than the airline. He watches the near-daily press conferences on television.	1
ISON, the most closely watched comet in recent years, may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun. Comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that can be iced up by sunlight and survive just long enough for Earth to view them becoming a spectacular spectacle. But Comet ISON won't be reaching perihelion this weekend, where it will come closest to the sun, until March 3-4.Perihelion is the point in the orbit of a comet where the comet and the sun both are closest to each other. At perihelion, the sun lies about 60 degrees north of the comet and is so close to Comet ISON's orbit that the comet is visible to the naked eye. ISON is currently at the closest point of its orbit in March and may be able to make its closest approach.It is not the first time a comet has gotten close to Earth. In 2006, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 made what is thought to be its closest approach to our planet that year at perihelion, coming within 6,000 miles of Earth. But this comet is about 1,500 feet (400 meters) wide and more than 3 miles (7 kilometers) long, meaning it is not as close as some of its smaller, more average cousins.This video shows what it will look like when comet ISON makes its closest approach to the sun. [Video: This Is Comet ISON]Comet ISON was discovered in 1876, and its closest approach, on Dec. 20, 2018, was at perihelion. It is a little-known object, being a comet that has not been seen since it came into view in 1877. While astronomers are often excited about the prospect of first seeing a new comet, it is a long way from being seen.Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

A 50-year-old man accused of strapping a suspected explosive device around the neck of an 18-year-old woman near Sydney, Australia, earlier this month was arrested Monday more than 9,000 miles away, Australian law enforcement officials said. "The offender in this matter has been identified, and it's been confirmed that he traveled to the United States," New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters. Police said that a man broke into the Mosman, Australia, home of the woman, later identified as Madeleine Pulver, on August 3 and attached what she then believed to be a bomb. The woman spent 10 hours attached to the device before having it removed by police bomb technicians. Authorities later determined it had been inert. The case subsequently drew intense media attention in Australia, and prompted police to launch an extensive investigation. That probe led to the arrest of the suspect around 3:30 p.m. EST (5:30 a.m. Tuesday in Sydney) in Louisville, Kentucky, by FBI agents working "very, very closely" with their Australian counterparts, said Scipione. "The information that I have is that the suspect was surprised" to be arrested, said Assistant Commissioner David Hudson. Australian police did not name the man arrested, noting that he hasn't been formally charged. But Hudson said that he is an Australian citizen who frequently traveled to the United States on business. He'd been in Sydney, which is his primary place of residence, for six weeks before flying to the United States on August 8, said Hudson. Hudson said that the man taken into custody was not yet a suspect when he went overseas. But "a fairly detailed chain of circumstantial evidence" -- including a description from the victim, even though the alleged assailant was "heavily disguised" -- ultimately led them to the United States and the arrest. There were "some links between the suspect and the family, however no direct links," said the assistant commissioner, though he declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation. The suspect is expected to be arraigned Tuesday morning in a U.S. court, said Hudson. Australian authorities plan to seek his extradition back across the Pacific Ocean. The alleged crime occurred in Mosman, a wealthy suburb about eight kilometers (five miles) from Sydney where many well-connected people, sports stars and celebrities live, resident and Australian news reporter Dave Kirwan told CNN.	1
British authorities and environmental groups were welcoming the launch this week of the world's first biodegradable chewing gum, which they say could help save some of the millions spent on clearing up the mess ordinary gum  leaves in landfills.However, the environmental groups raised doubts about the suitability of the product for the purpose.The product was developed by Rowntree, part of the Reckitt Benckiser group that also has developed sustainable packaging for milk.Speaking at the launch, Rowntree chief executive Christopher Johnson said the world was facing what he called "a unique environmental problem"."Most people who buy chewing gum do it in a disposable manner, by putting the wrapper in their front pocket to take with them when they go to the toilet, or for that matter, any other time that they do not want to throw the wrapper away," he said.The product, which can be used once, was made from plant-based materials and also contained ingredients to help speed up the decomposition process.Image copyrightJasper Johnsons Image captionA new biodegradable gum has been launched by Reckitt Benckiser."We are very pleased that we are able to bring a product to market that will make a difference to our environment at a time that we are faced with a unique, enormous problem," Mr Johnson said.But he cautioned that the product was still in its early stages and had not received any commercial orders from customers who wanted the gum in their homes.The product, he said, was designed to be used once, but he conceded that the company could not commit to that. "If it is going to be used once, then it is going to be used once. It does not mean it is not going to be used twice and then again."Rowntree's launch came after the government signed a deal with the company to ensure the gum is used once rather than twice, as well as limiting the amount of litter that is created every year.The deal means the biodegradable gum would replace almost 30 million plastic bags used to collect waste at landfill sites, which can take up to 30 years to decompose.The government said the biodegradable gum was expected to be in use by the end of this year.Image copyrightEPAImage captionThe product was launched at the Gum Tree by The Mayor of	0
The New York Times on Saturday endorsed Christine Quinn, a Democrat, and Joseph Lhota, a Republican, ahead of the primary elections to determine who will run to succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The endorsements by the renowned newspaper could have substantial influence on the September 10 primary elections for each party. Quinn, the City Council speaker and one of seven Democrats in the primary race, "offers the judgment and record of achievement anyone should want in a mayor," the newspaper said. "She has shepherded through important laws protecting New Yorkers' health, safety and civil rights, including measures banning public smoking, protecting tenants and small businesses, and battling slumlords. She sponsored the sweeping 2007 legislation that made the city's exemplary campaign-finance laws even stronger," the Times endorsement said. The newspaper gave credit to two other Democratic candidates, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and former comptroller William Thompson Jr., but said the editorial board had already been set to endorse Quinn even before what they believed was her impressive performance in a debate Wednesday. "We are honored to have the endorsement of the New York Times. The endorsement makes clear that Christine Quinn hasn't just talked about being a progressive, she has a long record of fighting for New York's progressive values and she has delivered results every step of the way," said Mike Morey, spokesman for the campaign. According to the latest NBC 4 NY/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey released on August 16, de Blasio and Quinn are currently tied in the polls. If no candidate obtains the required 40% of the vote, the top two will hold a runoff on Oct. 1. The crowded Democratic field includes former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner. The Times called Republican candidate Joe Lhota, once right-hand man to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former chairman of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, "the best qualified of the three men seeking the Republican nomination for mayor." "Few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works. He was an expert budget director for Mr. Giuliani, and then became deputy mayor for operations," the Times said. "In 2011 and 2012, he ran the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which, under his leadership, recovered amazingly quickly from the damage done by Hurricane Sandy," the paper said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.	1
One of the most highly anticipated apps for Apple devices was made available on Wednesday. At least, until it wasn't. Google announced a Gmail app for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch that was designed to make it easier for the iphone user to manage their email from any Mac that has Google Mail installed.The Gmail app is free to download from the App Store, with a $30 price tag for what has the potential to be something of a game-changer for the Mac environment: it not only lets you read and create email messages on any Apple device, but it lets you compose messages on any Mac computer. You can also read email messages on any device, which is a feature that hasn't been offered yet: The iPad version will be available when it's ready.The original version of the app was released in March, and that version offered the ability to save Gmail messages in the cloud – and since both versions are free and were both made available on Wednesday, there's really no earthly reason for anybody to be mad.The new version adds the ability to save a Gmail message as a draft, which can be viewed or opened anywhere that supports Drafts – the ability to "open" a draft is not the same as actually opening the email. As for the app itself, it's not quite what most people think of when looking at "Mail," but it does have functionality and features in common with the version for Macs. You can view and compose a new email message, write an email reply to an existing message, attach a file to the current message, add the "Cannot Send" feature to the list of errors, and so on.The app also lets you read, archive, forward and reply to a message, all of which are features that the Mac version of the app does not offerWhen it comes to the interface, the basic Mail.app model has been largely unchanged since version 1.0. In terms of features, this version of the app is identical to the one for Mac computers. You can look up mail addresses by name, search messages by name and by subject, compose new email messages from the Address Book entry, and so on.Google says it created the new version after a period of internal testing. As it's free, there's little chance of anyone being upset. After all, Google was willing to take the risk with this one when it comes to email for the	0
Sweden's chase for what is widely suspected to be a submerged Russian submarine operating within its territorial waters can't help but remind older Swedes of the fact that, during the Cold War, Swedish waters were thought to be regularly  searched for Soviet submarines.When it came to Soviet submarines in Swedish waters, the nation was at once a target and a participant in what was an open act of war. On one hand, Sweden would be the loser in that war of words with no military action ever taken, and on the other hand, Sweden would be the winner of the Cold War-era game of Russian submarine hunt.The first act of the game took place as early as 1943.  Swedish newspapers were full of stories about supposed secret Soviet submarines, and in particular about submarine activities in Swedish waters that the Swedish naval forces were actively searching for.While Swedish ships were often spotted in the area in question, they never found anything, and some concluded that they had to be completely wrong.For the Swedish news media, however, that was not enough to have a reason to go on the hunt for Soviet submarines. When the Cold War officially started, the Swedish Ministry of Defense, under pressure after the Berlin air battle, had already made its first move when they began to place a naval surveillance system in the area of the southern Baltic sea where the Russian presence seemed to be strongest. With Soviet submarines at large within Swedish waters, the ministry realized that it could become a major player in this situation.For the first Swedish navy system to be fitted, the Ministry of Defense asked the chief architect of the System for the Analysis of Swedish Sea Areas, Dr.  H. M. Heddendorff, to come up with a plan to monitor the sea regions where there was the most evidence of Soviet submarine activity. Armed with his analysis and a picture of the likely behavior in both German and Swedish waters, Heddendorff came up with his design with the objective of detecting the Soviet submarines first, after which they would pass the data on to the other side.The system was a two-part network of radar systems placed in two different locations. The first was a system that would operate out of the Swedish Navy's headquarters in Stockholm, with a coverage that was said to be the largest of any naval surveillance system in history. The second would be an international system that would be positioned in Sweden's only sea area border with Germany, at the border	0
After just two hours and three minutes, John Isner stepped off the grass of Wimbledon's new No. 3 court a very relieved man on Tuesday. This time last year it took the American three days to win his record-breaking clash with Nicolas Mahut on court No. 18 in the longest match in tennis history, lasting just over 11 hours. Somehow fate conspired to have the duo drawn together again in the opening round, and the sporting world was watching to see if the agony would be repeated. That 2010 epic went to five sets, with the eight-hour decider won 70-68 by Isner. This time, however, Isner triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 7-6 (8-6) before daylight faded to earn a second-round meeting with Spanish 16th seed Nicolas Almagro. Federer, Djokovic through to round two "It wasn't easy but obviously it was considerably quicker than last time. I was happy how I played, especially in the third set," the 26-year-old told reporters. "I was thinking if I lost that set we probably wouldn't be able to finish, and then it would have been the match going into a second day and people would have been talking about maybe a third. "I'm glad they put us out on this court. I don't know if they wanted to tarnish the memory of what happened on Court 18. It was unlikely it would live up to that match. It's a huge relief." After the first set went to a tie-break, it looked as if another titanic serving battle was on the cards. But Isner broke the Frenchman in the fourth and sixth games of the second set, winning it in just 26 minutes. Mahut had the chance to reduce the deficit after breaking in the third game of the third set, but Isner repaid the favor and had the edge in the tie-break to win it in 50 minutes. By comparison, last year's match featured 215 aces to 16 this time, 490 winners to 72, 91 unforced errors to 26, and 980 points played to 201. It was 47th-ranked Isner's first match since losing a five-set thriller to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open last month, where Mahut fell at the same hurdle.	1
You almost have to feel sorry for President Obama. Almost. You know you're having a tough week when you're essentially being called untruthful by, of all people, Bill Clinton, who knows a thing or two about stretching the truth. At Â£8 billion Â£12 billion is a lot of money, particularly when the bulk of it goes to cover the cost of a two-year-old budget deficit. But, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Â£4 billion a week is a lot of money.ÂThe IMF's latest economic forecasts are that Britain would lose a quarter of the £4 billion a week. This is what it found"As I look back over the past year, I can say that Britain has made big strides - especially in reducing the deficit. And we have also made significant progress in reducing unemployment and increasing employment. I think the UK is now on track to see unemployment fall to under 7 per cent by 2014/15, which would be good for the economy and good for our citizens."Oh, how nice. A good ole boy like Bill Clinton would never even dream of saying that the recession is over, but the fact he can't help himself is what shows you just how bad things really are. No wonder there are calls for a referendum on the budget and the budget deficit. Why aren't we having one now? Perhaps there's a lot of us out there that will be voting Labour this time next year.How would the Labour Party feel if they had to tell their voters that they'd be giving in to the demands of big business and the unions?ÂIt's not a question of giving in, though it would be easier to do so if the public were not being whipped up into such a frenzy by our own government. What it really boils down to is whether or not those in authority are prepared to listen to the views of the public. We've had a big row about the cost of the Olympics over the summer - we've had a big row about our energy bill, over the past few months - and now we're on a roll where, like it or not, we're having to listen to the views of the people of Britain. The big question for the future, however, is whether or not our rulers will even listen to us.ÂWhat do you want to happen?ÂHere's what you want	0
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has welcomed the return by Australia of two ancient Hindu art treasures that were allegedly stolen from temples in Tamil Nadu. During a meeting with Modi in New Delhi  following the return, Australia said that it had a special relationship with India. "Australia is extremely grateful for the return of these priceless relics of our rich Hindu heritage, and of India's heritage to the world," he said."I would like to assure the Australian people that our special relationship with India has never been better. As one of our very dear friends, Australia is a permanent, strong and steady friend of India," Modi was quoted as saying. The two treasures were returned to Australia on Sunday evening by its diplomatic mission in New Delhi. The two ancient Indian sculptures were reportedly taken to Melbourne as a part of a consignment of ancient Indian art sent to Australia."The sculptures were returned to Australia in accordance with the protocol set by the Consulate General of Australia in New Delhi," the press release by the Indian mission said. "This was followed by bilateral consultations, where Australia is being assured of full cooperation to safeguard the safe return of these invaluable items," it said.In a statement on Sunday, the Indian mission said that it had lodged a complaint with the Australian Consulate in Chennai seeking recovery of the artifacts and a compensation of Rs 25 lakh. Speaking to the media at his New Delhi residence on Monday, Modi commended India's international partners who helped bring the treasures back to India. He thanked the Australians for their help and expressed happiness at the opportunity of bringing back these historical artifacts."I am very grateful that Australia came back with the ancient Indian artefacts recently. This is a very happy occasion for all Indians. We will take this opportunity to restore the glory of India to the whole world," he said. On his part, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commended India's diplomatic mission in her country for the return of the artifacts. "We are very proud of Australia and how it has come back with the relics of India's ancient heritage," she said.She said the return of the artefacts was a tribute to India's diplomatic commitment to ensuring the safe repatriation of cultural heritage. On Monday, she met senior Indian diplomat here to discuss bilateral issues, among them, the return of the statues.According to the Indian Press reports, when the statues were brought back to Chennai after five years of being missing, the then Indian envoy to	0
As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event. Two dozen teams will pound ute’s in a bid to earn the right to play in the Rio Olympics in 2016. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) are eager to see more interest from the public towards the sport and their desire to bring more nations and teams to the games. With this in mind, we spoke with rugby’s chief executive James Stacey to try to understand why he’s decided to push the global game into the Olympic spotlight.In the run-up to the Rio Olympics, James Stacey, the chief executive of UK Rugby and Australia’s chief executive Andrew Farrar have issued public statements insisting that the world of sport should not be left behind when it comes to Olympic competition.While both men are well-known for the high-profile role that they play in the commercial side of sports, it’s the less public role that they have had with international governing bodies that is interesting.For as long as British rugby has existed, the governing body has been the British and Irish Lions, and Stacey has been on the board of the organisation for 20 years.But the other international governing body that Stacey is keen to push into the Olympic arena, is the International Rugby Board (IRB). Although the two organisations have been friends for some time, the IRB have only been a member of the International Rugby Football Board for seven years, and they have only held full membership since 2014. The IRB have often been involved with British rugby over the years, but they only decided to officially become a part of UK Rugby six months ago.For Stacey, the IRB is a chance to use their new status to show the world how much greater their game is, and how important they are to the future of the game on this planet.“I wouldn’t like to be on the other side of the argument – I think it’s a great opportunity to use the global game as an Olympic story, and to get the two games going,” says Stacey. “If we can get the IRB in and show the world how incredibly important rugby is to the Olympics and the World Cup, I’m very excited.”	0
Tensions between police and marauding gangs continued into Tuesday in areas of Great Britain, after violence initially sparked by the shooting death of a 29-year-old man in London spread to other parts of the nation. The number of people killed over a third day of unrest was on course to rise into the hundreds, with at least six people so far injured, but London police said they had made progress in restoring calm. "There are now less than 20 people killed and about 200 injured in the last 24 hours (Tuesday)," a spokesperson said.Listed in order of descending probability.What is the probability that all three of these events occur in the same order?  1 2 1 2 5The correct answer is  4.Use the formula:  *  *  *   *  *   *   *How would you know that the probability of two events occurring in the same order is   ?

Barack Obama's two daughters had another reason to high-five their dad's election to the presidency Tuesday night: they're getting a puppy. President Bush's dog  Barney walks in the White House Rose Garden in 2007. "Sasha and Malia," Obama said in his victory speech at Chicago's Grant Park, "I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House." The new White House pet will follow in the paw-steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue over the years. The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site. The Clintons' Washington stay included a cat, Socks, who did not get along with their chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy. And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as "told to" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W. Bush. While many presidents took to heart President Harry Truman's admonishment -- "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog" -- first pets have come in all shapes, sizes and species. Thomas Jefferson kept two grizzly bears in a cage on the White House lawn, while John Quincy Adams is said to have let his alligator use a bathtub inside. Calvin Coolidge walked his raccoons on a leash. Theodore Roosevelt's sons escorted their pet pony onto the White House elevator to cheer up a sick sibling. And perhaps the strangest of all: Martin Van Buren briefly owned two tiger cubs, a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Pets have sometimes been a boon to a president's image. But some have also taken a bite out of their popularity. Animal lovers howled in protest when Lyndon B. Johnson picked up his beagles, Him and Her, by the ears to provide photographers a better view. On the other hand, Richard Nixon -- running for vice president and accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions -- successfully defended himself in his famous "Checkers Speech." The only gift he ever accepted was "a little cocker spaniel dog" that his daughter named Checkers, Nixon said.	1
Two tank barges loaded with light crude oil struck a bridge in the Mississippi River early  on Friday morning, causing a traffic jam at a bridge in the St. Louis suburb of Kansas City.At least two barges carrying gasoline oil struck the bridge at 7:35 a.m., according to Kansas City Police Sgt. Dave Skaggs, who added that he could not immediately confirm the number of injuries, saying he could only get information from fire departments at the scene. It was not known what caused the bridge to collapse.A fire department spokesman said at least several ambulances responded to the call and that 11 people had been taken to area hospitals.There was no immediate word on the total number of casualties. In the past, such accidents have caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage to infrastructure and a huge amount of traffic jam. Several barges have been toppled in Missouri in recent years, including one that tore through a bridge over the Missouri River. Officials in Kansas City responded to one such accident in 2013, killing nine people.The accident was the first known incident in Missouri involving barges carrying crude oil this week. Missouri has an estimated 20,000 barge traffic this year, Skaggs said.In the past, many oil barges have found themselves in precarious situations. In 2009, the MV Robert and Martha Huggins collided just off the coast of Louisiana, causing a spill that killed 20 dolphins.Some sources said the barges were not carrying much oil, but others noted that the barges are often found floating on the tops of the Mississippi River in small concentrations.At least two accidents in recent years have resulted in barges overturning in Missouri, killing several people and damaging the barges’ hulls. In 2007, an accident off the coast of Grand Isle killed one person on a shrimp boat. In 2011, a barge carrying crude oil overturned about 100 miles off the coast of LaPlace on the Mississippi River. That accident resulted in a spill that contaminated water flowing into Lake Pontchartrain.“These barges should be inspected regularly,” said Mike Shaneyfelt of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group.On Friday, the Coast Guard said its teams were on the scene and were looking for any boats or barges that may have been involved.	0
The Bank of England knowingly helped to sell looted Nazi gold from occupied Czechoslovakia months before the outbreak of World War II, according to experts. On Tuesday the Bank of England's archives -- published digitally for the Â£6.8bn first Â£700bn of private research by the nation's taxpayers through their digital archive -- were made available not in printed form but in a searchable digital format.In a searchable digital archive, the Bank of England is no longer the exclusive custodian of an official archive of documents which the Bank of England's former chairman and current governor, Sir John Snare, says were 'grossly misrepresented'. The archive published by the Bank in March 2015 was Â£1.2bn in size and was used to sell a secret plan for how to avoid the consequences of World War II if Nazi gold and other assets were returned to Czechoslovakia in the event of defeat.The archive revealed that the Bank of England had told a secret committee, set up by the Bank in the spring of 1939 for the purpose of seeking to arrange the re-distribution of assets after the Second World War, that they believed the return of Czech gold would be advantageous to the UK and the Czechs. 'It had been agreed by a confidential committee for consultation that it was desirable that at the outset of the war, in the Czechoslovakian zone of occupation, this country should transfer to the Government of Czechoslovakia the gold and other assets of the Nazis which were or had been in its possession or under its control which had not been handed over immediately to the Czechoslovak Government after the Germans took over these assets in 1938,' says the archive.Despite the advice of the Bank of England's committee, which was established on 9 March 1939 to consider the distribution of assets after the Second World War, the Bank went on to secretly prepare a secret memorandum which, when published on 1 February 1942, explained to the Czechoslovak authorities how the Bank had suggested that the assets could be transferred without the need for UK or Czech Government consent.The memorandum is titled 'Suggestion That War Assets, Which Have or Have Occurred in the Czechoslovakian Zone of Occupation, Might be Transferred to the Governments of Czechoslovakia or of Czechoslovakia and Nazi Germany.' The memorandum -- which was published by the Bank in its public archive in March 2015 -- explains that: 'It was agreed that the	0

Over the past week, I've been inundated with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and e-mail. So this week I'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you shouldn't freak out. The most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided. 1. Hasn't swine flu been around for a while? Yes. Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, got swine flu. From 1976 until 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one report every year or two of humans with swine flu. From December 2005 until January 2009, there were 12 cases of swine flu reported. 2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people? It appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and "we're not finding that linkage here." 3. Swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does that happen a lot? Yes. More than 200 "zoonotic diseases" are transmitted from animals to humans, including illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (better known as "mad cow disease") are two well-known examples. 4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico? Yes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning.  Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions » 5. Should I be freaking out? A new virus spreading quickly around the world. Young, healthy people struck dead in Mexico. Should we all be panicking?	1
It started out as a lovely summer night in northern California: an outdoor concert at a winery that's set among redwoods and that bills itself as "miles away but worlds apart." But Thursday's show by the band The utes was anything but pleasant, and the audience seemed to be equally divided, but for one thing: a "wonder" wine bar with a long, long, long, long line that stretched for a full mile.To understand the situation, which is not surprising for a crowd that got there 40 minutes early, we talked to the proprietor, who said that he was in the wine business for nearly 30 years, and he knew how to get people in and out in record time."We need to do something like this every now and then," he said.It was hard to imagine such a line at a winery, and one of the first things you wonder about when you walk in is if it's worth the wait. But wineries in California always ask for a $2 deposit, and the owner at this winery, which is just over the hills from San Francisco, said he paid $30 for the ticket, and that seemed to give them more trust than if you asked for $16.So how do you do it?You first, or maybe second, look to see if the sign at the bar is up.That's what we did in the Napa Valley, our first stop in the Napa Valley wine country, which is one of the most famous in the world. We had a small group, and we went to the Napa Valley, which is an hour from downtown and is very famous. We saw a lot of interesting things and we saw some impressive wineries, and then we had to get back to the hotel and get ready to make the next stop.It was only three blocks to that winery, Napa Rose Cellars. It's a very small winery, and very nice. The winery was owned by two sisters that also own Blue Hill, and it's a beautiful place. It's in Napa County, which is like the other end of the Napa Valley, and we really liked the winery.When we walked in, there were a very long line, about 25 people deep. And the person who is in charge of the wine, Roberta Sommese, explained that they have	0
Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on February 24, 2010, a SeaWorld Orlando trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park's killer whales. The death of Dawn Brancheau was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to Dawn --  family and friends -- and one that also served as a catalyst for change.Dawn Brancheau was a SeaWorld Orlando trainer who was an integral part of a program called "Ocean Rescue" that involved training killer whales to save injured park animals that couldn't be released due to injuries or other problems that could endanger the public.The trainer had trained killer whales before, but this was the first time she and her husband, Paul Brancheau, had trained them together and it was her first time training a killer whale, according to SeaWorld Orlando.Her training methods included teaching the whales to go where they wanted to go and getting to know each and every one of their individual idiosyncrasies."Paul and Dawn were really great friends and I had just seen Dawn work for Paul on a few of the larger whales that live at the park," said Jim Gorman with the International Association of Zoos and Aquariums, "They were great trainers, a really great team, and it was a wonderful thing to work with them."The following is a statement from SeaWorld Orlando as it marks the one-year anniversary of Dawn Brancheau's tragic death and the loss of her beloved killer whale, Soot, who was with her when she died.We are deeply saddened by Dawn Brancheau's loss and extend our sincerest condolences to her loved ones who mourn the loss.The Brancheaus' daughter, Jessica Brancheau, who is a teacher at Ocean Springs School and is still receiving counseling after the accident, shared the following on Facebook early yesterday morning:My mother loved Soot (a killer whale) the most, and he will always have a special place in her heart. The last time I saw her alive was at the zoo. Mom will be really missed. Love you Mom and I miss you. JessicaDawn Brancheau was a beloved trainer for the park's killer whale tank, but for a variety of reasons, including the park's decision to take a hard political stance against killer whales, she was unable to keep her job.The Brancheaus' daughter,	0
It's a revolutionary decree. In the midst of the fight against Islamist rebels seeking to turn the clock back to the 7th century, a Kurdish region in Syria has just approved a new law ordering equality for women. Take that, ISIS! The  Islamic State has been defeated, at least for the moment, but the country it is trying to rule, and its Islamist fighters, remain potent threats to the region and the world.Turkey, meanwhile, is on the move. With the United States on the side of the Kurds and Syria on the side of Turkey, the country may finally win its battle against these foreign fighters. But the fight will be far from over. Many Syrians will never forgive the Turkish government for letting them become foreign fighters. And the Islamic State will never be defeated. And a new caliphate will spring up somewhere in the Middle East, and we are likely the first to know.If you find yourself in a position where you don't know which side to take as the Syrian civil war rages on, I have a simple suggestion. Go to Syria. Walk among the people. Listen to the language. Watch the people. And visit the holy land of Islam. After a decade of misery, despair, and bloodshed, the Syrian people are looking for something different; and that something is democracy.The first to speak out against the Islamic State's foreign fighters in 2014 was Zuheir, the Kurdish woman who founded a new school for girls in the rebel-held town of Tel Rumeida, north of the Kurdish capital of Irbil. A few weeks later, it was Syrian journalist Sari Zino—who is also Zuheir's sister—who went public with her concerns about the fighters' recruitment.The next year, Sari published another piece, this time in the Kurdish newspaper Roj, where she expressed the frustrations of a mother who has seen her daughter killed in the revolution. She said, "I have witnessed two of my daughters be captured by the Islamic State... because of my activism I was forced to flee with them to a different town. After that, my youngest daughter was taken to a very distant place, and she was killed."Sari Zino's story was a catalyst for a new civil war. One of the most brutal was in Kobani, the Syrian border town now under a siege by the Islamic State, where a total of some 400 fighters with foreign training have been	0
Joel Osteen is the senior pastor for the Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. It's America's largest congregation. His wife, Victoria Osteen, is the co-pastor there. Joel and Victoria Osteen appear on "Larry  War" with Tawny Kitaen, the mother of Joel's youngest son and the mother of Tamera Kitaen whom he is marrying in July.I'm a pastor of a church in Florida who is the co-director of the Pastor of the Year Awards Program. We also have a small program that helps at-risk youth. We were really thrilled to have Dr. and Mrs. Joel Osteen as finalists for the Pastor of the Year awards for that program. Dr. Joel is a big philanthropist and his family is huge. They have three daughters who are pastors as well. We are so happy to have had them involved. We also are working to help kids have fun at their school because it is so painful to have a child who is going to be in the same situation that they were in when they were younger.The first time I saw Joel Osteen was when he was on Oprah Winfrey's show in 1996. That was his first major TV appearance. I saw him on the Oprah show for two hours in December of that year. If I didn't know who Joel Osteen was, I would have called him Joel. We got an invitation to go to a Christmas party in Houston with the family. Joel was there and we sat at the table where he was sitting in the front row. I saw his eyes fill with tears when I told him they were going to miss him that night. That was the first time I met him and had that opportunity to sit next to him.In 2011 I was asked to preach at a church in Lakewood, Texas, at the home church of Dr. and Mrs. Joel Osteen. They showed their love by inviting me to stay there and work with them for two weeks. I love Lakewood. It's a wonderful place. Lakewood Church had a great season of music that year. It was my second time.The music is very joyful. It’s a joy to see how God has given music the ability to touch a lot of people. And the music that Joel Osteen does is joy. It’s a joy to watch Joel Osteen live. The music is so full of joy and	0
When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service. They call the country's version of Marlon Brando, a heartthrob in the 1980s and 90s who turned his back on the ills of the world.It's been called the "Heart of Asian Medicine" and it's as influential as yoga in the fight against heart disease and stroke.More than 6,000 patients a year receive treatment at the country's only major mobile blood bank.At least 20,000 patients a year are treated at the country's only major mobile ophthalmology center where there are no eye doctors to be seen."The system is so designed, its so comprehensive and the country has so much expertise, so it's not just the doctors and nurses who are doing the work," said Dr. Mony Thura-Ying, the chairman of the medical committee at the Ministry of Health's Medical Services Department. "You have to understand, these people are used to having everything they need right here."All the hospitals run by the government are the first line of defense in getting people treated or recovering from ailments, such as malaria, flu and food poisoning."These facilities are the ones that are used by people in the communities," said Thura-Ying, the former chief of U.S. Naval Hospital in Rangoon, who is now in charge of the Health Ministry. "The hospital doctors go to the local doctors for advice and so on, and they get treatment from the doctors at the center."The doctors at the hospitals aren't just dealing with the ailments of the people in their area. They are also providing free medical aid to members of the armed forces, who go to their facilities for treatment — for what's known in Burmese as a "nurse-man's surgery.""The army comes for major surgery or trauma which would be otherwise difficult to get to the hospital," said Nyein, the doctor at U.S. Naval Hospital. "When the patients have been admitted, they are given a bed, so you have to know who to call."The nurses take care of them and after a day or two, when the patients need to go back to duty or travel for an operation, they call out their names and the nurses take them to the hospital."Every time, it's great	0
The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest. Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test-drive their stump speeches. On style, it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season. Marathon time For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, "the candidates" -- as they were called --  joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines. Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party. It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind. "It wasn't just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that," he said. Others were more blatant. "I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am," former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN. Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he'll make his decision before June. "I'm the one person who can make this country great again, that's all I know," he told reporters Saturday. "Nobody else can." Palin, in her remarks, was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader -- just not Hillary Clinton.	1
An October three-vehicle collision that left eight people dead in eastern Tennessee was caused by a blown front tire on a church bus, investigators said Monday. The bus was traveling east on Interstate 40 in Jefferson County, Tennessee, when the tire blew, causing the driver to lose control. The bus veered into the median and ran through a cable barrier before crashing into a Chevy Tahoe and tractor-trailer in the westbound lanes. "This tragedy was the result of blunt-force impact to the front tire that weakened its internal structure and caused the tire's failure. There was no evidence of any pre-existing condition to the tire," Col. Tracy Trott of the Tennessee Highway Patrol said. He added that there is no evidence any of the drivers in the crash were impaired or distracted. There was also nothing to indicate the bus wasn't well-maintained, he said. The bus, which was owned by Front Street Baptist Church in Statesville, North Carolina, was carrying 18 passengers, five of whom were ejected and killed. Another died inside the bus, while one of the three occupants of the Tahoe died, as did the tractor-trailer's driver. The bus was carrying a group of seniors on their way back home from a religious conference. The group was called "Young at Heart," pastor Rick Cruz said at the time. They were returning home from the 17th annual Fall Jubilee conference in Gatlinburg after three days of preaching and singing. "We do know that there were several that went on to be with the Lord," Cruz told his congregants during a sermon after the crash.	1
Overprotective sister? Underprotective husband? No one knows what was said amongst Solange Knowles, Jay Z and Beyonce in that elevator in the Standard Hotel in Manhattan or even what led up to the video that appears to show Solange kicking and hitting her brother-in-law. But here is what we do know: the Internet is on fire with theories. Earlier this week, an elevator surveillance video surfaced that showed Solange appearing to berate Jay Z before she becomes physical. Her sister, Beyonce, is present and witnesses the attack. The incident has inspired a hashtag, #WhatJaySaidToSolange, countless memes and tons of speculation. Quoting an anonymous source, Us Weekly reported that Solange Knowles had an earlier run-in with designer Rachel Roy. (Roy is the ex-wife of Damon Dash, Jay Z's former friend and business partner.) The New York Daily News, also using an unnamed source, took it one step further. In addition to the alleged argument with Roy, the paper threw in Jay Z's supposed desire to head solo to a party being given by Rihanna. This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister. Talk show host Wendy Williams also offered her own observations, including what appears to be the removal of a tattoo on Beyonce's finger of the roman numeral "IV." It was reportedly her wedding ring tattoo, meant to symbolize both her wedding date (April 4) as well as her and Jay Z's birthdays (September 4 and December 4, respectively). So far, some of the principal characters seem to be letting Instagram speak for them. Beyonce has posted happy pictures of her and her sister, while Solange participated in "Throwback Thursday" with a picture of the two siblings as kids. Even Dash has gotten in on the photo game, posting an old picture of Solange with a group and the caption: "Forgot about this one @ava_dash @atrak and solange ... I am actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a fighter #festivallife." The mystery continues.	1
Painfully hot, they make your eyes water, your heart race and can turn your face embarrassingly red. Chilies have been used for many millenia both for their medicinal benefits and exciting falvor. Once only a staple of cuisine from far flung regions of the world, chilies can now be found in almost any dish around the globe. Last week an Indian woman wolfed down 51 "ghost chilies," -- the world's spiciest -- in two minutes and smeared the seeds on her eyes for an entry into the Guinness World Records. Anandita Dutta Tamuly, 28, achieved the bizarre and fiery undertaking in the Indian north-eastern state of Assam. She was cheered on by British chef Gordon Ramsay, who also attempted a bite of the hot stuff before begging for water. A single seed can cause watering eyes, as well as a burning sensation in the mouth that can last up to five hours. A chili's spiciness is measured in Scoville units; the number of times a chili extract must be diluted in water in order for it to lose its heat. The "ghost chili", also known as bhut jolokia, has more than 1 million Scoville units, while Tabasco sauce ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville units and jalapeno peppers from 2,500 to 8,000 units. Chilies have formed part of the diet in the Americas since approximately 7,500 BC and owe most of their fame to their sometimes unbearably spicy flavor. But they have also long been recognized for their health benefits. Scientific research --and legend--  have attributed health wonders to chilies over the years. Diego Alvarez Chanca, a physician on explorer Christopher Columbus' second voyage to the West Indies in 1493, first wrote about the pepper's medicinal effects back in 1494. Below we look at effects eating chilies has on the body. Skin Other than for its flavor-enhancing qualities, chili is, oddly enough, used to fight the summer heat. As the chili causes extreme sweating and blood rushing to the face, it cools the body down when the sweat evaporates, making it useful for combating heat. These same heat inducing properties are said to have a cumulative effect and over time are believed to alleviate pain when used in treatments for anything from arthritis and psoriasis to shingles and severe burns.

Just moments after Mitt Romney triumphantly introduced Congressman Paul Ryan to American voters on the deck of the battleship USS Wisconsin, I happened to witness a heart-wrenching event on the tarmac of an airport hundreds of miles away: The casket of a fallen service member was returning home to his family in Florida. As I stood silently with a group of passengers watching a small honor guard march to attention, the hearse backing up to the conveyor belt, and the grieving family members holding each other up, I was reminded again that a nation's foreign policy has direct impact on all our lives. If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war? How will the election reshape our policies toward the rest of the world? The selection of Ryan as Romney's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy, on the huge and growing national debt, and on the large number of Americans who, years after the start of recession, remain unemployed. Sensing Obama's vulnerability, Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there. But international conflicts have a way of intruding on the best agendas of American statesmen and political strategists. President George W. Bush did not expect 9/11 (crazy conspiracy theories aside), just as Obama had no idea that the Arab uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts, some of which confronted America's values against its alliances. We do know that whoever sits in the Oval Office will face tough decisions on Iran and Syria, two problematic countries that are likely to demand attention at or near the top of the foreign policy rundown. And, we know that when the next presidential term starts, as many as 68,000 U.S. service members may remain in Afghanistan. A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning. The Republican duo differs dramatically from Obama and Vice President Joe Biden when it comes to economic policy, but on foreign affairs it's hard to find a truly sharp disagreement on fundamental issues, despite dissimilarities in tone.	1
Orangutans and bonobos in one of North America's leading ape research centers are spending time high in their habitats  Tribeca, New York | Photo: APThe last time you visited the New York Botanical Garden’s monkey forest, you might have glimpsed a couple of male orangutans who were sitting around, looking up at a high wire fence — or possibly talking to each other about politics. This was in the late 1970s, when two scientists first climbed the forest’s tall trees and began filming monkeys for their book “ oracids, monkeys, and bananas. ”Today, the orangutans are gone, but the monkey forest’s research and conservation work continues in the absence of orangutans. Now the orangutans are back: As part of a $5 million project to restore the forest to its old state, primates from around the world are coming to New York, where they will live together to study how best we might preserve it.In February, scientists from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, the University of California, Davis, the American Museum of Natural History, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Natural History Museum of Denmark and Smithsonian, will arrive to help with the orangutan restoration. Once they’re happy with their progress, they’re likely to return to the site with the goal of growing the forest back to its once-glittering, tropical splendor.On this day, one of the world’s most famous creatures has come to the garden — the orangutan. “Most people don’t come here, and yet the orangutan is very, very well known,” says David L. Peterson, the garden’s president, who took over his family’s nursery business from his father in 1958.The first time I visited, the orangutans looked like they were enjoying their lunch — not at all interested in humans. But they certainly didn’t look agitated with humans or in any way threatened. And in a few months, maybe a year, my colleagues will be back here to see what happens.“How beautiful the orangutans are!” says one visitor. “It’s like seeing a picture of a rainforest!”The orangutans	0
While the Academy gets ready to crown the best films of the past year, we've got something else for your consideration. From "The Avengers 2" to "World War Z," CNN Entertainment presents your guide to  the best films you haven't seen.1. "The Avengers 2"From the moment a space shuttle disappears over the horizon, “The Avengers” is immediately a film about the people who go into space — and come back to Earth with a plan to right wrongs and do the right thing. It also finds its sweet spot in the Marvel universe when we learn (for the first time) that the “Avengers” are actually a team composed of the members of "The Avengers," played by our heroes in their superheroic glory. (Don’t worry, they even have a movie of their own, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.”) That’s not even considering the fact that the film’s title is now a throwback to the original, all-star super-team of Marvel’s early days.That’s just a taste of how the film works as a whole, but that’s exactly what makes the film so much better than the first. And while we’re on that topic, the film takes time to put the superhero genre on pause — so that we can appreciate the more interesting aspects of the genre. The action sequences are great, but they never seem to be drawn out or overly complicated. The special effects and the makeup are very, very well done. And as the film comes to a close, we find ourselves rooting for our heroes to make the right decisions. The stakes are high, the characters are rich and complex, but the film never lets anything get out of control, and it never forgets to end with a moment when the genre is at its best.You can check out the rest of the movie’s cast below.2. "The Wolf of Wall Street"The director-stars of “The Wolf of Wall Street” are a couple years removed from their best-known film, “The Fighter,” which is something of a tribute to “Wolf” that’s fitting. But unlike the more recent “The Fighter,” “Wolf” has a better shot at being nominated for an Oscar than	0
First the attackers blew up bombs outside a Pakistani prison. Then they scared off people in the area and used loudspeakers to call out specific inmates they were trying to release. Shiite prisoners left inside were killed. "It was a well-planned assault," noted CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen, who provided details Monday of the July 30 prison break in northwest Pakistan. Other similar operations in the past two weeks in Iraq and Libya successfully freed hundreds of convicted or suspected Islamic terrorists, a known strategy of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Bergen and other analysts cited the prison breaks as one of several reasons the United States has dramatically heightened its security stance by issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing almost two dozen embassies and consulates on Sunday, with 19 of them remaining shut for the rest of the week. The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an "abundance of caution" over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week. 'Do something' An intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives in the last several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies, as well as the prison breaks. A message from al-Zawahiri to his second in command in Yemen told him to "do something," CNN has learned. U.S. and Yemeni officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in Yemen, so the message caused them to fear imminent terrorist action. CNN had the information over the weekend and decided not to report the details about al-Zawahiri's involvement based on U.S. government concerns about the sensitivity of the information. Now that it has been widely reported in other media, including the New York Times and McClatchy, CNN has now decided to report it as well. And U.S. officials cautioned that there may be multiple sources of intelligence, including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives. Opinion: What's behind timing of terror threat Asked Monday about the prison breaks, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf called them "a concern for the international community" that is "separate and apart" from the U.S. concern about the latest specific terrorist threat.	1
The future of social networking, the real-time Web and a host of apps and gadgets were the talk of the annual Le Web conference as it opened here Wednesday. The phenomenal success of microblogging site Twitter and its plans for the future dominated the two-day event's opening sessions for bloggers and industry leaders, held in a converted morgue in the city's northeastern suburbs. Top executives from Twitter faced off with rivals from Facebook and MySpace as all three social media sites unveiled technical innovations designed to capture more users. On the heels of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's unveiling of Square, a device that accepts credit card payments on cell phones, Twitter platform director Ryan Sarver said the site now has 50,000 dedicated applications making use of its constant stream of blog updates. Sarver also announced the company's "firehose" feature, which throws open its data stream to any developers who want to use it. This is a first for Twitter, which has yet to disclose any major revenue streams even as others use it to harvest profits. Facebook developer Ethan Beard touted his own site's 500,000 applications and its power to drastically boost hits to news sites such as The Huffington Post through the 60 million users it now claims for its Facebook Connect feature. Meanwhile, MySpace Chief Operating Officer Mike Jones announced that his site is incorporating real-time status updates to its platform -- like Twitter and Facebook -- amid MySpace's struggles to find an identity. Jones also announced unrestricted developer access to MySpace's content and a $50,000 innovation prize to attract developers, but refused to comment on rumors of a potential partnership with rival Facebook. The social networking execs declined to discuss their sites' revenues or widely rumored stock market flotations. Chad Hurley, co-founder of Google-owned YouTube, also refused to disclose company revenues but said some popular users have earned more than $1 million since advertising was introduced to the video-sharing site. "We didn't implement [advertising] initially on YouTube because we didn't want to skew the motivation of why someone would publish video. We wanted to be a video community," he told the conference. "We saw over time the opportunity to introduce that secure revenue without distorting what we've become, and we've been quite successful," he said. But Hurley said he had no secret formula for anyone wanting to create a viral sensation on YouTube.	1
The 2012-13 TV season is already a month old and, as expected, returning favorites have remained just that â€” favorites. Naturally, this year's best comedy winner at the Emmys remains in the Top 5 (way to go, Cam!), while Shonda Rhimes' trusty medical drama is still fighting the good fight for ABC.

The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity. After sunset, the only light in one corner cafe iced the street.It was one of the first nights in Tripoli since the capital plunged into darkness for several hours on Sept. 20, after a series of gas explosions in the oil fields of eastern Libya sank the entire facility – and prompted an evacuation of residents from the city.The energy crisis prompted the government to shut down the country’s nuclear plants for a month starting Oct. 21, the same day that Tripoli was scheduled to declare itself a federal capital. But the crisis appears to be easing thanks to repairs to a power plant in Egypt that began last month and could soon restore the rest of the country’s fossil fuel capacity.The power crisis has been widely reported in Tripoli, where only six of the eight daily newspapers are working. At press time, Tripoli had the lowest level of electricity demand per capita relative to the rest of the country, according to the World Bank.According to the Tripoli Electricity Company, the capital’s electricity company, there is not enough electricity to cover the needs of residents during peak periods. As a result, the company said that the daily average power demand per capita in the city has fallen from 5,543 megawatts on Oct. 31 to 4,500 megawatts on Nov. 10.Yet the situation is worse in the city where the average daily demand per capita was at 3,500 megawatts.“This is a very complicated situation,”said Mohamed El-Ghaly, a spokesman for the country’s government.El-Ghaly added that the situation was exacerbated by the fact that there was “lack of water,” and that even the power companies were struggling to get enough power to meet demand.“You need at least a day’s supply to be able to have a working power station,” El-Ghaly said.The energy cuts come as residents of the city and of other parts of Libya – including Benghazi, Misrata and Benghazi-Sirte – began to receive their electricity back on Sept. 30.The restoration of power to Libya’s cities is part of a larger battle between Gaddafi’s regime and his opponents	0
The BBC assembled a "We Are the World"-- style cast of globally famous musicians to sing the Beach Boys' "God Only Knows" with its 80-piece BBC Concert Orchestra for a spot promoting the network's newly launched BBC Music venture. The network has dubbed the ensemble -- which sings in a classically fantastical array of settings, from a jungle-scape on a stage to a hot air balloon -- the "Impossible Orchestra." Watch Brian Wilson, Weird Al, Conan cover George Harrison Pharrell Williams, Elton John, Lorde, Chris Martin, Brian Wilson, Florence Welch, Stevie Wonder, Brian May, One Direction, Chrissie Hynde, Baaba Maal, Dave Grohl and Sam Smith are among the dozens of performers who comprise the ensemble. "All of the artists did such a beautiful job, I can't thank them enough," Brian Wilson told The Guardian. "I'm just honored that 'God Only Knows' was chosen. 'God Only Knows' is a very special song. An extremely spiritual song and one of the best I've ever written." Lorde shares alluring 'Hunger Games' single 'Yellow Flicker Beat' "Once you start going into a song like we have been today, you come up on a new respect," Brian May said of the experience in a behind-the-scenes video, streaming here. "It's beautifully constructed, and quite enigmatic, really." The BBC has created a charity single of the song to raise money for its BBC Children in Need campaign. A physical copy of the CD is available for purchase in the U.K. and on Amazon, and it's also available for download and streaming. The BBC previously made a similar video in 1997, remaking Lou Reed's "Perfect Day." That campaign featured Reed, Bono, David Bowie, Burning Spear, Tom Jones and more. Elton John is the only performer to have appeared in both videos. See the original story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.	1
The story has all the stuff that sells: a sexy starlet, a powerful enemy spy agency and lots of bare flesh. Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the men's magazine FHM prompted Malik to threaten a lawsuit. Malik said FHM doctored photographs to show her without clothes. The magazine, however, denied those allegations. Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude. What made the photos even more scandalous was that Malik's upper left arm bears the letters ISI, the acronym for Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. In a legal notice served to the magazine, Malik contends that it was Sharma's idea for her to wear the painted on ISI tattoo; she was told t would be good for her image. And in another photo, which was originally slated for the cover, she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand. FHM published the grenade photo inside, with a line plastered across it: "The cover we didn't use." Sharma said the magazine opted not to use the photo on the cover because it "could have offended sensibilities." But the magazine has already incensed Malik. Lawyer Ayaz Bilawala told CNN that Malik is seeking $1.9 million in damages. Bilawala said the publication "cheated" his client and doctored the nude pictures. "Proceedings (in a court of law) will begin soon," he said. FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published. "The pictures that are on display are tampered with, morphed and doctored," he said. Bilawala didn't dispute the ISI print on Malik's left upper arm but said numerous organizations worldwide used the same acronym. He refused comment on the grenade-like object. FHM India hinted at countersuing the actress. "These allegations are completely and entirely false. We are exploring various other options, including filing a countersuit," Sharma told CNN. Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland. "What I am doing takes a lot of guts," she said. "If I had posed nude for the magazine, I would be the first to admit it. But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong.	1
Getting out of her car, the wife of a furloughed government worker walked toward a small building full of free food. She approached the door with her head down.

This week, the country witnessed one of the most irresponsible acts that we have seen from this Republican Congress, since they deliberately shut down the government less than a year ago. Republican House Speaker John Boehner informed President Barack Obama that he would not bring a vote on immigration reform to the floor this year. Whatever excuse Speaker Boehner has for abdicating his responsibility as a national leader, it is not good enough, and he has now given the President ample excuse to act on his own. Which he is now doing. Since Republicans in Congress refuse to do their job and allow a vote on comprehensive immigration reform this year, Obama, on behalf of the American people, is acting on his own to address this important issue -- for the well-being of our country, our economy and the immigrant community that has contributed so much to our economic growth and prosperity and is suffering greatly from a badly broken system. A family secret that changed his life Republicans had a year to either bring the Senate immigration bill to the House floor, or come up with an approach of their own that would deal with the different moving pieces necessary to fix our broken immigration system. Obama and Democrats were willing to compromise at every corner -- and despite disapproval from advocates and allies -- even held off on pressuring Republicans in hopes that would help create space for reform. But it didn't work. Opinion: Like those children, I too fled Central America No matter what they did, the GOP refused to move. Republicans chose to play politics and spew excuses, rather than honor the will of the majority of the American people and pass such needed reform. In 2013 they said they didn't have enough time in the legislative calendar to pass reform, but they did have time to shut down the government which cost us $24 billion. Then, Republican leadership announced they wouldn't move on immigration reform unless the majority of the Republican caucus supported it, even though the votes were there to pass reform and poll after poll showed the majority of the American people support reforming our immigration system. All of this while promising they would bring up legislation. Earlier this year we were encouraged by Republicans putting out their immigration principles -- which were less than ideal but which the President and Democrats were willing to discuss.	1
Work on the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been halted over a budgetary dispute, delaying its opening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. "There's no chance of it being  finished today," the mayor said at a Thursday evening news conference.New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the National September 11 Memorial Museum will be finished by 2010.New York's most notable cultural institutions are struggling to survive the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which killed at least 18 people in New York City.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which suffered the most damage, could have to move its entire European art collection, according to a report.The Met lost more than 30 of its 60 European paintings and sculptures.An employee of the Guggenheim's New York division, which has been in disarray since a fire in 2005 that destroyed its glass-enclosed main building, was arrested Thursday at the museum for stealing pieces.The Met also lost about two-thirds of its valuable collection of Chinese art, including works estimated at $10 million to $40 million, according to the news report, which said the collection was likely to be moved on Wednesday.The Met had hoped to move the collection to a newly constructed gallery in the museum's old east wing, rather than to a new building, but was unable to get a loan.The Met is also struggling to find an experienced curator to replace longtime museum director Stephen E. Pollock, who is leaving the museum in October after seven years.The Met has made a series of unsuccessful attempts to lure a prominent American curator to replace Pollock, including a $3 million offer from Britain's National Gallery, according to the report.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday the National September 11 Memorial Museum will be completed by next year.The National September 11 Memorial Museum will be a museum of "the people and the spirit of America," Bloomberg said.Bloomberg also said the museum will be free."I hope that when you hear that we're going to make it, you're excited about it, and you want to be part of it," he said.It's being called the National Museum of the American Hispanic Experience - a not-for-profit organization and not a museum.They've got a $40 million gift fund to build a museum on the ground floor of the World Trade Center site.The museum will give	0
Three people have been sentenced to death on Monday for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October, state television CCTV reported on its microblog. Another defendant Ƞeruiș from Sibiu, Romania, was sentenced to life in prison.A total of 19 people were sentenced from Monday to Sunday, state-run media reported.The victims of the attack were mostly local residents, and foreign students, but also foreigners – including one Swiss citizen. The youngest killed was 12, and the youngest of those who died was 23.On 7 October 2013 the Beijing subway system was put into lockdown following the shooting, with more than 100 injured and 10 dead. Later, a total of 15 people were arrested for their roles in the shooting.Among the victims were local residents and tourists, including four foreigners, including one Swiss citizen.The Beijing subway was then closed for three weeks, after which the government decided that it would be reopened to passengers, with more stringent security.The perpetrators are thought to have shouted anti-communist slogans before the attack, CCTV reported. Some of those responsible were still at large when the shooting took place.The two accusedJiang Zemin, the general secretary of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, announced on Friday 8 October 2013 that Jiang would step down as leader of the CCP and the world's leading communist party. Jiang will remain the party's general secretary to carry out his duties until the party congress, which will be held in October 2014.Before the announcement, Jiang told a press conference "I feel that the government of China has done a lot for the country and the whole world. The government has made great achievements in terms of economic development. The country is a peaceful and stable country. I believe that I should resign as party general secretary and party chief of the Chinese Communist Party" Jiang added that the CCP had worked hard to maintain good relations with the world since the Communist Party took power on 1 October 1949.Ji Shaoqing, a lawyer for the defendant Shaojun Yang, told the court "I have no personal grudge against him, and I didn't kill him, he is innocent.

In 1985, Meng Weina set up China's first private special needs school in the southern city of Guangzhou. As a single mother she was motivated to help those who are often overlooked by the country's health care system and stigmatized by society. From her first center in Guangzhou, Weina now has Hui Ling operations in a dozen cities across China providing a range of services, from kindergartens and primary schools to youth workshops and adult residential homes. The expansion of the donation-funded NGO shows not just the success of the Weina's vision but the desperate need for mental health care provision in China. "We estimate that only 10% of people with intellectual disabilities in China are receiving some kind of care or help," said Weina. According to a 2009 study published in British medical journal The Lancet, around 173 million Chinese suffer from a mental disorder. However there are only 20,000 psychiatrists, equaling 1.5 for each 100,000 people, or a tenth of the ratio in the United States. Mental health legislation Last year saw the introduction of China's first mental health legislation, which took a reported 27 years to pass. Among the changes from the law are new financing initiatives for mental health services and training for primary care-givers. Perhaps the most significant was a new set of rights for patients, including not being hospitalized against their will. Negative perceptions of those with metal health problems are often portrayed in the media in China; they are either victims or perpetrators of violence. Weina knows that each individual that comes to a Hui Ling center has their own set of needs and unique personality, and helping bring out their best encourages her to keep working. "I wanted to do something to make my life worth while," said Weina. "When I see the smiles on their faces, when I see that these adults are truly happy to be at Hui Ling, that for me is the happiest moment."	1

The pilot of a tugboat towing a barge that crashed into a sightseeing "duck boat" -- killing two tourists -- intends to plead guilty to a charge stemming from the July 2010 accident, federal prosecutors said Thursday Matthew   Vokes, 37, of Los Angeles, is scheduled to be arraigned at the federal court in New York City on Monday on charges of failing to save two people from a shipwreck and failing to render aid to a person who became entangled in machinery. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said he will decide whether Vokes will plead guilty by June 30.Vokes is scheduled to be sentenced on May 17. He faces up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine, Berman said. The judge said prosecutors would consider whether to recommend a sentence of time served. The government agreed not to object to any sentence Vokes may seek in exchange for his guilty plea.The accident happened in the waters off Fire Island as Vokes and the tugboat were on their way back from a training exercise. Both Vokes and the Coast Guard testified that during the three-hour struggle that followed, the tugboat came within 20 yards of two passengers on the boat -- Christina McDonough, 48, and Thomas Kelly, 48 -- when the tug struck the barge, killing them.The passenger vessel, the Seabury, was traveling up the East River and back in to New York City when the tugboat's engine suddenly shut off and its steering controls completely locked up. The tugboat, the Fire Scout and the barge collided.The investigation into the accident, revealed earlier this year by The Associated Press, concluded the tugboat was trying to tow the barge in an effort to get it in a position that would allow it to pass under the Verrazano Bridge, but that the maneuver put the tugboat beyond the scope of rescue from the Coast Guard and New York officials' jurisdiction.Vokes, the Coast Guard said, testified under oath that he could have saved his passengers. But the federal prosecutors, who argued that Vokes' testimony is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his actions prevented two lives from being lost, said that if the jury believes Vokes, it could not accept his explanation about how the tugboat came within 20 yards of the two men.The Coast Guard said in a news release that one of the passengers was still wearing	0
A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with arson in connection with a rash of car and building fires across the Los Angeles area, authorities said. Harry Burkhart was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling and will likely face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the man was was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. Burkhart is currently being held without bail. "These were serious and potentially deadly crimes that needlessly endangered thousands of innocent lives," Villaraigosa told reporters. "These crimes will not be tolerated." Burkhart is believed to a foreign national from Germany, according to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck. Authorities hope, and believe one arsonist acted alone, but will behave as though he did not until they know for sure, Beck said. Burkhart's arrest came when a sheriff's deputy stopped a van near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood early Monday, said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Jaime Moore. The van matched the description of a vehicle believed related to some of the suspicious fires and the driver resembled a man seen in a surveillance video near the scene of one fire, he said. The video showed a man who appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s, with a ponytail, dark hair and a receding hairline. No one was killed or seriously injured in the fires, though one firefighter and one civilian sustained minor injuries, said Los Angeles City Fire Chief Brian Cummings. Both he and the mayor estimated the fires caused some $3 million in damages. Among the homes damaged was one that was once occupied by the Doors frontman Jim Morrison. Eleven of the fires took place overnight, in the very early hours of Monday: nine within the city of Los Angeles and two in West Hollywood, fire department spokesman Cecco Secci said. Cars were set on fire in Hollywood and Van Nuys, Moore said. Los Angeles has not seen such a rash of fires since the city's riots in 1992.

The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a critical report Tuesday saying that it has "serious concerns" about Iran's nuclear program and has obtained "credible" information that the Islamic republic may be developing nuclear weapons. The  agency, which monitors countries' nuclear programs, said Iran may be covertly trying to advance its weapons program.Iran has also been accused of working with Pakistan to develop nuclear technology. Tehran denies both activities, saying its nuclear program is for civilian purposes.In a lengthy document that included interviews with more than 150 experts, the IAEA said that Tehran may be trying to develop nuclear warheads, but "also appears to be pursuing the option to produce nuclear weapons.""It is our firm view that Iran is working on nuclear weapons for multiple purposes: proliferation and use, as well as the development of nuclear weapons technology," the agency said in the report."This can be seen through the multiple activities Iran's nuclear program has carried out," the report said.The report was prepared following the agency's "first-of-a-kind" inspection of Iranian nuclear sites in 2006.The latest round of inspections of Iran's nuclear sites is one of the most comprehensive in U.S. history, and is part of an international effort to halt Tehran's nuclear program.The United States, in a bid to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, has been pushing allies like Britain and France to back tough economic sanctions against Tehran. Those moves are intended to pressure Iran into abandoning its atomic program, which the U.S. has accused of having the capability to deliver nuclear weapons.Iran has been accused by the U.S. and Israel of pursuing nuclear armament, which they deny. Israel has warned that the country would be considered a "nuclear weapon state" if it were to develop atomic arms.Iran has not yet acknowledged the existence of nuclear weapons and U.S. officials have repeatedly said, Iran has not yet met any of Washington's conditions for relinquishing its nuclear program. Israel has said Iran has never acknowledged possessing such weapons."This document clearly signals Iran’s decision to continue with the nuclear pathway and this is a concern for the U.S. and its allies around the world," said one senior administration official.In the past, the U.S. has expressed concern about Iran's nuclear plans, but has not been as forthright with the	0
First trip to Malmo? Here's some insider advice to help you get the most out of your visit. Locals like to take a cold dip after a sauna at Ribersborgs Kallbadhus. Getting around town Most of Malmo's attractions are reachable by foot, but flat terrain and an abundance of cycle paths also make the city ideal to explore by bike. Rentals run around 120 kronor. You can also jump on the eco-friendly buses that criss-cross the city. Visit the tourist office at Central Station for maps. If you opt for a taxi, be sure to set the price of the trip with the driver before setting off. Ice cool  For more than a century, locals have been visiting the Ribersborgs Kallbadhus for a steam in the sauna followed by a dip in the Baltic. The swimming baths are open year-round. If you want to blend in with the locals, brave the elements and hit the baths in the winter for an icy plunge. A better time to visit for the less adventurous is in the summer, when the baths are open for sunbathing. Living green  As part of its post-industrial transformation, Malmo has become a leader in environmental design. The city's green achievements are reflected by the Bo01 housing development, a waterfront regeneration project with a focus on environmentally-friendly living. For the latest in green design, visit the Western Harbor and Augustenborg neighborhoods. For a more informed look, contact the local Environmental Department, which occasionally offers free guided tours of the city's ecologically sustainable areas. Around the Sound  Malmo is located just 35 minutes by train from the Danish capital of Copenhagen, and every day thousands travel between the two cities via the Oresund Bridge. Trains leave from Malmo every 20 minutes for most of the day. After midnight, service is less frequent.	1
The wife of Singapore's first prime minister died at her home  in New Zealand after falling ill on Monday evening (22 August). Hei Sun Lin, 83, was described by Singapore state media as "a true hero".The couple, who married in 1939, were married for 53 years before their first son was born in 1960.The former prime minister's eldest son, Mr Simon Lim, told Channel NewsAsia by phone from New Zealand that his father was in very poor health following two months of ill health, but expected to survive.He said Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was in shock at the news of his wife's death, and said he expected to return home to the island next week."He has been in contact, and I've been in contact with him," Mr Lim said.Mr Lim said his father's health started to deteriorate over a period of around five months last June, when he had to undergo a heart operation to treat a blockage in his heart.The government has announced it is providing a $1.6 billion fund to help those affected by the effects of the July 8 fire that killed more than 400 people in central Singapore.More than $500 million has already been offered by the Singapore and New Zealand governments to help the survivors.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said more than 40,000 Singaporeans were displaced by the fire.It said around 12,000 people were rescued, while around 80,000 buildings were destroyed and 70,000 families have been affected.It said more than 2,700 people have died in the blaze, including at least two children between the ages of five and eight.An Indonesian court today has found the death sentence against three people convicted in the 2002 Bali bombings to be "unduly harsh".A panel of judges at Bandung Regional Trial Court handed down an interim order on Friday that would allow for the three to be released pending a ruling on their final appeal on 5 September at Indonesia's Supreme Court.More than 270 people were killed in the bombings, which took place during a religious festival in Indonesia's most populous city, following the detonation of explosives hidden in the vehicles of tourists, in the worst terrorist attack on Indonesia in 10 years."The court was of the view that it has the right to hear the appeal," prosecutor Nurhadi Yusuf	0
A suburban New York cardiologist has been charged in connection with a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed, according to prosecutors. Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. Requests for comment from attorneys representing Moschetto and Chmela were not returned.  It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Moschetto's attorney, Randy Zelin, said Wednesday that his client "will be defending himself vigorously," the New York Post reported. "Doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people, but Dr. Moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen, callous and criminal acts," Acting Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to "blow up a building." He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. "The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute," according to the statement from the district attorney's office.	1
A Brazilian woman has confessed to shooting her husband, dismembering him and scattering the parts in a wooded area outside Sao Paulo, police said on Wednesday. Elize Ramos Kitano Matsunaga, 38, killed her husband, Marcos Kitano Matsunaga, 42, in their apartment in Sao Paulo last month, police said. Police found his body parts in plastic bags along a road in Cotia, about 30 kilometers outside the city. On Wednesday, the chief of the homicide department, Jorge Carrasco, told a press conference that Matsunaga¹s wife had confessed. Police link Vancouver body parts to Montreal dismemberment suspect "She confessed spontaneously that she was the perpetrator of the homicide and she also confessed that she acted alone," he said. "She reaffirmed that it was a crime of passion," he added. "It was a marital argument over infidelity." Carrasco said Matsunaga, a trained nurse, confessed to shooting her husband in the head and then dragging his body to the maid's bathroom, where she dismembered him. Security cameras filmed her leaving the apartment building with large suitcases, tipping off police, who had detained her as a suspect.	1

The first person ever convicted in Idaho of knowingly spreading the HIV virus is facing new charges for the same offense, authorities said Thursday. An Ada County, Idaho, grand jury on Tuesday returned an indictment charging Kerry Thomas, 45, with seven counts of knowingly transferring the HIV virus, Jean Fisher, Ada County deputy prosecutor, told CNN. In 1990, Thomas was charged with four counts of HIV transmission and two counts of statutory rape, Fisher said. As part of a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty only to the rape charges. According to Fisher, Thomas received a 12-year sentence and had to serve three years before being eligible for parole. He was later granted early release. In 1996, however, Thomas was again charged with one count of HIV transmission, and a jury convicted him, Fisher said. He received a 15-year sentence with a seven-year minimum. Now out on parole, Thomas faces possible life in prison on the new charges because prosecutors are seeking his designation as a "persistent violator." It was not immediately known whether Thomas was in custody Thursday. He was not listed online among the inmates in the Ada County Jail. Asked why Thomas would continue to spread the virus, which causes AIDS, Fisher said, "That's the $64,000 question, for a person who has been to prison twice."	1
Channing Tatum's "Magic Mike" is back in action. On July 3, 2015, Tatum's stripper with a heart of gold will be back in theaters with a new story after winning over audiences in 2012's "Magic Â¡Man!" When we say "flesh" this week, we mean a very, very detailed scene from Tatum's upcoming movie.When we last saw him, we saw Taylor Kinney and Tatum go into a room where Tatum's character was having sex with a woman. Kinney was making out with that woman while wearing a skimpy blue dress. We were left breathless!Here's how we were left breathless in Kinney's new movieA photo posted by Taylor Kinney (@taylertKinney) on Jul 5, 2015 at 2:58pm PDTFor a movie starring two actors who have previously said they did not want to get naked, Kinney and Tatum seem to be getting naked a lot in this new movie.At the beginning of the movie, both Taylor Kinney's and Channing Tatum's characters are making out on the bed. Kinney's character is wearing a white bra and thong while Tatum's character wears a tight white thong and white bra. You get the idea; it's a pretty intimate scene.In the scene right after that, Kinney and Tatum are on the bed again! Kinney is wearing a white bra that hits just below her nipples, a black thong with a lace edge, and black knee-highs. Tatum is wearing a blue dress that's also see-through, and his character has on a black bra and a blue thong that reaches down to his ankles.And during this scene both Taylor and Channing are also kissing each other which is the only other time they kiss in the movie.During the scene right after that, Kinney shows his character with his hand while Taylor's character is doing the same thing with his tongue.Just to be clear, this is what Tatum is wearing in the scene where he and Kinney kiss; the other clothing in the picture above is Kinney and Kinney's characters and their lovers.You see, Tatum is wearing the same white dress that Kinney's character is wearing.

A man "holding 2 big knifes" was captured by police after trying to break into Paris Hilton's Los Angeles, California, home Tuesday morning, Hilton said in a Twitter posting. Police responded to a 911 call that someone was breaking into Hilton's Sherman Oaks home at 6:42 a.m., Los Angeles Police spokesman Gregory Beak said. Hilton was sleeping early Tuesday when a man with two kitchen knives attempted to enter her home, her publicist said. "The security cameras and alarm system were alerted and the police immediately came to the house and arrested the intruder who was attempting to break a window when they arrived," Dawn Miller said. The police spokesman and Hilton's publicist said no one was injured. "Paris is naturally shaken by the events but is unharmed and well," Miller said. "She is very thankful to her security team and the police for their swift and diligent response." Hilton alerted fans in a message posted on her Twitter account: "So Scary, just got woken up to a guy trying to break into my house holding 2 big knifes. Cops are here arresting him." A man taken into custody near the home was "awaiting charges" Tuesday morning, Baek said. No one was injured, he said. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report	1
Bloodshed intermingled with blood oaths early Wednesday in Egypt. Opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsy clashed violently at Cairo University, killing at least 16 people and wounding 200 more late Tuesday and early Wednesday, according to the state-run EgyNews agency. Egypt's army "will sacrifice our blood," its leaders vowed Wednesday to defend the country just hours after President Mohamed Morsy refused to bow to an ultimatum they issued two days before: Find a solution to the deadly unrest sweeping the country or be pushed aside. The statement posted on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces came as the clock ticked on the military's plan to suspend Egypt's constitution, dissolve the Islamist-led parliament and sideline the president, if Morsy does not find a way to end the unrest, military sources told Arab media and Reuters. "We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist, extremist or fool," said the statement, which was titled "The Final Hours." The military has given Morsy until 4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET ) to come up with a power-sharing agreement or face a military solution, the sources said. Morsy refused to bow to the ultimatum, setting the stage for a possible showdown. In a televised speech late Tuesday, Morsy declared he was elected president in balloting that was free and representative of the will of the people. "The people of Egypt gave me the mandate for president. They chose me in a free election. The people created a constitution which requires me to stay with the constitution," he said. "I have no choice but to bear responsibility for the Egyptian constitution." The conflict pits Morsy's supporters -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- against an opposition angered by what they say is the president's failure to take steps to improve conditions more than two years after a popular revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Morsy gave no indication of stepping down, sharing power or calling early elections, saying he was calling on the military to withdraw its ultimatum and return to its rightful work. In Morsy's place, the military has said it would install an interim council, made up mainly of civilians, until a new constitution can be drafted and a new president elected, the sources said.	1
Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. "If sanctions are adopted against Iranian  exports, we will not let the oil go out,” said Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president. Iran, which has the world's fourth-largest reserves of oil, is the world's third-largest oil exporter but is currently the world's fourth-biggest oil importer. The US and other oil producers have accused Iran of violating the 2015 2015 nuclear deal by continuing to enrich uranium and developing its military potential, which in turn has prompted a series of tit-for-tat measures by President Donald Trump.Oil pricePresident Donald Trump's threat to increase sanctions on Iran in retaliation for its alleged breach of the nuclear deal has sparked fears the price of oil will rise. The move is expected to hit US consumers, which include the United States government and its energy dependent sectors, the oil industry and auto makers, which are heavily reliant on oil. Analysts said the United States is unlikely to meet Trump's demand to increase sanctions on Iran to $100 billion a year. The International Monetary Fund, which would in theory have to agree to the sanction, warned that would be a "catastrophe" for the US economy. The US president had demanded that oil prices be pumped to $100 a barrel, while his supporters had argued that it was the US Government who had been squeezing the oil prices.RiskThe threat of new sanctions on the Iranian oil industry could have wider effects. While an increase in US sanctions would have a direct impact on oil prices, it is also more likely to send oil prices into orbit. For example, a rise in the cost of international oil could push up oil prices within the US and thus cause higher gasoline prices in the US, which would affect consumers in other countries.Possible economic effectsTrump may have threatened a massive economic blow to Iran. The International Monetary Fund estimates that sanctions on Iran would cost the US economy $350 billion a year, and possibly increase economic growth. The IMF warned that a US-Iranian trade war could cause widespread disruption to oil supplies, disrupting world energy supplies on a large scale. US sanctions also have an impact on global financial markets, in which Iran is heavily dependent.The Trump administration has said it will not be accepting the Iran	0
As the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial was officially dedicated Sunday, speakers called for carrying on King's ideals and values and confronting issues including bullying and social and economic justice for all Americans.  Speakers and participants included:Former President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, Jr. Former President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, Jr. gave remarks to the dedication ceremony. Bush recounted that as a 12-year-old child at Riverside Church in New York when he and his parents were confronted in his hometown by the church's congregation after church member and civil rights activist John Lewis of Atlanta was shot and killed. He said that Lewis' father was "deeply shaken" upon hearing the news of Lewis' death and expressed that "to have him come up to my mother and say, ‘I love you and I'm sorry’ — and to leave my father standing there — was a very powerful moment." They also recalled a September 1965 protest at the Lincoln Memorial by Martin Luther King Jr. along with Dr. King's parents, Coretta and Roy, where young Martin showed his parents a copy of the Selma to Montgomery marches poster he had created and which read, "I have a dream." Bush and McCain discussed the importance of honoring King's legacy through the National Memorial and King's involvement in the Selma to Montgomery marches. They also talked about the importance of honoring "the people who have made the dream of America real over the long term," and stated that King was an activist and an inspiration to all Americans. They talked about the need for healing after the deaths of King, Coretta, and Roy and the need for continuing the legacy and the values of King's ideals by continuing to fight for democracy and justice. Bush and McCain called on all Americans to remember their history and pay tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and keep his ideals alive.Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and retired Lt. General Walter SharpFormer National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and retired Lt. General Walter Sharp gave remarks at the dedication of the National Memorial. Both men reflected on their shared faith, being raised in segregated homes, and being the only blacks in their families.

Within the last month, our country has witnessed two senseless, high-profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown-skinned Arab Muslim men with foreign-sounding names had committed them. Because two white men committed these acts of violence, however, our political and media chattering class never used the word "terrorism" in its discussions. Most recently, John Patrick Bedell, a 36-year-old man from California, walked up to two security guards outside the Pentagon Metro station in suburban Washington and started shooting. He was then shot and killed. According to The Christian Science Monitor, Bedell appeared "to have been a right-wing extremist with virulent anti-government feelings" and also battled mental illness before his shooting rampage. A few weeks ago, on February 18, another white anti-government extremist named Joseph Stack flew his small airplane into an Internal Revenue Service building in Austin, Texas,  killing two people and injuring 13 others. According to media reports, Stack had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our American government and outlined grievances with the IRS, chillingly stating that "violence not only is the answer; it is the only answer." Both the Pentagon Metro and IRS attacks come at a time of "explosive growth in [domestic] extremist-group activism across the United States," according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A recently released law center report showed so-called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the Southern Poverty Law Center report judged to be an "astonishing" rise in the one-year period since President Obama took the oath of office. The number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009, the report said. Even so, for any reasonable observer who is still skeptical about labeling the recent Pentagon area shooting and IRS attack terrorism, keep one thing in mind: Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive-skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad. Our national media and political commentators would have wasted little time in calling both of these acts terrorism, and some might have also called for the closings of other IRS and federal government office buildings around the country as a necessary counter-terrorism safety precaution.	1
Gary Owens, the veteran voice-over artist with a rich baritone and a career that spanned various entertainment industries, has died. He was 80. Owens had been a diabetic since he was 8. He died Thursday surrounded by relatives at his Los Angeles area home, his son Chris Owens said. "His body just kind of failed. We are grateful that he died so peacefully with all of us present and that he was able to remain vital throughout his life. I would like people to remember how good my father was. It would be hard to count how many times people approached my brother and I to tell us how much they loved working with my dad." The veteran radio personality had been part of the entertainment industry since his teenage years, and will be remembered for his deep baritone and nuanced comedic timing. Owens was the announcer on "Laugh-In," a sketch show starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. His list of accolades was not limited to one particular entertainment industry. He hosted syndicated radio shows in a series of markets, and appeared on TV shows such as "Mad About You," "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch," "Roseanne" and "That '70s Show." Owens was a busy man. He also wrote books and did commercial voice-overs and TV promo spots, his son said. His voice-over work included notable series such as "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Wonderful World of Disney." He also appeared in 3,000 cartoons either as a narrator or a superhero, including Space Ghost and Batman, according to his family. "He always said he was one of the luckiest men because ... he got to achieve everything he dreamed of," Chris Owens said. "He got to work with greats like Bob Hope, Neil Simon -- all the great people he admired, including Walt Disney.  Even his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is right next to Walt Disney's." In 1996, the South Dakota native was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in Washington, and the National Television Hall of Fame five years after that. Owens is survived by his wife,  Arleta Owens, and one other son, Scott Owens. People we've lost in 2015 CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report	1
She went to the University of Missouri to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a competitive swimmer. Sasha Menu Courey made the team there, on scholarship, in 2009. But the following year, something happened that changed the course of her promising college career -- something her parents didn't learn about until after she died. "People were telling us that she had been raped and she wrote it in her journal," said Lynn Courey, Courey's mother. Courey committed suicide in 2011. In light of a 16-month investigation by ESPN's "Outside the Lines" program, new questions are being raised about what the university knew about the alleged assault, and when officials knew it. The president of the university sent a letter to school officials late Sunday, saying that he is asking to hire independent counsel to conduct an investigation of the school's handing of the case. The investigation has now also been referred to the Columbia Police Department from the University of Missouri Police Department. "Our detectives will do the best they can with the investigation. It was not reported to us until now and we are almost four years behind," Sgt. Joe Bernhard, a Columbia police spokesman, told CNN. "We can make a difference for others" According to the ESPN report, in February 2010, after a night out drinking with friends, Courey said she went home with a former university football player -- off-campus -- and had consensual sex. Months later, she told a rape crisis counselor and wrote in her journal that after the former football player left, another football player entered the room, locked the door and raped her. Courey's parents say their daughter also talked about the alleged assault with a campus nurse and a campus doctor, 11 months after the attack. The school never launched an investigation. School officials say they weren't told about the suspected attack by either the nurse or the doctor because of a policy of not reporting sexual assaults without a victim's consent. Courey's parents say their daughter had a long history of depression, and in the months after the alleged rape, she grew more and more despondent. In 2011, Courey took her own life. "We lost our daughter and we cannot bring her back, but we can make a difference for others," her mother said. "The University did the right thing"	1
Russian military aircraft flew just 500 feet over two U.S. Navy ships this week as the ships participated in a joint military exercise with South Korea in the Sea of Japan, according to U.S. military officials. Two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew only 500 feet above a U.S. aircraft carrier. On Monday, two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft, known as "Mays," overflew the U.S. aircraft carrier Stennis while it was in international waters in the Sea of Japan. The Russian aircraft flew about 500 feet over the ship, lower than other flights the Russians have made over U.S. ships in the past year. The USS Stennis was about 80 miles east of Pohang, South Korea, participating in the joint military exercise when the flyover occurred. On Tuesday, the USS Blue Ridge, a lead command and control ship, and the Stennis were overflown by two Russian "Bear" long-range bombers multiple times, according to U.S. military officials. The Bears overflew the ships at about 2,000 feet, officials said. U.S. military officials said that in both cases, U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighters met up with the Russian aircraft about 70 nautical miles from the U.S. ships and flew alongside them until they left the area. On both days, U.S. aircraft tried contacting the Russian planes on international air frequency radio channels, but the Russian pilots did not respond, officials said. The last time Russian planes flew over a U.S. Navy ship was February 2008, when two Bears flew 2,000 feet over the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz south of Japan. Russian long-range flights skirting U.S. or other nations' boundaries have also been common over the last year. Although the Pentagon does not often talk about the overflights, there is nothing illegal about the actions, and they are generally seen by the United States as nothing more than muscle-flexing by the Russian military.	1
American missiles were used in an attack that killed 55 people, including 41 civilians, in southern Yemen, Amnesty International said Monday. The human rights organization released what it said were photographs of a U.S.-manufactured cruise missile used in the December attack in the community of al-Ma'jalah, and said authorities must be held accountable. "Based on the evidence provided by these photographs, the U.S. government must disclose what role it played in the al Ma'jalah attack, and all governments involved must show what steps they took to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries," said Philip Luther, deputy director of the organization's Middle East and North Africa program. Asked about the report, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said, "I would refer you to the Yemeni government for any information on operations against al Qaeda in their country. That said, the Yemen government should be commended for dealing with the al Qaeda threat in their nation. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatens the stability of the region and poses an increasing threat to Yemenis and Americans. We strongly support actions against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and cooperate closely with Yemen and other countries on counterterrorism initiatives." The government of Yemen has not yet been reached for comment. Yemeni government officials had said the December 17, 2009, attack in southern Yemen targeted an al Qaeda training camp, according to Amnesty International. The attack killed 55 people, including 14 alleged members of the terrorist group, the organization said. Civilians killed included 14 women and 21 children, Amnesty International said. Amnesty International said the photos were provided to the organization by a confidential source. It said the organization had spent months checking their contents with specialists, but teams from Amnesty International had not yet been able to visit the site to verify the images. In December, senior U.S. officials told CNN U.S. special operations forces and intelligence agencies, and their Yemeni counterparts, were working to identify potential al Qaeda targets in Yemen. This was part of a new classified agreement with the Yemeni government that the two countries will work together and that the United States will remain publicly silent on its role in providing intelligence and weapons to conduct strikes, the officials said. Officially the United States has not said it conducted previous airstrikes in Yemen, but officials have privately said the Yemeni military could not have carried out the strikes on its own.	1
What has the popular Pope Francis done now? A woman in Argentina says the pope called her Monday and told her she could receive Communion, despite being married to a divorced man, reports say.

The move was in response to the Pope Benedict, who, in 2013, said that divorced Catholics should not be allowed to receive the Eucharist in the Eucharist, and in January, the Pope Francis said he was not bound by the rules of the Holy See.http://www.catholic.org/saintpope.phphttp://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-divorced-married.htmlIt won’t help the situation in Argentina. According to the Catholic Church, the couple are “not in full communion,” and, in fact, they’re divorced. The pope can’t have them receive Communion, because they are not in full communion. And, for one thing, Pope Francis has explicitly ruled that divorced and remarried Catholics can receive Communion, and the pope has even given them the permission to teach at their parish.So, the pope would have been wrong to allow them to receive Communion. And, as many people pointed out, it really stinks when the pope claims to want to “reform” the Eucharist, and then turns around and does exactly what Pope Benedict did.http://www.christianpost.com/news/pope-francis-called-his-spokespeople-and-asked-him-to-reform-the-eucharist-71189/http://www.patheos.com/	0
On Saturday, just hours after four suicide bombers set off a series of blasts in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri that left at least fifty people dead and scores more wounded, the militant organization thought responsible for the attacks, Boko Haram, reportedly announced that it was swearing allegiance to the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). According to a report quoting the SITE extremist monitoring organization, an audio recording purportedly from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, hailed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as "caliph" and declared: "We announce our allegiance to the Caliph...and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity." This latest development is not entirely unexpected given the increasing convergence between the two groups over the course of the last year as well as the severe pressure that the militaries of Nigeria and its neighbors have recently (if somewhat belatedly) brought to bear on it. In fact, the "shout-outs" exchanged regularly between Boko Haram and ISIS were not just rhetorical flourishes, but indicative of a veritable courtship as the former appropriated more and more of the latter's symbolism, tactics, and ideology. This isn't the first time that Boko Haram has adapted itself to conform with a larger extremist network that could aid it: previously the group underwent a similar evolution after Shekau took over from its slain founder, Muhammad Yusuf, in 2009 and aligned it with al-Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which gave Boko Haram training as well as facilitated its carrying out of Nigeria's first suicide bombings in 2011. Despite the assistance that Boko Haram received from AQIM and other aligned groups in the years since, the Nigerian militants' ideology and brutal tactics have progressively drawn closer to those of ISIS. Like ISIS, Boko Haram has progressed far beyond asymmetric terrorist attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in its successfully overrunning and effectively controlling large parts in northeastern Nigeria and displacing millions of people. Just two weeks ago, in his most recent annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned the U.S. Congress that "Boko Haram will probably continue to solidify its control over its self-declared Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria and expand its terror campaign into neighboring Nigerian states, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad."	1
Novak Djokovic beat world number one Rafael Nadal to claim the Miami Masters 1000 title Sunday and maintain his winning start to 2011. Djokovic saw off Nadal 4-6 6-3 7-6 for his 24th straight victory since the start of the season, including the Australian Open title and two Masters crowns, both times at the expense of the Spaniard in close finals. After more than three hours of pulsating action, Nadal finally cracked in the third set tiebreaker at 2-2 when he served up a double fault. His Serbian opponent seized on the opening as he took five points in a row to hold four match points at 6-2. Nadal bravely saved two, but on the third a forehand winner gave Djokovic his second title at the prestigious hard court tournament. "It was very close and it really could have gone either way," he said after lifting the trophy. "It was one of the best finals I ever played in my life, and it's always a great pleasure and honor playing against Rafa, who is a good friend and a great champion." Nadal, who will now turn to his favorite surface of clay as he defends his ranking against the fast rising number two Djokovic, conceded he had been second best. "Today I had some good chances, but Novak was too good for me this afternoon," he said. A single break of service in each set saw the pair share the opening two sets, which were marked by punishing baseline rallies. The pattern continued in the third, with neither man able to break though on his opponent's service, setting the scene for the decisive tiebreaker. Both men had won their semifinal matches in straight sets, with Djokovic beating home hope Mardy Fish and Nadal dispatching former world number one Roger Federer.	1
Defending champions Egypt will play Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations final after thrashing bitter rivals Algeria 4-0 in a semifinal that saw their opponents finish with just eight men. The game was evenly poised until Rafik Halliche brought down Emad Moteab in the area eight minutes before the break. Halliche was sent off and Hosni Abd Rabou converted the spot-kick to put Egypt on their way for a possible third successive title. Mohamed Zidan added a classy second after 65 minutes before Nadir Belhadj then saw red for a horror challenge on Ahmed El Mohamady five minutes later. Mohamed Abdelshafy grabbed his first goal for Egypt nine minutes from the end, but there was still time for Algeria goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi to pick up a second yellow card -- and for Mohamed Gedo to make it 4-0 in stoppage time. The result proved sweet revenge for Egypt who missed out on a World Cup spot when they were beaten by Algeria in a play-off. There was controversy surrounding Egypt's opener. The penalty decision appeared clear-cut but Hosni converted with the help of a stuttering run-up which incensed Chaouchi, who made a vehement protest to the referee and was lucky not to be sent off himself. Zidan doubled the advantage after turning Belhadj inside out before dispatching a left-footed shot into the far corner. Belhadj's evening got worse after he launched a two-footed lunge on El Mohamady and was rightly given his marching orders. Abdelshafy came off the bench to add a third with a neat finish from an acute angle. Chaouchi was then dismissed two minutes from time as he swung his foot at Gedo, who moments later finished past substitute keeper Mohamed Zemmamouche for the fourth. Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Ghana edged past near-neighbors Nigeria 1-0 in a match which produced much less drama. Asamoah Gyan scored the only goal midway through the first half when a Kwadwo Asamoah corner caught out the napping Super Eagles defence and the Rennes striker applied the finishing touch. It was one-way traffic thereafter as wasteful finishing from Nigeria, coupled with some dogged defending and solid goalkeeping from Richard Kingston, helped the four-time former winners seal a place in the final for the first time since 1992.	1
One of Hallmark's ornaments for the holiday season is snowballing into some controversy following the replacement of the word "gay" while quoting "Deck the Halls."  Although the actual quote was "deck it all up," Hallmark chose to use "gay" in the illustration and the caption of their ornament this year.The controversy began when several LGBT organizations, on their Facebook pages, responded with their concerns and requested that Hallmark replace the word "gay" with "gayle" or "gayla" in their ornament. The organizations also called for Hallmark to replace "Gay" with "Gayle" in every other instance in every other Hallmark ornament in the history of the company. The organizations cited a Hallmark spokesperson's statement that "Deck the Halls" is not a Hallmark Christmas Ornament, but the statement was not supported by any evidence that the company had authorized any changes.After the statement was reported in The Huffington Post, Hallmark issued the following statement:"Our goal is to bring joy to as many hearts as possible, and while we don't control the words we use to describe that joy, we make every effort to use the best possible wording to convey the true meaning and spirit of the season.We believe it's important to have all faiths and people celebrate the Christmas holiday, and we're glad to join a number of companies and organizations in promoting that. However, we feel this controversy is overblown and has no place in the Hallmark holiday story. In all of our ornament decorations, we have always made it clear that "Deck the Halls" doesn't always mean "gay," "gayle," or even "gayla."Our ornament maker is a Christian, so as always, he used "Deck the Halls" in our ornament this year. We want to be sure that as we celebrate the season, we've chosen the best words to describe that joy."This has resulted in an outcry from several LGBTQ groups, who are questioning the appropriateness of using an exclusively Christian ornament company to celebrate the holiday season.Gayle S. Williams is CEO and President of the Southern Poverty Law Center and is a prominent spokesperson for LGBTQ civil rights. She said of the controversy:"The use of the word "gayle" in a Hallmark Christmas ornament is an example of the intolerance of the LGBT community for other people to be able to	0
Borderlands 2" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora. At a hands-on demo, a pre-alpha build of the new title showed off two ersatz planets inspired by science fiction movies and video games.There will be an even higher level of detail on the world of Pandora that developer Gearbox Software and Telltale Entertainment have been working to build. The company plans to release a playable demo at PAX Prime in Seattle on July 19 and to demonstrate some of its new ideas at Comic-Con.The two-year-old company first showed off its upcoming game at PAX Prime 2012. However, many of the details and features weren't fully fleshed out.After more than a year of work, Gearbox and its partners announced the final details of the game at E3 this summer. The game also made the rounds at PAX Prime, where developers were able to hold demos for audiences.The developers and publishers have a lot riding on how well the game does. With the potential for its high-quality graphics and strong story, the developers plan to make the biggest-ever effort to improve the game. They also want players to be able to jump into the game as early as possible, but with a more robust and full experience."I think the game is on par with other AAA games at the moment," Telltale CEO Pete Hawley said in a recent interview with GamesBeat. "We have to be very careful not to be an imitation of a video game, where we're making an unplayable game."Our ultimate goal is to produce a game that is as powerful as a game like Call of Duty by having as many guns, as many environments as the Call of Duty games have, and having as much variety as other video games," Hawley added.The game is based on a universe in which the player takes on the role of a soldier in Pandora. The player will have the ability to choose from a wide variety of weapons and vehicles.Other game makers have a reputation for focusing too much on the graphics on their games. The developer told GamesBeat that the team is very proud of the work they've done in developing the game."We had a lot of work, with a lot of people, to deliver the level of detail," Telltale writer and director Ben	0
The Netherlands plans to ban foreigners from the country's famed pot shops, a decision Amsterdam's tourism industry hopes goes up in smoke. The Dutch Cabinet late last month said the measure was needed to "reduce nuisance and drugs tourism," arguing that "substance use of minors has to be countered more strongly and that coffee shops have grown into large points of sale of cannabis that are hard to manage." Known as the "Weed Pass," the measure will turn coffee shops into private clubs for Dutch citizens over the age of 18. The memberships will last for a minimum of a year, and each shop will have a capped number of members. "Persons who do not hold Dutch citizenship will not have access to the coffee shops," the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice said in a statement. "The Cabinet expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the Netherlands to purchase and consume cannabis. After all, many of them can use the illegal markets available in their immediate surroundings," it says. The government said the measure also is needed to crack down on drug trafficking near the borders with Germany and Belgium. "The number of criminal organizations that will be dealt with will be doubled from 20 to 40%," the Ministry of Security and Justice said in its statement. But even in announcing the tougher stand, the government said Dutch drug use has "remained more or less stable in the past decade." Under the current plan, the measure will go into effect this year in the southern part of the country, and then for the rest of the country in 2012. The city of Amsterdam, including its mayor, has vowed to fight the measure. "The Dutch government has decided upon this for the whole of the Netherlands. Amsterdam doesn't want it," said Machteld Ligtvoet, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board. Ligtvoet added, "Coffee shops are not actively promoted by our organization and are not used in order to attract tourists. However, the mere idea that one can buy and use soft drugs here is an attractive aspect of Amsterdam and its famous spirit of freedom." The Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board says the new measure should be dismissed because it discriminates against foreigners. The board also says it fears "soft drugs will be sold on the street again, leading to more crime and dangerous situations."	1
The Ebola outbreak "continues to accelerate" in West Africa and has killed 1,552 people, the World Health Organization said Thursday. The total number of cases stands at 3,069, with 40% occurring in the past three weeks. "However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities," the WHO said. The outbreak, the deadliest ever, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. The overall fatality rate is 52%, the WHO said, ranging from 42% in Sierra Leone to 66% in Guinea. The WHO issued a "road map" Thursday that "responds to the urgent need to dramatically scale up the international response" in light of the acceleration of new cases, it said. It aims to stop Ebola transmission in affected countries within six to nine months and prevent its spread internationally. The road map prioritizes the setting up of treatment centers, community mobilization and safe burials. It will also try to overcome bottlenecks in vital supplies such as personal protective equipment, disinfectants and body bags. The road map is based on an assumption that "in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be 2-4 fold higher than that currently reported," the document states. It also acknowledges that the total number of cases "could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency." But such a plan is easier stated than carried out, said the aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres. The road map should not give a false sense of hope, the group's director of operations, Brice de le Vingne, said in a statement. "A plan needs to be acted upon," he said. "Huge questions remain about who will implement the elements in the plan." All of the best medical aid organizations have not had the proper setup to respond at the scale needed to seriously make a dent in the Ebola outbreak, he said. "As an international public health emergency, states with the capacity to help have the responsibility to mobilize resources to the affected countries, rather than watching from the sidelines with a naive hope that the situation will improve," he said. Vaccine trials accelerated An Ebola vaccine being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline will be fast-tracked for human trials, the international consortium behind the effort said Thursday.	1
More than two dozen college players on three major Division I football teams staged an unauthorized protest of the NCAA during their games Saturday. With black marker, they wrote the letters "APU" standing for "All Players United" on their gear as part of a pledge calling for NCAA reform. The pledge, designed by the nonprofit group the National College Players Association (NCPA), calls for the NCAA to take more steps to minimize brain trauma, and for money to be designated to increase scholarships and graduation rates, and guarantee medical treatment. It also includes support for those involved in Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the NCAA. O'Bannon, a former UCLA basketball star, is suing for the rights to his own likeness in video games and TV broadcasts. "The priorities are misplaced and part of this movement is to address that," said Ramogi Huma, president of the NCPA. Twenty-eight athletes playing for Northwestern, University of Georgia and Georgia Tech were seen participating. "I think it was a smart decision by the players to design a campaign as visible as the logos that they wear," Huma said. Mixed reaction on protest After the games, the NCAA said in a statement that it "supports open and civil debate regarding all aspects of college athletics." But there was less room for discourse after the Georgia Tech game, where head coach Paul Johnson said, "I assure you that now that I am aware of it we'll talk to them about it." Two players who participated at two different universities told CNN they wanted to talk about it, but backed out of interviews after their respective games. CNN caught up with two other players who wore APU on their gear after the Georgia Tech game. Georgia Tech quarterback Vad Lee backed away from his actions, saying he wrote it as a favor to injured teammate Isaiah Johnson. Defensive end Jeremiah Attaochu told CNN that he, too, made a last-minute decision to wear APU, but that he does believe in the cause. "I know the guys out there go to Georgia Tech and don't have the academics to fall back and things like that so, you know, looking out for everybody," Attaochu said. A team handler who was standing nearby discouraged CNN from asking questions about the pledge, and cut questions short. Huma, the NCPA president, later told CNN that he hadn't heard of any players being disciplined for wearing the gear. Controversies plague NCAA	1
A superboat custom built for the most recent James Bond blockbuster was the star act at the Scotland Boat Show, a three-day show at the weekend. The "Quantum of Solace," a 43-foot Sunseeker Superhawk, is one of Â£500,000 boats and has been designed by a team of naval architects from the Royal United Services Institution (RUSI) in London and from the US. It was presented at the show at the West Coast Boat Show in Orkney, an island off the coast of Scotland, as a final demonstration of the boat's capabilities, which are to be revealed in the film of the same name.The boat, a three part design, was built in a private firm in Orkney, is a British built Sunseeker, which is a boat with an aluminium hull and can sail to a speed of 25 knots, and a maximum of 33 knots. The movie was shot on a small scale with the boat's crew, and the first shot of the movie was taken from the boat, which looked like an underwater submarine. The boat contains a submarine-like compartment, as did other supercars owned by James Bond. The movie's plot was written by the British writer Ian Fleming and the movie producer Albert R. Broccoli, and was directed by Daniel Craig. The first Bond film in which a swim-through tunnel was used was 1962's "Dr. No," followed by "The Man with the Golden Gun" in 1964, "Goldfinger" in 1965 and 1973's "For Your Eyes Only," and "The Spy Who Loved Me" in 1975. The most popular theme tune was the James Bond theme, by composer John Barry, and the most popular James Bond soundtrack album, by Nicholas Meyer. James Bond has been in film series since the 1950s.The "Quantum of Solace" has been seen, filmed, and filmed again, several times, by the team of researchers at the Royal United Services Institution; they even showed the boat in London a few months ago.The RUSI team and the superboatIn August, the RUSI team started by testing the boat at the Royal Yacht Club in Portsmouth, UK; they also tested the superboat in Orkney. The boat was towed, and the engine was craned from a nearby dock. The boat will then be transported to the Scottish Boat Show, where it will be	0
It was my first chance to spend some quality time at dinner with First Lady Michelle Obama, so I decided to do what my pal Ali Velshi would probably do in the same situation: get her hooked on Twitter. I was sitting with the first lady and Jay Leno at the head table for Saturday night's White House Correspondents Association Dinner because I'm a member of the association's board, a front-row seat to the slew of celebrities who walked up to gawk at Mrs. Obama and the president, who was a few seats from me. Teen sensation Justin Beiber, famous-for-being-famous Kim Kardashian, comedian Chevy Chase and actor Morgan Freeman all walked up to the rope line separating the head table from the rest of the ballroom to send the first couple a shout-out. I was snapping pics of the celebrity parade on my iPhone and posting them to my Twitter account, @edhenrycnn, during dessert, just a few minutes before the president and Leno would take their turns at telling some jokes. Leno, a social media skeptic, finally turned to me with squinted eyes and said in a conspiratorial tone, "Are you tweeting right now?" I confessed to Leno that I was, sparking Mrs. Obama to ask me whether journalists find value in social media or whether it's mostly trivial. I said I find it helpful to get feedback, good and bad, from people who follow my tweets. When Mrs. Obama mentioned that she had never tweeted, I noted that the president had sent out his first tweet a few months ago from a Red Cross account to promote relief to Haiti and wondered aloud: "Why don't you send out your first tweet on my iPhone?" The first lady laughed and said her press staff wouldn't be happy if she went rogue like that. Besides, she said, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs would have to sign off first. Noting that Gibbs was sitting at the other end of the head table, I stood and told the first lady I'd ask him. To my surprise, Gibbs instantly told me it was a fun idea, on one condition: I had to first send out a tweet saying he had endorsed it, so that colleagues on Mrs. Obama's staff were not blindsided. I typed out a tweet saying, "i am trying to coax First Lady to do her first ever tweet. Gibbs @presssec just gave his blessing."	1
One would expect that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the best interests of the public in mind, but its recent decisions have cast serious doubt upon this assumption. One in particular could have a dramatic impact on the safety of the U.S. food supply: It is the mandate of the EPA to regulate the use of agricultural chemicals like insecticides and herbicides, as well as to determine their allowable limits in food and drinking water. Herbicides (weed killers) are mixtures of chemicals designed to spray on weeds, where they get inside the plants and inhibit enzymes required for the plant to live. The active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide is glyphosate, while some herbicides contain 2,4D.  2,4D is best known as a component of Agent Orange, a defoliant widely employed during the Vietnam War. Until the introduction of GM crops about 20 years ago, herbicides were sprayed on fields before planting, and then only sparingly used around crops. The food that we ate from the plants was free of these chemicals. In stark contrast, with herbicide resistant GM plants, the herbicides and a mixture of other chemicals (surfactants) required to get the active ingredient into the plant are sprayed directly on the crops and are then taken up into the plant. The surrounding weeds are killed while the GM plant is engineered to resist the herbicide. Therefore, the food crop itself contains the herbicide as well as a mixture of surfactants. To accommodate the fact that weeds are becoming glyphosate resistant, thereby requiring more herbicide use, the EPA has steadily increased its allowable concentration limit in food, and has essentially ignored our exposure to the other chemicals that are in its commercial formulation. As a result, the amount of glyphosate-based herbicide introduced into our foods has increased enormously since the introduction of GM crops.  Multiple studies have shown that glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic and likely public health hazards. Of equal importance in terms of health is the fact that herbicides are now being used to rapidly kill non-GM grain crops at the end of their growing season in order to speed up harvesting.  So, a product can be labeled GM-free but still contain high levels of herbicide. The fact that agricultural chemicals are now inside the food crops that we eat is a fundamental shift in both our food production system and human exposure to toxic chemicals.  Unfortunately, it is about to get even worse.	1
While the eyes of golfing world were on rising star Rory McIlroy on Thursday, two surprise names claimed the first-round lead at the British Open. A tearful Thomas Bjorn overcame the recent death of his father to Â—Â he said it was a joke—a Â—Â golfing miracle at Royal St. George's course in the early afternoon, with a three-stroke victory over Jordan Spieth.Bjorn, the son of Bjorn Brynolfsson, has been playing golf since he was just 12 years old. He came out of his father's shadow, in a world where golfers from far beyond his experience are recognized and acclaimed as great golfers. Bjorn won the 2012 U.S. Amateur in his first year of competition, making him the youngest player to win a U.S. amateur title. He played well in the 2013 British Amateur, a shot behind Spieth, who had won the British Amateur the year before. Spieth ended the season with a victory at the Travelers Championship, while Bjorn had to settle for a runners-up finish. That's the kind of golf Bjorn loves, but it's a bit of a stretch to claim that he's the first great amateur golfer. So we took a look at three of the greatest amateur champions — Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Sam Snead — and their first-round finishes at golf's most prestigious tournament.Tiger WoodsTiger Woods was the greatest amateur golfer in history, and arguably the best golfer who ever lived. (Tiger Woods photo courtesy of the Sports Illustrated Archives) MoreIn the inaugural list of the greatest amateur golfers, Woods is the only one who never competed on a professional tour. He won the U.S. Amateur Championship in 1969 at age 19 and the British Amateur Championship at age 21. All of his wins were on courses that are now considered world-class, and he held his own in the professional ranks. But that's about it. The only time Tiger competed professionally was when he qualified for the Masters in 1987 and 1990, both times making the cut. After making back-to-back appearances in the Masters, it was thought by many that Woods had retired.He did retire in 1994, at age 39. No wonder, because he had one of the most dominant careers in golf history. Woods won 72 tournaments on both the P	0
Two days ago, I learned about two young people killed by drug gangs in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, their corpses bound and hung from a bridge. Unfortunately, drug murders happen so often in Mexico that they are not news anymore. This time was different. The murders have received a lot of international attention because the bodies were found with handwritten messages claiming that the couple had been killed for snitching on the cartels via the Internet. Is it possible that these murders grabbed more attention than last month's 50-person massacre because of the connection to social media? As a technologist, I find it easy to get swept up in the techno-utopian view of how social technologies are changing the world for the better. I do believe it. For example, Twitter hashtags are saving lives in Mexico by empowering citizens to report shootings and helping others to avoid them. However, those same hashtags have landed three people in jail on charges of "terrorism" for supposedly spreading false rumors online. Now we learn about the murders of supposed "Internet snitchers." It is not clear whether the couple was killed for actually posting something online or whether their murder was used as an opportunity to scare people away from social media. In any case, the messages against online reporting might indicate that social media sites are seen as a threat. For example, one of the notes on the bodies named blogdelnarco.com, a website run anonymously on Google's Blogger platform. Social technologies, like other peer-to-peer technologies, are incredibly disruptive. Social media open new opportunities for empowering the disenfranchised, but they also create big new challenges -- some so big that people's lives might hang in the balance. There has been a heated discussion in the tech world about online anonymity, especially the "real names only" policies of some social networks. Social media is seen as neutral ground by people in Mexico. They might not trust their government or even their neighbors, but they do trust big-name, high-tech companies to provide an unbiased platform that empowers them to connect with others. These events in Mexico are another reminder of the responsibility that high-tech companies have when providing these empowering platforms. Yes, these are for-profit enterprises, but with great tech power comes great responsibility (as Stan Lee might say).	1
Actress Angelina Jolie is missing the premiere of her own film Unbroken because she says she has been diagnosed with chickenpox. She made the announcement in a video in which pink spots were visible on her face,  "We are being told that we are being held hostage," says Jolie. "I'm being treated as though I'm going to fall over and die, but we're being told otherwise. We're being told that we'll be released in the first few days of next week. We're being told that we'll be returned to our jailers, where we were put under observation. We are being treated like the enemy."The actress went on to say that the people handling the "chickenpox virus" are the same people who would have sent her to the concentration camps if she became a "political prisoner" and that, “For our governments to see this movie, to see this movie and to know we're going to be in this movie is just incredible. We are being told we're going to be released from prison right before the premiere. We're being told that we have been treated as a human-rights violator.” The film is scheduled to premiere in 3D on July 29th.Jolie, who has previously said her family had been imprisoned in North Korea, is referring to her time spent on the set of director Ang Lee's 2007 film Life of Pi. Jolie's mother Kim Jin-Sook told CNN last month that the director had visited her daughter at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May and described the North Korean government as "very bad people" that she didn't think would return a daughter to her parents. The film's director was also quoted in a 2010 documentary saying that, "What the United States does to North Korean and Chinese human rights activists and activists and labor leaders is unacceptable."Jolie was seen leaving her home in Santa Monica, California, dressed in a black and white striped jumpsuit. Her publicist, Susan Korynta, told reporters that her sister and mother were both with her. "We're all together still at home," she said. There was no report on the status of the Hollywood star's husband Jon Stewart and their teenage daughter, Shiloh, whose birth was announced via Twitter on Friday.Jolie in UnbrokenHere is my recent interview with Jolie about her movie Unbroken.

Residents along the Gulf Coast continue to get pounded by heavy winds and unrelenting rain from Tropical Depression Isaac, an eerie reminder of Hurricane Katrina, which pummeled the Gulf Coast seven years ago. Hurricane safety when the lights go out Relief organizations are on the ground, providing food and shelter for those displaced from their homes. "We're still very much in the middle of a major storm," said Daphne Hart, a Red Cross spokeswoman. "The flooding is a huge concern." The Red Cross has deployed 2,400 disaster workers from Florida to Texas. On Wednesday night, more than 4,700 people spent the night in one of 80 shelters open across seven states. "We have nearly 200 emergency response vehicles that have been prepositioned in safe areas along the Gulf Coast," Hart said. "And as soon as it's safe to do so, those vehicles as well as disaster assessment teams will be canvassing the area, trying to determine what the needs are. "It could be anything from serving people hot meals as they're in their home trying to clean up, distributing clean-up kits with items such as rakes, shovels, gloves and trash bags, and just trying to get people back on their feet." To assist the Red Cross in its efforts, you can donate by visiting the website, calling 1-800-RED CROSS or texting "REDCROSS" to 90999 to make a $10 donation. If you or a loved one are in one of the affected areas, you can also let people know you are safe by registering on the Red Cross' Safe and Well page. The Salvation Army is building up emergency response teams and supplies in affected areas along the Gulf Coast. It has 24 mobile feeding units and a 54-foot field kitchen that can provide up to 31,000 meals. The organization has already provided 3,000 meals, 20,000 drinks and counseling to those in need. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist Along with providing food and water for storm victims, the Salvation Army will be on hand to assist in long-term recovery.

The United Nations has launched humanitarian plans worth $1.5 billion to help ease the suffering of millions of Syrians both inside and outside the country. More than 525,000 Syrians have already crossed into neighboring countries, the  UN refugee agency said on Monday.The vast majority of the people arriving are from the first wave of people who started to flee to Damascus from neighboring countries in mid-September, with the United Nations saying nearly 5 million people are now internally displaced. A second wave is expected to begin to arrive from Saturday.Almost all the displaced are in conflict zones: in Syria, around 60 percent of the victims are in Aleppo (an official count by the United Nations last week put the number at 60,000) while 20,000 are in Homs and 12,000 in Daraa.“This phase of the crisis is unprecedented,” said Antonio Guterres, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, explaining how the aid was needed now to help the millions who had already been internally displaced.Most of Syria's 2.5 million refugees are in the north-east and the south-east of the country. But in the west, where three-quarters of Syria's population is located, they are also displaced because of fighting between rebels and government forces.The Syrian authorities in September set up a camp in the southern suburbs of Damascus which was then joined by several hundred people from other places. Several hundred more were moved in November."We have no resources to help families that are forced to leave. We have no money to build new schools," Guterres said."This crisis will only end when Syria is able to secure a political resolution, with a credible government that is accountable to the people," he said.People were also moving to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere, with UN agencies assisting those trying to enter the refugee camps, where they are often treated harshly and denied basic rights.UN agencies are now working to provide aid to displaced people inside Syria, helping to make sure those displaced people who have been able to move to safer surroundings are not forced abroad with their families.“We are doing what we can, but there is so much more we need to do,” Guterres said.The UN has warned that more than half of the 7 million who have been displaced since war broke out in 2011, have been displaced inside Syria for up to five years.	0
The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to satisfy President Barack Obama’s pledge to expand coverage to all Americans under his law.The White House says the number of uninsured Americans has been declining as employers offer more options for benefits, the federal government steps up its outreach efforts and Congress steps up its efforts to extend coverage to children whose parents were uninsured up until last year.But the administration’s figures are only rough estimates, and because the administration and Congress have yet to release numbers on enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act’s employer insurance programs, they are less reliable.The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to pass a $63 billion transportation bill with a provision to provide more federal money to roads and bridges. The Senate has yet to take up the bill.The bill includes an additional $6.2 billion for state and local transportation programs, bringing total federal funding for transportation to more than $100 billion a year. There was no immediate comment from the administration on the proposed legislation.The Senate is expected to take up the legislation next week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed last week to put an end to the years-long debate over the federal role in the nation’s major highways, bridges and tunnels and bring a much-needed transportation funding bill before the Senate without any major funding changes.The House did the same when it passed the transportation bill. President George W. Bush signed the Highway Trust Fund into law in 1990. The fund is a mechanism for states to borrow money to pay for highways, and the federal government contributes a fixed percentage of the fund’s funding.The fund has been on a steady decline as more states took the responsibility for paying for transportation projects outside of the federal government. Congress made it permanent in 2005 with the Highway Construction and Accountability Act.The House also defeated a plan from House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica (R-Fla.) (R-Fla.) to change the highway fund into a block grant to states.The House rejected the change on a vote of 234-185, after having approved the plan in March on a voice vote, and sending the legislation to the Senate.The White House	0
Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as "an intellectual 'Rocky' " -- in the words of "Frost/Nixon" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree that the sessions had their "adversarial" moments. David Frost's interviews of Richard Nixon were some of the most watched programs of their time. Particularly, he told CNN, when the topic turned to the Watergate scandal. "By halfway through the second day [of the interviews], we had got to the point that we had hoped to get to," he said. "And then it was a point of going further and trying to get more than we had really expected." Nixon famously let down his guard, a moment depicted in in "Frost/Nixon," the new Ron Howard-directed film starring Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost. "I'm saying when the president does it, that means it's not illegal," Nixon said during the interview, cementing his ignominy. In some ways, the interviews were an odd topic for an award-winning play (and, now, well-reviewed and Golden Globe-nominated movie). Frost and Nixon mostly sat together talking. There were no punches thrown, no fiery explosions, just conversation -- if occasionally contentious conversation. The sessions in raw form ran more than 28 hours, which was edited down to four 90-minute broadcasts. But in another sense, what happened had as much suspense as a heavyweight title bout, and "Frost/Nixon" sets up the interviews by showing two men on undesired paths. Frost, the interviewer, was hoping to rejuvenate a career in decline; Nixon, the ex-president, was hoping to repair his shattered image in the aftermath of Watergate.  Watch Frost talk about the interviews » Neither figure could have predicted the face-off. Frost was a golden boy in the 1960s, the host of BBC series such as "That Was the Week That Was" and "The Frost Report," satirical shows that gave such figures as John Cleese their start. Nixon had mounted an incredible political comeback from his 1960 presidential loss and 1962 California gubernatorial loss to be elected president in 1968 -- and re-elected in a tremendous landslide in 1972.	1
Will you be any worse off the moment humans cease to speak in Aragonese? How about Navajo, or Ojibwa? Or Koro, a language only just discovered in a tiny corner of northeast India? No, you probably wouldn't, not in that moment. But humanity would be. Science, art and culture would be. If, as the phrase goes, another language equals another soul, then some 3,054 souls -- 50% of the world's total languages -- are set to die out by 2100. Mashable.com: Kindle Espanol: Amazon launches Spanish-language ebook store If there is hope, it lies in the world's centers of information -- such as Google. The search giant's philanthropic arm, Google.org, has launched the Endangered Language project, a website devoted to preserving those ancient tongues that are now only spoken by a few thousand of us. Mashable.com: How technology is speeding up humanitarian response The site, launched early Thursday, features videos and an interactive map. The curious can click on any one of the dots that hang over each country (including a suprising number in the U.S.), each representing a whole language. You can hear the heartbreaking, beautiful sound of Koro being sung, or read 18th-century manuscripts written in a nearly-dead Native American tongue. "Documenting the 3,000+ languages that are on the verge of extinction is an important step in preserving cultural diversity," write project managers Clara Rivera Rodriguez and Jason Rissman. Mashable.com: 5 startups infusing social good with innovation The idea is to unite a lot of smaller preservation efforts under the Google.org banner.

What we know -- and psychiatrists have diagnosed for decades -- as schizophrenia may really be eight separate diseases, research published in The American Journal of Psychiatry suggests. Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed the ills of the human mind using a technique called "composite endophenotyping" - "a technique of 'computational medicine'" that combats the pitfalls of single-disease thinking.What they found was that while schizophrenia may be caused by a multitude of individual conditions, each individual has an "endophenotype" -- a single trait that appears as the defining characteristic of schizophrenia in every person who suffers from it."We found that a majority of the genetic contributions to schizophrenia are endophenotypes," says lead researcher Elizabeth Siegel, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. "Our understanding of schizophrenia is evolving, and we now know that we are not just talking about one disease.""Composite endophenotyping" is a method of psychiatric diagnosis that analyzes a person's symptoms and responses to them to uncover key traits that may underlie a patient's disorder.But how and why do people experience symptoms? And what determines whether a person's symptoms are a defining characteristic of a particular disorder? These are questions psychiatrists face, and they're difficult to ask because they require looking at a person's entire body of symptoms, not just the symptoms themselves.Composite endophenotypingAnatomically, the human brain is divided into a left and right hemisphere.A person's symptoms - like hearing voices, getting lost, hearing things that aren't there, or seeing things that aren't there - are experienced in the left hemisphere, not in the right. Research has shown that in individuals with this type of brain division, the left and right parts of the brain are often in separate circuits, and each is dominant. When the left hemisphere is dominant, hallucinations or delusions are experienced. When the right hemisphere is dominant, the person's mind is often more logical, more focused, and more coherent."The right part of the brain is what we call the 'logic' and left is what we call 'emotion,' " explains Siegel, who was part of a group of psychiatrists who created a composite endophenotype of schizophrenia.Siegel and her colleagues have been developing this method of diagnosis for some years, and	0
Football is part of the lifeblood of the people of Brazil, who have seen their heroes lift the FIFA World Cup a record five times since 1958. From the legendary Pele, who inspired that initial success in Sweden and also iced the final against England, to the more recent players like Neymar, Neymar Jr or even the future of Pele’s son, up and coming Cristiano Ronaldo, football has always had a place at the top of Brazilian’s hearts. But with so many more people taking up the sport, how is the country’s beloved game going to grow and develop in a world that demands more? For those of you lucky enough to live in a country that enjoys a world-class game, this is your opportunity to help shape the future of the game in your part of the world by reading on!What is football all about?Football is a game played with a ball that moves and bounces through the air and on the ground, with a goalpost and two goal-posts, the distance between the two of which is called the “ball’s diameter”. A team of eleven players (one goalkeeper and ten outfield players who line up in the five “strips”, a line of defense) compete to score the most goals in a specific number of games (usually 30 for a match). A match is played to a point called the “final”, at which point the two teams with the fewest goals will play against each other in a “shoot-out”, which consists of two sudden-death rounds with no extra time or penalties. In this case, the team scoring more goals in the two short rounds are the winners, even if they lose the final game to the other party. Finally, football is an individual sport, as each player is responsible for only his or her own team. Even the referee is not allowed to interfere unless the game’s official results warrant it, for instance, the referee might decide to send a player off for kicking a ball that is out of play.What does “soccer” mean?Football is sometimes referred to as “soccer” because it is often referred to as a “game of skill” or a “football”. In Brazil, however, soccer is commonly referred to as “brazilian football” because most of	0
The bodies of 152 people killed in a fiery plane crash in Iran Wednesday have been returned to their families, an Iranian state broadcaster reported Sunday. An Iranian Armenian woman places flower at crash site. Ahmad Majidi, the head of the special working group investigating the Caspian Airlines crash, also said a Russian team had arrived in Iran to help study the crash of the Russian-made plane, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting said. The plane went down in a field near the city of Qavzin Wednesday, killing all 168 people on board and leaving a huge smoldering crater. Majidi did not say what had happened to the 16 bodies that have not been handed over. The plane's flight data recorders have been recovered and are being studied by Iranian and Russian experts, IRIB said. Fragments of the plane are also being examined to help determine the cause of the crash, Majidi said. The plane "disintegrated into pieces," said Col. Masood Jafari Nasab, security commander of Qazvin.  See a map of the crash location » Video of the crash site showed a huge crater in the earth scattered with charred pieces of the plane and tattered passports.  Watch as the flight data recorders are recovered » "The aircraft all of a sudden fell out of the sky and exploded on impact, where you see the crater," a witness told Iran's government-backed Press TV from the crash site. Ten members of the country's youth judo team were aboard the plane, several sources including Press TV reported. The government-backed network said the dead included eight athletes and two coaches. It was at least the fifth major airline accident in the world this year, following crashes of planes flown by Colgan Air, Turkish Airlines, Air France and Yemenia Airways. A US Airways pilot managed to land his plane safely on the Hudson river in New York City in January, with no major injuries, after the plane lost power. But aviation safety expert John Wiley said there was no reason to fear air travel in general, and no one airline or aircraft is particularly dangerous. Caspian Airlines Flight 7908 -- a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M plane -- went down near the village of Jannatabad near Qazvin at 11:33 a.m. (2:03 a.m. ET) Wednesday, Press TV reported.	1

Sunday's graduation ceremony at Hofstra University was a bittersweet affair marked by a moment of silence for a 21-year-old student killed by a police officer two days ago. Many students at the university in East Garden City, New York, wore white ribbons on their gowns in tribute to Andrea Rebello, CNN affliate WCBS reported. "I want to express our community's collective grief and our sorrow over the senseless and tragic death of a very young member of the Hofstra family," university President Stuart Rabinowitz said. "Our hearts and our thoughts and our prayers are with Andrea's family, and with her friends and classmates, many of whom are in this room this afternoon." She was killed by police gunfire during a confrontation between a home invasion suspect and authorities Friday night, a police spokeswoman said Saturday. An officer fired eight shots at the intruder, who authorities say was holding a gun to Rebello's head during a home invasion robbery at an off-campus house in Uniondale. One shot hit Rebello in the head, Maureen Roach, a spokeswoman with the Nassau County police, said. The intruder, whom authorities identified as Dalton Smith, 30, of Hempstead, was struck seven times and died. Smith invaded the home Rebello shared with her twin sister and two others during the predawn hours on Friday. At some point, a female roommate of the twins was able to leave the home and call police, a police spokesman told CNN on Friday. When a police officer arrived, Smith told the officer he was going to kill Rebello. He turned the handgun toward the officer, she said. The officer, fearing for his life, drew his gun and fired, Roach said. Authorities have not identified the officer. At the time of the shooting, Smith was wanted for jumping parole, police said. He was on parole for first-degree robbery and had an "extensive" arrest history that includes robbery, assault, and promoting prison contraband, said police in Nassau County. A warrant for his arrest was issued April 25 for allegedly absconding from parole, police said Rebello's high school principal, Carol Conklin-Spillane, said the twins' home community in Westchester was heartbroken. She described Rebello as a fun-loving, personable and self-aware young woman.	1
Brimfield Township Police Chief David Oliver keeps a picture of John Wayne in his office, but admits it's hard to know what the Duke would say about a self-described old-school cop using Facebook to sound off about enforcing the law in a small Ohio town. "I'd like to think he'd appreciate that we're communicating effectively with people," Oliver said. "But have a low tolerance for nonsense." The police chief has earned national headlines for poking fun at so-called mopes, or suspected criminals, on his department's Facebook page. Oliver's candid comments have made it the third most viewed police department page in the United States, according to Nancy Kolb, senior program manager for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. With more than 64,000 likes, it trails only the New York City Police Department and the Boston Police Department. "Up and at 'em. It's 65 degrees outside of the Center for Mope Studies," Oliver wrote in a typical post this week. The chair of Brimfield's board of trustees says Oliver's teasing of criminals is in good fun, while criminal justice experts say it falls in a gray area between traditional practices and the unethical. Oliver launched the Facebook page in 2010, after viewing a couple police department pages and deciding one would fit into his management philosophy, which is to try to run the department like a business and serve the community from within. He and his staff of 16 full-time officers say they want social media to work for those they serve. "If our customers are on Facebook and Twitter, we have to be there engaging them," said Oliver, who spoke by phone from Brimfield. "The more we communicate, the more we inform, the less people are suspicious of us." 'It takes away the moral high ground' Brimfield Township is a suburb of Kent, Ohio, with a population of more than 10,000 that is growing rapidly again after being hit hard by years of economic downturn, said Mike Kostensky, the chairman of its board of trustees. He has known Oliver for 12 years. "Dave has such a way with words," Kostensky said. "He makes people comfortable. His office is open to anybody. I guess it's a little bit of how small town America used to be." But not everyone sees productive humor in Oliver's Facebook discussions.	1
President Bush vetoed an expansion of the federally funded, state-run health insurance program for poor children for a second time Wednesday, telling Congress the bill "moves our country's health care system in the wrong direction." In his veto message, Bushsaid the bill's cuts to Medicaid would be "devastating" for the millions of low-income children and families already receiving health coverage.President Bush was on his way to a meeting with reporters in the White House East Room when he was asked about criticism from both sides of the aisle that he was failing to keep his campaign promise to fight federal Medicaid cuts that would cause huge changes to thousands of elderly and poor people.On Wednesday, as Bush was leaving the White House, the Bush administration said those cuts included $800 million in cuts that are required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."In just over one week, I've already cut one-quarter of a trillion dollars out of Medicare and Medicaid, raising prescription drug premiums by $2 billion, repealing $4 billion in tax breaks, and forcing seniors to pay more for their prescription drugs," Bush said in his veto message to Congress. "This is not an acceptable use of my time."The administration said the Congressional Budget Office found that the House legislation for Medicaid would prevent 10 million people from receiving health care over the next 10 years.The White House says the savings would come from the $800 million in cuts, rather than by increasing Medicaid rates or funding. The administration says the bill would cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, rather than raising the age-adjusted national poverty level. However, the bill actually cuts Medicaid funding as much as $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years.House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers would reject the administration's proposed cuts."We will put forward an alternative that includes much more revenue and continues to protect important health care programs that provide health care to over a million children, while lowering costs for seniors," Hoyer said.The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would raise premiums by $2 billion and reduce coverage for a million people. Under the House bill, the number of people who receive health insurance would drop from 50.3 million in 2009 to 44.4 million in 2020, according to CBO.Bush said Wednesday the proposed cuts would reduce	0
The discovery of a slain Palestinian teen in Jerusalem early Wednesday further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three Israeli teens, not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides. Mohammad Abu Khedair, 17, was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khedair, told CNN. His body was found about an hour later at a forest in Jerusalem. The killing quickly triggered condemnations from Palestinian and Israeli leaders, as well as from the United States. Abducted Palestinian teen was kind, beloved Those who spoke out passionately included an uncle of one of the three Israeli teens whose bodies were found earlier this week. He called the young Palestinian's killing "a forbidden action, and it has no forgiveness." "Any act of revenge of any kind whatsoever is completely inappropriate and wrong. Murder is murder," said Yishai Frankel, uncle of Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual Israeli-American citizen, to Israel's Channel 2. "One should not differentiate between bloods, be it Arab or Jew. Israeli authorities are probing Wednesday's death, with police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a "criminal or nationalistic" act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the Israeli  teens' killings. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN late Wednesday that investigators "at this stage cannot say who did this killing." This came hours after Netanyahu's office promised a speedy investigation to find "who is behind this despicable murder and the background to this act," according to a statement from his office. "Netanyahu calls on all sides not to take the law into their own hands. Israel is a country of law and everyone is ordered to act according to the law." The killing riled many Palestinians, particularly in Jerusalem. But it didn't happen in isolation. Israelis and Palestinians continue to trade blows -- over longstanding issues unrelated to Abu Khedair's death -- through rocket attacks and airstrikes. All this violence, from various angles, leads to one big question: When will it stop? Report: Body was 'charred and bore signs of violence'	1
Defending champions Spain are through to the 2012 Davis Cup final after a 3-1 defeat of the United States. Spanish world No. 5 David Ferrer beat John Isner 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4 6-2 in Sunday's decisive singles match in Gijon, after brothers Bob and Mike Bryan had kept U.S. hopes alive with victory in Saturday's doubles match. Spain will appear in the final for the sixth time in the last 10 years as they bid for a sixth Davis Cup triumph. The win extends Ferrer's perfect record in clay-court Davis Cup singles rubbers. The 30-year-old has won all 16 of his matches on the surface. "I'm very happy, this is a dream for me," Ferrer told the tournament's official website. "Another Davis Cup final, we won here at home in Gijon. "I won the last match against John Isner, who is a very good player, and this tie was never easy. "The atmosphere was unbelievable. They supported me all the time in the match. I want to enjoy this moment, I'm really happy." Injury robbed Spain of 11-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal, who is struggling with a knee problem. The final will be a repeat of the 2009 showpiece after Tomas Berdych's straight-sets win against Carlos Berlocq saw the Czech Republic seal a 3-1 victory over 2011 runners-up Argentina. World No. 45 Berlocq was drafted in for the singles match after Argentina's No. 1 Juan Martin del Porto was forced to withdraw from the tie through injury on Saturday. Berdych, a semifinalist at the recent U.S. Open, was rarely troubled by Berlocq and sealed a straight-forward 6-3 6-3 6-4 win, much to the disappointment of the Buenos Aires crowd. The Czech Republic will have home advantage for the final, which will take place between November 16-18.	1
Golfer Tiger Woods Tuesday addressed a racially-tinged remark made by his former caddy, telling reporters Steve Williams apologized and is not a racist. "It was a wrong thing to say, something that we both acknowledge," Woods _____golfLOS ANGELES (AP) — Tiger Woods said Tuesday he will be more cautious this week following a heated debate over racial intolerance in the wake of his comments on Twitter and an appearance on ABC's "Good Morning America" that drew criticism for distancing himself from race.Woods, whose ties to the African American community have been tested repeatedly over the years, told reporters after a practice round that he feels it is "important for black leaders and black leaders around the world to recognize that this is not the America that I grew up in and it's not the America that I love. This is not how it's supposed to be."Woods, a top-ranked and multi-time world player, has been the subject of criticism in recent years for comments he has made on race in interviews and over the past year after he was charged with assaulting his then-fiancee. After the charge was dropped in September, he was accused of making racially insensitive comments, such as referring to his "slave ancestors," and again sparked a Twitter controversy.Monday's announcement came hours after Woods' appearance on the "GMA," in which he appeared to leave open the possibility of embracing race as a factor in his golf game."I think I am open to that discussion," Woods said. "And in fact, I think it's pretty important for all of us in every walk of life to recognize that this is not the America that I grew up in and it's not the America that I love. This is not how it's supposed to be, and hopefully we'll continue to be able to discuss that," he said.Woods' comments drew the ire of fans, who criticized him for not acknowledging that his remarks were insensitive. In a written statement, he acknowledged he needs to be more sensitive with "things that are sensitive out there.""I am not perfect and I will continue to make mistakes and will continue to try to learn and grow from them, and that is what I have done this entire season," Woods said. "As I learned from my mistakes, the results have shown that I have improved and grown from them and that is the main focus right	0
The health of Yemen's wounded president is improving, but doctors are recommending that he stay in Saudi Arabia for a "longer time" to recover, an adviser said Friday. This came as thousands of anti-government protesters demonstrated across Yemen and five people died in an explosion at a military checkpoint in Aden. Yemeni ruling party officials had been saying that President Ali Abdullah Saleh would return home Friday from Saudi Arabia, where he was taken for treatment after he was wounded in a June 3 attack on the country's presidential palace. "Doctors recommended that President Saleh stays in Saudi Arabia for a longer time. They said that Saleh's health is improving," said Ahmed Al-Soufi, a senior presidential adviser in Yemen. "The health of President Saleh is important to us, and we hope he will be here within days." The biggest demonstrations are taking place in Sanaa, Taiz, Hodieda, and Ibb provinces, witnesses said, and the protesters condemned U.S. and Saudi interference in Yemeni political affairs. Demonstrators chanted, "The people reject U.S. interference" and "the revolution will prevail." "We want the revolution to succeed, and the U.S. is not making this possible," said Sabreen Ariki, a leading figure in the Youth Revolutionary Movement in Taiz. "It is killing the revolution, but we want to tell them that we will continue protesting until our demands are met." Members of the Revolution Youth Organizing Committee, one of the groups in the Youth Revolutionary Movement in Yemen, condemned Saudi Arabia and the United States for what they said was the negative influence both countries are having on Yemen and promised that the countries' stance against the revolution will not be forgotten. "It has become clear that the Saudi stance is against the will of the people and they are seeking their own interests while ignoring the interests of the Yemeni people," said Waseem Qirshi, a committee representative. In Sanaa, tens of thousands of Saleh followers gathered in support of him, demanding that the international community respect its constitutional president and not violate the Yemeni Constitution. In New York, members of the U.N. Security Council expressed "grave concern" Friday about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Yemen.	1
Allied forces suffered a day of heavy losses in Afghanistan Friday after a helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and an attack killed four French soldiers, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal. The Marines died after  a C-130 transport plane crashed on a military base. Officials originally said that four France troops died but the cause of the crash was determined to be a ground collision by NATO troops. A U.S. spokesperson said initial indications suggested that the accident occurred on the ground, not in the air, and that the aircraft was "unable to make a safe return to base and subsequently crash-landed."The Marine aircraft, a MH-60 MHA and a CH-53E Super Stallion, were returning to Camp Bastion after a mission to the Afghan village of Qalat. It was the second crash of coalition aircraft this week. At least 16 coalition aircraft were damaged in the first 24 hours of the fight. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said the deaths were the result of a ground collision.Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said he ordered a formal investigation into the crash. He also said the United States is sending additional forces to Afghanistan for training.The four French soldiers were identified as Sergeant Nicolas Desfrançois, 23, of the 3rd Foreign Parachute Regiment, and Sergeants Pierre-Jean-Yves Devallet, 25, and Sergeants Jean-Paul Leger-Chaumette, 24, of the 1st Foreign Parachute Company. These men were killed in the crash, along with their fellow countryman, Sergeant Michel-Benoit Bertin, 41, of the 3rd Parachute Company.In a statement, the French Ministry of Defense said that the accident had been caused by "an accident in the area of operations involving a French fighter aircraft when attempting to land at the base. Following the incident, the aircraft has been identified and removed." The investigation, it said, was under way and it had nothing to hide. The French Ministry of Defense said it was looking forward to receiving the investigation findings, as well as assurances that the French military will not take part in any future attacks in the region of Afghanistan.A statement issued by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, meanwhile, said, "the Afghan Government takes note of the tragic and unspeakable loss of life suffered by all those who were killed in the	0
A car bomb killed one of Israel's most prominent crime bosses in Srebrenica, sparking outrage in EuropeThe bomb, planted in an Audi Q3, killed Hato Himpsel, leader of the Osdagdo crime gang and former commander of the SS, which terrorized and murdered over 700 peopleThe car bomb, which was planted in an Audi Q3, used RDX, a highly flammable chemical, and could have melted the door on its ownThe bomb caused the car to burst into flamesA car bomb, which exploded outside a luxury hotel in Jerusalem killing two people and injuring 40, may have been planted by an off-duty IDF intelligence officer turned terrorist.The improvised explosive device, which was found in the Audi's undercarriage in a Jaffa neighborhood, was apparently placed by an Israeli counterterrorism officer who also blew up himself two days earlier by swinging a grenade at IDF soldiers.The two explosive charges in the car, which exploded as Hato Himpsel was driving it at a high speed through a residential area, were placed on the left rear wheel and right side of the car.The car itself was a rental from the company that made it. Both the rental business and the company that made the car failed to provide details on the car's identification number. In fact, no car rental company would let Hato Himpsel take a car without a number plate.The bomb, which contained four grenades and a bomb-laden device that may have exploded a few minutes after the first explosion, was found by a paramedic who was driving in a car near the main entrance to the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem on Wednesday. It was then detonated by IDF soldiers standing on the street corner. The car then burst into flames and began to roll back down the hill."I heard a rumbling noise and felt a shock wave in my ears. I pulled up and saw the car stopped. There was a second explosion and I saw the car begin to fire. I closed my eyes and started waving my arms."One of the soldiers who responded to the bomb call also noticed a civilian	0
Afghan insurgents who staged a daring, well-planned raid on Camp Bastion, the military base where Britain's Prince Harry is deployed, were wearing U.S. Army uniforms, NATO said a day after the attack. It's extremely rare for Afghan insurgents to use U.S. uniforms in their attacks. The last time CNN can identify was more than two years ago, when NATO repelled attacks on two bases in Khost province in August 2010. No coalition troops were killed in that attack, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said at the time. At least two U.S. Marines were killed in the brazen strike late on Friday, and six jets were destroyed, ISAF said as it released more details about the raid. Well-trained, well-rehearsed fighters carried out the sustained assault in Helmand province, ISAF said. About 15 insurgents organized into three teams penetrated the base's perimeter fence and did considerable damage, destroying six refueling stations and damaging six aircraft hangars. The attackers toted automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. They destroyed six AV-8B Harrier jets and damaged two others before the attack ended, the coalition said. Fourteen of the fighters were killed and one was wounded and captured, ISAF said. Eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded. It is too soon to say whether the attackers had "inside knowledge," ISAF spokesman James Graybeal said. ISAF would not say how the attackers got the uniforms, but CNN staff who have spent time in Afghanistan say they are for sale in markets there. There has been at least one other case of Afghan insurgents wearing U.S. uniforms, in May 2010. And in Iraq five years ago, there was a dramatic and successful raid using the tactic. Attackers wearing what appeared to be American uniforms were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of five U.S. soldiers in Karbala, Iraq, in 2007. Prince Harry is an Apache helicopter pilot based at Camp Bastion, but the British Ministry of Defence categorically rejected reports in Sunday's British press that he was just a few hundred yards away from the gun battle. Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, "was in no way in any danger" during the latest attack, ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said earlier.	1
A Europe-wide scandal over horse meat in products labeled beef spread still further Friday, as UK authorities revealed the results of DNA testing on beef products and raided the premises of three more UK food firms. Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the UK Food Standards Agency said. The 29 positive tests involved seven products sold by five suppliers, according to the Food Standards Agency. Another 962 tests are still under way, the agency said at a news conference. Fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by frozen food giant Findus that first triggered the horse meat alert last week. The others concerned beef products sold by supermarket chains Tesco, Aldi and The Co-operative, and burgers made by catering supplier Rangeland. Tesco, Asda and Aldi all issued statements saying they are boosting testing on meat products to protect customers, restore confidence and ensure product quality. Jim Smith, group technical director for Tesco, said the company will "no longer work with the suppliers who fell below our very high standards." The Food Standards Agency declined to give details of the names or location of the three food premises raided Friday. Investigations are ongoing, but authorities cannot rule out the possibility of arrests, it said. The latest raids come a day after UK authorities arrested three workers at two meat plants, Farmbox Meats near Aberystywth and Peter Boddy Slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Inspectors toured the plants Tuesday and suspended their permits to operate Wednesday, the agency said. Meanwhile, authorities in northern England confirmed Friday that a dish had been pulled from 47 school kitchens after tests revealed horse DNA. The ready-made cottage pie, or shepherd's pie, came from an external supplier, the Lancashire County Council said. "This does not appear to be a food safety issue but I've no doubt parents will agree we need to take a very firm line with suppliers," councilor Susie Charles said in a prepared statement. Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products. Fears of mislabeled meat also spread to the sky, where companies that provide in-flight catering in Europe initiated reviews of their suppliers.	1
This should be the day Nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the World Economic Forum in Africa. It is the first time the West African country has hosted the VIP event since the Geneva-based WEF came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted. Focus is now on the Nigeria's list of problems in the North: kidnappings, terrorist attacks and killings. The country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years, humming along at around 7%. It is at the heart of what many define as an African Renaissance. After decades of loans from international lenders such as the World Bank, high debt and little development, Africa is coming alive. That is why Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global CEOs to their turf. But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam. These groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization. The WEF is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more, not less, globalization. The best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income. Let's start in the financial capital of Lagos and work our way North. In Lagos, it is pegged at just over $2,900, according to a survey by Renaissance Capital. In the political capital of Abuja, where the economic forum is taking place, it rises to $4,000. But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just $1,631. There is an overemphasis on farming, very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states. In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker. Poverty and violence often go hand-in-hand, and that is the case here. Nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region. One cannot overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high-profile business forum. But at the same time one cannot ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption.	1
A security guard was killed and five others were injured when a car packed with explosives detonated Saturday in Mogadishu, officials said. The blast occurred in a seaside restaurant parking lot in the capital, Somali police Col. Ali Hassan told CNN. No group had claimed responsibility by late Saturday. The wail of sirens echoed as residents and firefighters rushed to put out flames and smoke from scorched vehicles in the parking lot.	1
A month after carrying out one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, federal authorities have added charges and broadened their case against the defendants. The 90-page superseding indictment, which was returned Thursday in the ʿEastern District of Virginia, now names six defendants who were indicted by a grand jury in mid-June.As suspected by the government, the defendants were operating a large-scale “piracy business” by selling and distributing digital media and facilitating the importation and possession of such media.“The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly engaged in a campaign to distribute thousands of copyrighted works over the Internet in violation of the Copyright Act,” the indictment says.Although the business was focused on U.S. customers, the indictment alleges that they also sought to sell these works overseas, in countries such as Iraq, Libya, Kenya, Afghanistan and Vietnam.The superseding indictment adds new defendants and charges them with various racketeering and copyright violations related to the operation of the business and its online distribution of illegal content.Several of the new charges are related to the operation of the business itself -- the defendants allegedly paid for Internet, phone and cable service to distribute the infringing content they sold. A third charge is for the distribution of unlawful content.Another charge, related to a payment card, alleges that the defendants charged each other for the use of the payment card to buy illegal content.U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton, who handed down this sentence, noted that the defendants would be subject to a “substantial” prison sentence.“These defendants have engaged in a multi-faceted, sophisticated plan of criminal conduct designed and operated to exploit the copyright laws for the purpose of depriving the public of the fruits of intellectual property,” he wrote. “This conduct has caused severe economic harm to the entertainment industry, harmed the public by the loss of valued art works, and caused irreparable harm to the reputations of those defendants who did not engage in illegal conduct.”The defendants are James Scott, 26, of Richmond; Johnathan Bierman, 59, of Alexandria, Va.; Kevin Warshaw, 27, of McLean; Peter Warshaw, 52, of Alexandria; and Christopher Warshaw, 43, of McLean. The defendants are all believed to be based in the United	0
Four current and former employees of Britain's Sun newspaper were arrested by authorities investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police, News Corp. and police said Saturday. Police searched the men's homes as well as the East London offices of News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that publishes the Sun and other U.K. newspapers, London's Metropolitan Police Service said. A 29-year-old police officer was also arrested Saturday at the central London police station where he works, police said, on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy in relation to both offenses. He works for the force's Territorial Policing command. Three of the men were arrested at their homes -- two of them, aged 49 and 57, in the county of Essex, and one aged 48 in London. A fourth, aged 42, was arrested at an east London police station. By late Saturday, police said that all five men were subsequently released after posting bail. The current and past newspaper employees were all set to "return pending further inquiries" in April or May, according to the Scotland Yard statement. Earlier, they'd been questioned on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to those offenses. The operation "relates to suspected payments to police officers and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately," an earlier police statement said. News Corp. said it is cooperating with the search of its News International offices. Police said the operation was the result of information provided to police by News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee (MSC), which was set up to look into conduct at News International, a subsidiary of News Corp. The News Corp. statement said the company had "made a commitment last summer that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past would not be repeated." The committee was asked "to proactively co-operate with law enforcement and other authorities if potentially relevant information arose at those titles. As a result of that review, which is ongoing, the MSC provided information to the Elveden investigation which led to today's arrests." The Sun, which is Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper, was the sister paper of News International's now-defunct Sunday title, the News of the World. A spokeswoman for News International earlier declined to comment on the search of its offices.	1
Outraged by a court verdict they considered too lenient, thousands of people took to the streets across Bangladesh on Wednesday demanding the death penalty for an Islamic party leader convicted of war crimes carried out more than four decades ago.  The rally, which began at 5 a.m. and ended with a prayer against the verdict, brought thousands of people together in both the capital and the western Rangpur district, a stronghold of the party that helped power the military dictatorship."Our people want death to be executed against Sheikh Hasina," said a protester at the rally, holding a noose. "And the world should help us in executing this verdict."  Other protesters hung red banners that said "Death to Sheikh Hasina" and "Death to the Sheikh."The rallies were supported by other opposition parties, in addition to the two main parties that dominated the country during the 1970s and 1980s: Awami League, a secular, liberal nationalist group; and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), a nationalist party with its roots in Islam that ruled its founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mujib was killed in a military coup in 1975 and the party was banned in 1996 after the genocide of the people of East Pakistan.The BNP-dominated government has been trying to negotiate a way out of the case to avoid a wave of national protests. It has offered leniency in the sentencing, and the verdict is expected to go unpunished, pending negotiations with the Awami League.In a separate incident on Wednesday, the ruling party's top leadership was questioned in a high-level inquiry. The party has ordered an indefinite crackdown on all pro-democracy organizations.The government's crackdown has been supported by its supporters in the military. The military chief, Gen. Ashrafuzzaman Khan, has said the ruling party is "too liberal." The BNP-led government and its supporters fear that a major uprising by the people will not help the ruling party or its leader's political survival in a general election due early next year.The Awami League and its parliamentary allies have also said that the BNP's hardline position on the case is likely to be a major hindrance to a political solution.The government's decision to put off a trial may now be a major issue in its national election strategy, as it will raise questions about the Awami League's legitimacy and will	0
A tropical depression that is likely to become a tropical storm by Sunday has areas of the islands of the Bahamas on guard. The Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning Saturday evening for portions of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos. CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray said Saturday the storm is a bit "ragged" but over the next day or so is likely to organize and strengthen. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast track, the storm is likely to stay just east of the United States' Atlantic coast. However, Gray said any sort of deviation from the forecast path later this week could result in high surf and rip currents in areas along the U.S. coast.	1
Alex Okosi left Nigeria as a young boy in the late 1980s to seek a better future in the United States. By the early 2000s, the music executive was carving a successful career with broadcasting giant MTV, holding strategic positions within the influential medial company both in the United States and Europe. Yet, Okosi never forgot where he came from. His dream had always been to promote his continent's diverse music scene and vibrant youth culture. In the mid-2000s, at a time when not many were convinced about his continent's economic potential, Okosi helped persuade his bosses to launch a dedicated MTV channel for Africa. Today, as the senior vice president and managing director of MTV Networks Africa, Okosi runs MTV Base, the company's first localized television service targeted exclusively at sub-Saharan Africa. "We've ... been quite lucky in being able to create a brand that we have taken from our international stable and bring into the continent to be able to create content and experiences that people enjoy, localizing them to make sure that they cater to the attitudes and tastes of African audiences," says Okosi, now based in South Africa. Read related: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers Born in the West African country of Nigeria, Okosi moved to the United States at the age of 12. He excelled throughout school, graduated with high honors in 1994 and won a scholarship to St. Michael's college in Vermont. He credits his mentor Midge Monte for shaping his character and showing him the value of working hard to achieve your goals. "Midge was such an important an influential part of my life as she served as my guardian the last two years of my high school career and has since remained a huge part of my life," says Okosi. "Midge also instilled in me the importance of hard work and commitment as one strives to be successful." Okosi's determination and academic excellence helped him land a job with MTV straight after university. His talents soon started to shine -- Okosi worked both in MTV's New York and West Coast offices before moving to London to be part of the company's international strategy team. He first planted the seed of bringing MTV to Africa during a business lunch with the head of the broadcasting giant. Okosi was convinced about the power and value of the African market, but putting together a viable business plan was far from easy -- a lack of data on the size of the advertising market, coupled with infrastructure challenges, hampered Okosi's ambitions.	1
Since March 11, the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Here is the latest on Â¿The Unintended ConsequencesÂ¿.At the start of November the first two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant began their shutdown. The reactors will remain offline until at least the end of March. Although the three remaining reactors have not been affected, the two units that have been shut down are expected to remain inactive for a long time and to leak radioactive material.In an interview with Radio Japan, the chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) says, “I am sorry, but the nuclear emergency may continue for a long time.” At the start of the interview the chairman says that “the emergency conditions have changed.”The interview appears on the web site of Asahi Shimbun. It was translated by Radio Asia. Read more...The following article appeared in The New Republic on December 5, 2011:There is an error in the following article.

And, it is also known that foreign aid is not always used according to their stated intentions or the wishes of the recipient countries. In the case of Burma, for example, the country has received more than $11 billion in foreign aid in its history, but as recently as five years ago that had grown to more than $30 billion and, for the most part, was used to assist in economic development. Today, when Burma has been in the midst of a civil war for almost half a century, and one of the world’s longest human rights conflicts, the country is still awaiting the outcome of this most recent round of international aid money – the $8.5 million that was pledged in January for the completion of the country’s road-building program.As the international community has largely ignored the fate of the war-torn country for the last several decades, while the country is now faced with an economic crisis that	0
To the unaccustomed eye, a man toting 120 books while riding a stubborn donkey would seem nothing short of a circus spectacle. But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown. He is a man with a mission to save rural children from illiteracy. "There was a time when many people thought that I was going crazy," said Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia. "They'd yell, 'Carnival season is over.' ... Now I've overcome that." Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a "biblioburro," a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as "abandoned regions" in the Colombian state of Magdalena. "In [rural] regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools," Soriano said. "The children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school. ...There are [few] teachers that would like to teach in the countryside." Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes At the start of his 17-year teaching career, Soriano realized that some students were having difficulty not just learning, but finishing their homework assignments. Most of the students falling behind lived in rural villages, where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies. To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children. "I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea [to use] them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load," Soriano said. "I put the books on their backs in saddles and they became my work tools." Every Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named Alfa. A second donkey, Beto, follows behind, toting additional books and a sitting blanket. They visit 15 villages on a rotating basis. "It's not easy to travel through the valleys," Soriano said. "You sit on a donkey for five or eight hours, you get very tired. It's a satisfaction to arrive to your destination."	1
and hotly disputed -- air defense zone above the East China Sea on Thursday, the same day that Japan's military firmly insisted its own patrols over the area wouldn't stop because of Beijing's declaration. The People's Liberation Army Air Â­ Force in China's second-largest province of Xinjiang has been carrying out regular patrols over the South China Sea since last month, the country's defense ministry said. It said the patrols were aimed at countering threats to Chinese sovereignty.But Chinese ships and aircraft continue to patrol the East China Sea, the ministry said. The zone would extend 400 nautical miles from the coast, Beijing said, meaning the country could cut off Chinese fishermen from their traditional fishing grounds around the Paracel Islands, an uninhabited chain of atolls in the South China Sea that are also claimed by Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.Chinese state television has shown pictures of the defense zone in the east on Thursday, with one showing Chinese military aircraft patrolling a "red-and-white" area marking the Chinese-claimed East China Sea."The Chinese people are the world's biggest consumers of rice. The East China Sea has become one of the world's largest ports for rice, with China's fishermen and coastal areas becoming highly vulnerable when the sea is full of ships," said Huang Yaqing, a government-sanctioned academic specializing in the study of China's border waters, at a seminar in Singapore.Beijing has repeatedly rebuffed accusations from the West over the buildup of Chinese forces in the East China Sea.Last week, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague rejected a ruling by a panel of international judges asking China to end its maritime construction in the sea. The court said the measures by Beijing "violate international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."China's coast guard and navy have been in the East China Sea for years and they have made repeated attempts to keep Chinese fishermen confined to their fishing grounds. It was the latest attempt by the Chinese government to assert sovereignty over fishing grounds as the nation's fishermen have a long history over claims to territory in Southeast Asia. Critics said Beijing was stoking the fears of Taiwan, an island the mainland claims as its own, by claiming that the maritime zone in the sea included Taiwan.In August, Reuters reported that Chinese state television displayed images of fishermen in the South China Sea wearing yellow hats and	0
Everything is awesome for the team behind "The LEGO Movie." The 3-D animated extravaganza is estimated to have earned a spectacular $69.11 million this weekend — the biggest opening of the still young year, and the second largest February opening ever (the top spot belongs to 2004′s "Passion of the Christ"). The Phil Lord and Christopher Miller movie blew past studio and analyst predictions, which had the pic in the $40 to $55 million range. Playing in 3,775 theaters, most of which were in 3-D, "LEGO" scored an incredible $18,307 per location average, and, including overseas profits ($18.1 million from 34 territories), "The LEGO Movie" has already stacked up $87.2 million. 'The Lego Movie': Did it make you cry? "The LEGO Movie" is Warner Bros.' first animated release in three years. Village Roadshow co-financed the pic. Featuring the vocal talents of Chris Pratt as Emmet the construction worker, Will Ferrell as the evil Lord Business, Elizabeth Banks as the brilliant Wyldstyle, Liam Neeson as Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman, "LEGO" resonated with both adults and children — 60 percent of the audience was over 18 years old. A sequel is reportedly already in the works. But it wasn't just families and kids who headed out to the theaters this weekend. George Clooney's $70 million WWII pic "The Monuments Men" (CinemaScore: B+) exceeded expectations and took in an estimated $22.7 million from 3,083 locations. Based on a true story, "The Monuments Men" follows a team tasked with recovering art from the Nazis and returning it to their rightful owners and stars Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett. The audience was divided fairly evenly (48 percent male), and 75 percent of attendees were over 35 years old.	1
Devastation is devastation, whether a hurricane rips up your home or a tornado takes the person you love most in the world. It's loss, shock and confusion. It's anger and sadness and resentment. It's being flustered like you've never been flustered before. But it's going to be OK: Take it from the people who survived Hurricane Katrina and the Missourians from Joplin whose town was leveled by the worst tornado in U.S. history. They want Sandy survivors to know a few things: You're probably on autopilot right now. You're moving through it. Stand in the ruins of the life you had before the disaster. Understand that was before. The after is when you're good and ready. 7 ways to manage stress in a disaster Hours will still go by though. Days will happen. You might not remember to eat because you're filling out paperwork and talking to insurance operators. You will get put on hold. Your life will feel forever on hold. At some point, when you think you're handling it, you will stumble on something that reminds you of that old life, maybe it's a thing or it's a memory. Maybe this will happen when you finally get the sleep you've gone without since the disaster. You're going to feel really, really awful again for awhile. Victims fall to Mother Nature's wrath Make yourself anew Eileen Romero still feels the weight on her chest. It has just gotten a little lighter in the years since Katrina. As a nurse, she saw heinous things in the hospital where she worked. Eight years on, it's hard to speak in full sentences without crying. She watched the wall-to-wall television coverage of Hurricane Sandy, transfixed by the nurses who manually pumped air into newborns after carrying the infants down nine fights of stairs at NYU Langone Medical Center. "I was right back in that hospital in New Orleans," Romero said. "I know those people. I felt that." There are always burdens and rewards of being a caregiver. But in an emergencies, they are tenfold.	1
In a show of adoration, a small group of Jenni Rivera's fans waited outside Long Beach Airport, as the plane carrying the music star's remains landed late Thursday. They greeted members of her family with applause and iced teas, and waved their children to greet the plane.The plane was met by a fleet of cars that had been commandeered for the occasion. Drivers and police officers rode horses and two limousines in the parking lot, escorted by mounted police riding their horses."You know, Jenni Rivera was my hero," said Robert Martinez, of Mission Viejo, Calif., who was visiting his mom in Oceanside, Calif., about an hour west of Long Beach."I've grown up loving her music, and she was a huge part of the Hispanic culture here."On Thursday, Rivera, whose musical style and outspoken nature have made her a prominent figure in music and in the media, was taken to meet a small number of her friends and family. Then, about four days after she had been found dead, she was laid to rest in Forest Lawn Cemetery in the city where she had lived.The day and the evening were filled with the family and friends of a singer and actress whose work and life had been lived by far more than her death.When she died in August, fans gathered at her home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, and from there, her funeral procession was streamed live on Facebook.The body of the popular singer and TV personality, whose hits included "I Never Knew," "All By Myself" and "One More Night," was discovered three weeks ago, as the result of a mysterious fall from her Malibu home.The autopsy showed that she was killed by a single gunshot to the head, but the manner of death was kept secret until the time of her funeral.After being identified, Rivera's family expressed gratitude that the cause of her death was never made public."I don't understand why this has to remain a secret," said her brother, Javier, who lives in Las Vegas."I'm a big fan; I have every music CD in my collection, some of her songs, so I wish the media would report the truth and let the truth be known."In addition to having a huge number of dedicated fans, Rivera was popular in the Hispanic community for her	0
Leave it to Kanye. The hip-hop mega star may have had the last word of 2014. In the waning hours of the year, he released a new song that's sure to get folks talking. Just not for the reasons we've come to expect from Kanye West. In place of his usual bombast, "Only One" boasts a spare arrangement. In it, an AutoTuned Kanye tenderly sings from the perspective of his late mother as she looks down from the heavens and addresses him. "Hello my only one, just like the morning sun/ You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name," the song's chorus goes. In it, the mother says she talked to God who sent down angels for Kanye. "You asked for one and you got two" -- a reference to his wife, Kim Kardashian, and their daughter, North. The song ends with the refrain, "Tell Nori about me." Nori is North's nickname. Oh, did we mention, the single also features Paul McCartney. "Paul played the piano," tweeted Mike Dean who produced the song. The single is now available on iTunes.	1
The U.S. Justice Department is suing the state of California and Gov. Jerry Brown because prison authorities required a Sikh  inmate to cut off his dreadlocks.In July, a California superior court judge ordered a federal magistrate to hold hearings on the matter and to decide by Oct. 6 whether to compel the state to comply with U.S. Constitutional requirements.The suit claims the state’s prison system violated the First, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. In a federal district court hearing on the matter, Judge Cormac Carney, a Clinton appointee, ruled the prison practice was “an egregious violation of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”Here are the details:In May 2015, the district court Judge presiding over the case, Judge Cormac Carney, ordered a Magistrate Judge to hold hearings on the issue of whether the prison system violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. He issued a ruling in favor of Sikh’s religious freedom and ordered the state to comply with the ruling. Sikh’s attorney, Robert MacLean filed an appeal to a Superior Court Judge, which affirmed the decision to hold hearings. A decision was issued by the Superior Court Judge. Attorney MacLean appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit again, which upheld the ruling. Attorney MacLean then appealed to the Supreme Court. The US Supreme Court did not grant hearing and the case was returned back to the 9th Circuit.The federal government wants the state to remove from public records the name of the prison that imposed the restrictions. They also want a name placed on the prison list used by prison authorities when prisoners are transferred from one prison to another.A copy of the original lawsuit can be found here.If you’re interested in hearing what prison authorities had to say then you can listen below.Watch this video to learn more about the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin on Facebook.(VN: an earlier version of this story incorrectly said the case was from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and it should have said Superior Court Judge, John A.

Government troops fought fresh battles with opposition fighters in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, early Friday as the country's embattled president tried to put down a tribal revolt. Troops backed by tanks were nearing the home of Â©mr. Abdullah Badr, a prominent tribal elder, when he tried to flee in his pickup truck, which crashed into a wall and was overturned, killing several of his bodyguards.Â©mr. Badr's two sons were killed and two others wounded in the crash. His wife and a fourth bodyguard were also injured.Houthi spokesman Ahmed al-Jarba said members of the Saudi-led coalition were responsible for the crash, which he blamed on the coalition and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Iran, a leading financial backer of the Houthis and a bitter enemy of Saudi Arabia, denied the charge. Iran's state news agency, which is close to the government, said the crash was the result of "unauthorized acts" by the Saudi-led coalition, adding that the coalition was "protecting its troops."Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the state news agency IRNA that the coalition had a "moral responsibility" for the crash and that this was an attempt by "foreign forces to impose their point of view on Yemen."The coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, has been accused of supporting Yemen's rebels by allowing them to cross into the country from neighboring Saudi Arabia, and later by supplying them with arms and funding.Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Yemen, said: "The U.S. is aware of this and is probably trying to keep this in-house as a political maneuver, while keeping a distance from the actual situation. The Gulf states are in an awkward position because they are supporting the most brutal and powerful rebels in the region, and the U.S. government is essentially siding with those same rebels."The U.S. is trying to make these Gulf countries accountable, by insisting that they intervene to stop the bloodshed, and perhaps they are even attempting to make them fight on each other's side in Yemen."Tribal tensionsThe Saudi-led coalition has been accused by human rights groups of a campaign of war crimes and widespread violations in the country's poorest country.

Rockets flew between Israel and Hamas as tensions in the region continue their upward climb. Hamas security sources reported at least 60 Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Monday night into Tuesday, including from F-16s, Apache ́s and Mi-8 helicopters."Our security forces are dealing with a serious and dangerous terrorism campaign which consists of direct cross-border attacks and the use of human shields," U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said at a news conference in Jerusalem following an IDF investigation of a Palestinian gunman who shot and killed a teenager, and injured several Israeli soldiers, in a border area last week.The attacks are part of an intensifying war of words and the threat of retaliation from Hamas, a terrorist organization which, along with other Islamist groups, has fought Israel for more than half a century, and is currently engaged in an armed confrontation with Israel in the Gaza Strip."We are very much concerned about continued escalation by the terrorist organizations who are seeking to disrupt the Middle East peace process and our efforts to promote the creation of a Palestinian state," Shapiro said.Israel, for its part, is responding to rocket barrages by Hamas in Gaza with a barrage of airstrikes of its own which have included the use of helicopters.The IDF has conducted over 300 aerial sorties in the past 24 hours alone, with an average of 10 to 15 per hour. A large number of the rockets fired from Gaza into Israel have originated in Egypt, where the Hamas movement has a strong base of support.While Israel is the only country in the region to have launched significant combat patrols into Gaza, this week's violence represents a continuation of the fighting, as Hamas responds to the most recent Israeli offensive with its own."This is the fifth military offensive in Gaza this year, and the second one in December. Hamas is launching a new, more lethal, and more determined attack against Israel. This time we have seen a major escalation in rocket fire which threatens our citizens and our residents, who must be constantly on alert at all times."Rockets fired from Gaza into Israel are not new, but the new tactic is.In the last three weeks alone, more than 40 rockets have been launched at Israel, bringing the total number of rockets into Israel to more than 700, according to the IDF.On Saturday and Sunday, Hamas fired about 40 rockets over a short period, followed by a barrage of	0

Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she won't vote for any more money to support the four-year-old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton greets people before speaking in Washington on September 17. "I've reached the conclusion that the best way to support our troops is begin bringing them home," the New York senator and former first lady told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer." "I don't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open-ended commitment, that has no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the tough political decisions they have to make, or which really gives any urgency to the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts." Clinton's declaration comes as the Senate debates the Defense Department's 2008 spending authorization bill. It follows her vote against a $120 billion war-spending bill in May, when Congress dropped a call for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 2008 after President Bush vetoed a bill containing that provision. "The president has no intention of changing his policy in Iraq," she said. "He's now talking about leaving it to his successor." Meanwhile, the Senate's Republican minority routinely filibusters Democratic proposals to wind down the war, which is costing the Treasury about $10 billion a month and has claimed the lives of nearly 3,800 American troops. May's spending bill made continued U.S. support contingent on a set of benchmarks for Iraq's government. But the Iraqis met only 11 of the 18 benchmarks, according to the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. "Even those who are implementing this policy of the president's cannot tell us it will make America more safe, nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision-making that we have to expect from the Iraqis themselves," Clinton said. Nearly two-thirds of the American public now opposes the war, according to a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted in early September. Clinton said, if elected president, she would end the conflict "as quickly and responsibly as I can," but said some U.S. forces would likely remain as trainers, to protect Americans and to battle Islamic militants loyal to al Qaeda. The two-term senator, who leads her Democratic presidential rivals by a double-digit margin in national polls, made the rounds of all five Washington talk shows Sunday.	1
Of course the TV series Miami Vice seems dated now, but it's not just because Don Johnson's white Armani suits and slip-on shoes belong to a mercifully bygone era. The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one  we've known since the seventies and eighties. I live in an old house on the border of Biscayne and Miami. My two best friends now live in New York City. It's a far cry from our days when we used to drink Pabst Blue Ribbon at the bar when we wanted to be the last person in our dorm to go home at 4 a.m.So where has all the change come from? I'm not talking about the development boom in South Beach. In fact, I'm pretty sure that there hasn't been one in South Florida since the '80s. We have a lot in common: We like to party, eat, and enjoy the beach. But the South Florida of my youth is a very different place than the South Florida I see every day.The South Florida of my childhood was a very different place from the South Florida of my teens. There was a tremendous amount of poverty in the Miami-Dade county area, and the kids had a very tough time. This, in part, allowed me to live a double life. I was a successful child and teenager and then a successful adult without losing my identity. In fact, I gained a great deal of it, especially after my first wife, who is African-American, and I moved to Atlanta in 1986.I was living in a small apartment in a large urban area, earning a decent wage, and enjoying living in a city with a substantial African-American population. We had a good life. The biggest challenge for me was trying to blend in. But I didn't want Miami to look and behave like Atlanta. So I decided to create a world that was completely mine. There were no other African-American parents in my house. I wouldn't let anyone into my house and life. No friends were invited because we would be ostracized by our own family. I took advantage of the best thing about America, which is that anyone who lives here, everyone, is free to define themselves. There were no limits. I was very free, but I was smart enough to take advantage of all the advantages of being white and middle-class.This freedom	0
With moist eyes and soft voices, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges on Wednesday related to years of using campaign funds for personal expenses that included purchases of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a Rolex watch. "Guilty, your honor," Jackson responded to U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins while dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief after he looked back at family members in the courtroom, including his father, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. "I used monies that should have been used for campaign purposes," Jackson, 47, acknowledged to the judge. When Wilkins asked if Jackson realized that the guilty plea meant giving up the right to a trial, he responded: "I have no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money." Jackson admitted to diverting about $750,000 for personal purposes from 2005 to 2012. Wilkins set sentencing for June 28, when Jackson could face up to five years in prison. At a separate hearing later on Wednesday, former Chicago Alderman Sandra Stevens Jackson, 49, also pleaded guilty in a quavering voice to one count of filing false tax returns in connection with the misuse of her husband's campaign funds. The charge involved a failure to declare more than $600,000 in income from 2005 to 2011. The total came from campaign funds. She wept openly after returning to the defense table. Wilkins set her sentencing for July 1, when she could receive up to three years in prison. Wednesday's hearings completed the fall of the once politically powerful Chicago couple. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat, won re-election to Congress last year despite personal problems, including a mood disorder, that caused him to drop out of sight for months during the campaign. That coincided with the investigation of campaign fund irregularities dating back several years. Jackson resigned a few weeks after the election, while his wife resigned her position as alderman in January. Prosecutors said the former congressman betrayed the public trust. "The guilty plea today is so tragic because it represents such wasted potential. Jesse Jackson Jr. had drive the ability and the talent to be the voice of a new generation, but he squandered that talent. He exchanged that instead to satisfy his personal whims and extravagant lifestyle," U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said at a news conference. As he left the courthouse following his wife's hearing, Jackson said to reporters: "I'm sorry I let everybody down."	1
Panasonic halted operations at three factories in China after angry protesters ransacked Japanese businesses over the weekend amid rising tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Violence against Japanese erts in China is rare, but has been escalating since Tokyo protested at a Chinese navy naval drills on disputed islands in the East China Sea in late August.On Sunday, Japanese firms, including automobile manufacturers Honda and Toyota, along with the aircraft-makers Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, were hit by angry protests in Chinese factories. At least seven Japanese businesses and media companies, including newspaper Nikkei, were looted after Japanese firms joined a long-running boycott of Chinese products."The Japanese companies can't bear the damage of this boycott," a Japanese source told Reuters. "The boycott will become even more aggressive."Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Noriyuki Suga told a news conference in Tokyo that Japanese businesses were "deeply worried" about the future of their businesses in the wake of the protest."Japan believes the boycott of China will not help Japan's economic development and must be discontinued. We have reported this to the Chinese side as it concerns the two sides themselves," he said.Suga said that Japanese firms would monitor the situation closely.After the Japanese firm Honda, which makes vehicles for the United States and other cars, announced it was suspending its vehicle-building operations at three Chinese factories, the Japanese source said: "There is high anxiety about the future of Japanese companies' manufacturing in China."The protests came as Chinese President Xi Jinping flew to Japan for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Japanese firms are struggling to recover from a prolonged slump and have been forced to close factories and slash production as the trade war between Tokyo and Beijing worsens. In August, Japan joined a long-running boycott against China of products including some autos and consumer electronics.The protests against the Japanese businesses followed days of violent unrest at a Chinese construction company in Zhoushan, a city in eastern China's Zhejiang province where a construction project was halted after workers went on strike, according to Chinese state media.A Japanese-owned construction firm, Nippon Zosen, was among the companies targeted, according to Japanese media reports.According to China’s news agency Xinhua, the company had asked employees to go back to work after a meeting with management at noon on	0
Lady Gaga singing "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You"? Martin Short leading a seeming cast of thousands (OK, dozens) doing "Yankee Doodle Dandy"? Bruno Mars performing "Message in a Bottle"? It can only be the Kennedy Center Honors. This year's broadcast, which aired Tuesday night, paid tribute to R&B great Al Green, the multitalented Sting, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks, dancer Patricia McBride and comedian Lily Tomlin. It's hard to do wrong with a Green song, and Earth, Wind & Fire led off with a heartfelt version of "Love and Happiness." The band was followed by such performers as Jennifer Hudson ("Simply Beautiful"), Usher ("Let's Stay Together") and Mavis Staples and Sam Moore ("Take Me to the River"). Green was visibly moved by the tribute. McBride was feted with performances by dancers including Tiler Peck and Misty Copeland, and Hanks enjoyed a speech from David Letterman and Short's song-and-dance routine. (Oh, and Pentatonix did "That Thing You Do!" from the 1996 movie Hanks directed, wrote and appeared in.) Tomlin received compliments from Garrison Keillor, Jane Fonda and Jane Lynch, among others. And then there was Sting. Gaga sang to him, giving "Faith in You" a little Green-esque soul. Herbie Hancock played for him. Bruce Springsteen, Mars and members of Sting's musical "The Last Ship" performed for him. An appreciative Hanks had an amusing way of sizing up the show. "It's not unlike a very healthy way of watching your life flash before you eyes," he said. The show was recorded December 7.	1
Emergency services and Australian military personnel stepped up the search Friday for dozens of people still missing in Queensland as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state's worst flooding in decades. One of the 15 ute in the area where the people were believed to have been taken was engulfed in floodwaters, local media reported.By Friday afternoon, Queensland's emergency services and volunteers had searched 521 hectares of the area where the 14 people were reported to have gone missing, ABC News reported. They had been digging through the mud in a search for bodies. "The ground is very soft and we are finding bodies underneath the ground and that is pretty sad," Australian Federal Police assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan told reporters.A woman holds a photograph of her missing daughter while looking for information about the whereabouts of missing Brisbane locals. (Reuters) More than 14 people were feared swept away by floodwaters on Friday in the Queensland town of Innisfail, with authorities saying one man may still be alive. A state government spokesman said authorities could not confirm if the missing people had been found but appealed for any "good Samaritan" to come forward. "We will not be abandoning this search even as flood waters rise and more rescue and search missions will be undertaken," the spokesman said. "No one is above the law and we are urging anyone who may know the whereabouts of these people from the Innisfail community to come forward.""This is a tragic situation." The missing: Innisfail, Queensland Read moreThe waters at Innisfail reached the high mark of 10m (33 feet) earlier in the day, but police said the latest flood levels were a third of that water level.Police said they were "not ruling out foul play" after reports circulated on social media of people lost in the waters."The priority now is to locate these people, who may have been swept into the river, and provide them with any assistance that they may need as they search for their loved ones," police said in a statement.Gaughan said one of the missing people was a woman in her 30s, the other 14 women and four men.A man believed to have been one of the missing told reporters he had been swimming at 6am but had not returned by 6pm.“The community is our priority,” the spokeswoman said. “We are appealing to anyone who may	0
Pascal Clemens arrived in Acapulco 17 years ago. The native of Germany who owns a real estate company in the Mexican beach resort says he immediately fell in love with the place. His original plan was to move to New York, but he couldn't get enough of the sunny beaches, friendly people, cool breezes, and above all, the spectacular weather in Acapulco. "It's not only good, it's excellent, it's outstanding, every day! Have you seen any rain here?," asks Clemens as he looks up to the deep blue sky standing by a sandy beach on a recent, pleasant morning. Temperatures in the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (about 30 Celsius), sunny skies, and cool breezes are among the main reasons why countless foreigners have made Acapulco their paradise for decades. Back in the 1950s, actor John Wayne owned the Hotel Los Flamingos, which was built on top of Acapulco's highest cliffs. Johnny Weissmuller, who played Tarzan in Hollywood films, spent the last four years of his life here and is buried in Acapulco. Latin pop sensation Luis Miguel lived here for many years as well. The Mexican beach resort is full of luxury homes overlooking the bays and mansions with private gardens. According to local officials, at least 3,000 foreigners including Americans, Canadians, and Europeans call Acapulco home. A recent wave of drug violence that has sent the murder rate soaring to more than 80 violent deaths per 100,000 people is keeping some tourists away, especially spring breakers who were no-shows this year. Acapulco, with a population of 1.2 million, had 1,010 violent deaths last year, according to the Acapulco morgue, marking a steady increase from previous years. But violence is apparently having only a minimal effect on the real estate market. "Right now the market is down in terms of sales, but the prices have maintained, surprisingly stable," says Clemens, who owns a property management, realty, and villas rental company called Beachfront Acapulco. The current situation is mildly affecting the luxury rental market. A $1.6 million home with two pools and six bedrooms located in the luxurious Las Brisas residential area used to rent for about $1,000 a day. Now it's down to about $700.	1
Authorities found four human bodies abandoned in the Arizona desert Thursday. Initial indications point to exposure as the probable cause of death, said Victor Brabble, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.The bodies were recovered Thursday night in the Gila River Valley, near the border town of Nogales, a border patrol official confirmed with The Associated Press. Authorities had been searching for the bodies since the morning after the bodies were found about 8 p.m. Thursday.  Authorities said the four bodies were found in scattered areas in the desert.Brabble said a forensic anthropology team of investigators and a crime scene team will work to identify the victims and determine their cause of death.  Brabble added that there are unconfirmed reports that an autopsy will be conducted on one of the bodies.He said it was not immediately clear whether Border Patrol agents have determined that they are related to the four bodies found near the U.S.-Mexico border. He said Border Patrol and U.S. Department of Justice officials have not been notified of the discovery of the bodies until now, possibly because of privacy considerations.  Customs and Border Protection officials said there are more than 100,000 illegal immigrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border every day. Of those, only 13 percent request asylum at the border and most are sent home.Brabble said it was unclear why the bodies were abandoned near the border. He said it appears they were possibly dumped by smugglers.One Border Patrol spokeswoman said Friday that authorities are investigating the deaths as a possible suicide.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The case of a missing 2-year-old boy who disappeared from an Arizona campground more than a week ago has turned into a criminal investigation, the Yavapai County sheriff announced Monday. Syler Newton was last seen shortly after midnight July 24, sleeping in a tent with the family at the Beaver Creek Campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. July 25, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag. "The sheriff's office believes Syler did not wander from the campground and he is presumably dead," Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told a news conference Monday. "The search effort is now in a recovery mode and the investigation has become criminal in nature." Waugh said investigators have spent the past three days searching more than 200 tons of garbage in a nearby landfill "to try to determine if in fact the boy's body was there." About 50 people, along with highly trained bloodhounds, had joined in the search for Syler, who was wearing only a diaper when he disappeared, according to Yavapai County Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn. The bloodhounds, normally used by the state Department of Corrections for tracking down escaped felons, failed to detect the boy's scent outside the immediate campground area, investigators said as they described an exhaustive search that included aerial surveillance, scuba teams and underwater cameras. "Anything we could have done in that area has been searched," one investigator said Monday. Syler was camping with his custodial mother, Christina Priem, and her children, when he disappeared. Priem has said she was in the process of adopting the boy from his biological mother. D'Evelyn said last week that that "there's no evidence" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, "but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated." About 25 other people were at the campgrounds the night of Syler's disappearance -- all of whom have cooperated with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.	1
October 9, 2014 From news in Texas concerning the Ebola virus to a storm in the Pacific threatening Japan, we cover a lot ive been to in the past month. We are all safe and healthy, but I do have two very real nightmares which still haunt me even though i sleep well at night. While i am very sad to see my home town torn apart by a violent civil war the truth is that it wont be long until I will be in a similar situation. The first is the fear of the unknown. There is a real question i still hope to be able to answer. What exactly is the real threat in the world, and what can i do to protect myself? The second one is a question i will never get an answer to. How will the human body process information in the case of natural disasters? Is human life worth saving in the case of a massive earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, etc? The point i want to make is that we live in a world with very real threats to every person alive. What really bothers me are the very real threats we have to face as individuals, nations, and on a larger scale as a civilization. If we do not change our way of thinking and how we interact with each other we will find ourselves facing such things from the next hurricane to the next meteor that the earth passes through. There is a fear that people have that the future is a very unknown and scary place and if anything happened (or is going to happen) to us, no one would be able to save us. To an extent, i agree with this. But there comes a point after which it no longer matters what someone says. If someone says something is possible, then it is possible. If something does happen to one of us who has a fear of the unknown, then it becomes a reality. The same goes for the human body. From cancer cells to a virus, cancer cells are the same. I have been in several situations that have made me feel as if i was the exception to the rules. I have watched people die due to lack of knowledge, and I have lost people due to lack of information. This makes the true fact of the statement above very undeniable. As long as we still need to protect ourselves from the natural disasters on the horizon, as long as we still need to help those who are in need, as long as we still have the need to care for the many more people who live under war with their own countries, then	0
Twelve suspected members of the Zetas drug gang and a member of Mexico's Navy were killed in a shootout on an island in a lake that straddles the  Zeta Cartel's smuggling route into the United States, the navy said.Nine marines and a woman were killed when the U.S. Marine Corps launched a strike Thursday on the island of San Jose del Cabo, just off the coastline of Mexican state of Baja California, the navy said.Cabo San Lucas, 30 miles from the Pacific Ocean, is a popular destination for those with vacation time. It is a popular vacation spot for Mexicans and foreigners alike, and for people who take their vacations with their families.Six members of the Mexican military and federal police died in a shootout with a drug gang in northern Mexico, officials said. One of the dead was an army officer.The cartel’s top leader, Osiel Cardenas Zavala, was killed in an operation that officials from his organization, as well as local communities, have publicly protested, according to a spokesman for Baja California state’s attorney general’s office.A suspected drug lord was killed by the Navy Monday as he tried to flee the scene of a shootout in Baja California state, Mexico.

Chris Hoy became Great Britain's most decorated Olympian of all time after his victory in the men's keirin took his tally to six gold medals. Hoy fought off a late charge from Germany's Maximilian Levy in the final  to win gold after leading from the start and the race was stopped in the last lap. However, the two-time world champion insisted he was not "over the moon" with his victory on the road to becoming the third rider in Olympic history to win silver in an individual event.After Hoy's victory in the individual event, Britain ended top of the medal table for the seventh time since 1968, and went on from then becoming the first country to take seven gold medals with Hoy joining the record-breaking of Thomas Bach and Carl Lewis as the only two Britons to achieve the feat.The silver medal followed Hoy's second gold medal in the omnium - a total of four in total after winning all three individual events in the 2008 Olympic Games - and his third medal overall in the team pursuit, after winning the gold on the track in Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008.On Friday, Hoy also added two silver medals to his career list. In the individual pursuit Hoy scored the first and only British victory in the event at Tokyo in 2008. He subsequently became the first British rider to win three individual pursuit titles in a row. He also became the first British rider to win medals in the individual pursuit and omnium at the same Olympics."I always felt I was a very good middle distance rider," Hoy said. "In 2008, I didn't even know if I could do it, but what I did achieve is incredible; not only for me but for everyone on this team."Team pursuit's individual winner, the Norwegian Elisabeth Gethins, finished second in the individual pursuit, with American Chris Mazdzer third.Mazdzer, the reigning Olympic champion in the men's omnium, had the worst of the opening laps after Hoy's attack on the final circuit of the course. The American then took the lead in the latter half and powered to a lead of over two minutes, only for Hoy to close the gap rapidly, and win the medal-deciding sprint.Hoy will be the Olympic games' most decorated rider, also winning gold in the men's team pursuit in Sydney a year earlier, and also earning the bronze medal in the men's omn	0
Even though he sailed to the White House on the wings of his soaring rhetoric, President Barack Obama could find that he is on mission impossible as he launches his media blitz on Syria this week Ã¢Â€Â“ a war zone where U.S. foreign policy stands on its head.

A Japanese coast guard crew member has confessed to leaking a video of a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan, officials said Wednesday. It was unclear whether the crew member would be arrested for putting the video online, police said. The video, posted on YouTube, shows what is thought to be the Chinese fishing trawler ramming into a ship, thought to be a Japanese coast guard vessel. The crash video had not been released to the public and Japanese lawmakers were alarmed that it had been on the video-sharing website. "The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government," Hiroshi Kawauchi, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, said last week. "It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government." The September incident sparked a diplomatic squabble between the two nations. After the collision, Japan detained the crew of the Chinese fishing boat off the disputed islands in the East China Sea. China calls the islands the Diaoyu; Japan calls them the Senkaku. In response to the detainments, China made increasingly aggressive diplomatic threats. Beijing also halted ministerial-level talks with Tokyo, and both sides canceled trips to each other's nations. Japan has since released the fishing crew, which China says was stopped illegally. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. But authorities later said that releasing him was in the interest of maintaining relations with China. Though the leaking of the video has alarmed Japanese officials, officials in China have questioned its accuracy. Some in the Chinese government dismissed the video saying it had been edited. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.	1
Things aren't looking good for people with allergies in Tennessee. Not only is the pollen apocalypse on its way, three of the state's major cities made the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's annual list of the 10 worst places for spring allergy sufferers. These so-called allergy capitals are ranked based on pollen levels, use of allergy medications and the number of board-certified allergists in the areas, according to a foundation statement. Everyone in the United States can expect their allergies to be worse this year, thanks to an unusually wet winter, the foundation says. "Severe weather patterns can bring higher temperatures, higher pollen levels and increased exposure to mold, resulting in spring allergies that can peak stronger and last longer," Dr. Bill Berger, a California allergist, said in the statement. Here are the top 10 worst allergy cities for 2013: 1. Jackson, Mississippi 2. Knoxville, Tennessee 3. Chattanooga, Tennessee 4. McAllen, Texas 5. Louisville, Kentucky 6. Wichita, Kansas 7. Dayton, Ohio 8. Memphis, Tennessee 9. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 10. Baton Rouge, Louisiana Residents in Springfield, Massachusetts; Buffalo, New York; and Grand Rapids, Michigan, may face more severe cases than they have in years past. These cities all jumped at least 10 spots up on the list from the spring of 2012. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation also releases a list every year of the worst cities for fall allergy sufferers. The spring allergy capitals are based on tree pollen counts, while the fall cities are ranked on ragweed pollen counts from September through November of the previous years. Many of the cities on the fall list are on the spring list, but there are a few differences. 1. Louisville, Kentucky 2. Wichita, Kansas 3. Knoxville, Tennessee 4. Jackson, Mississippi 5. McAllen, Texas 6. Dayton, Ohio 7. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 8. Memphis, Tennessee 9. Madison, Wisconsin 10. Baton Rouge, Louisiana	1
Depending whom you ask, Chad Russell and Charles Butkus' invention is either a step forward for the Internet -- or a death knell for free content. Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices Â­ or programs with which the ads are targeted, then shows them to the user, who can then decide whether to click on them or leave the site."It's not a new idea," says Kevin Marks, a researcher at the University of Washington who has followed the progress of digital advertising since its earliest days. "But I don't think we understand what's going to happen when you take the content and the ads out of the ad-supported world."By separating the ads from the content, and allowing users to decide whether to see the ads, AdTrap turns the Internet content-based model on its head, and introduces a new, and highly controversial, new twist to the long-term future of the Internet.The two men behind AdTrap -- Russell and Butkus -- have been battling over control of the technology for the last couple of years, with Butkus asserting his right to the design and technology. Russell has agreed to share the technology with Butkus, according to three people familiar with the matter, but not financially. As we've reported, the AdTrap technology has drawn the support of several digital advertising industry organizations, and even a group of major players that includes Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and the US Federal Trade Commission.The AdTrap device has been tested in Europe for months by major players in the digital advertising business: Telefonica, IBM, Microsoft, and others. It's also the subject of litigation in the US and Europe.In fact, the AdTrap system is the kind of tech that's been widely used for decades by large Internet companies. It's been used in Microsoft's Windows Media Player, for example, and has been used by AOL and many others to deliver online ads.But while it might not be new, AdTrap is novel. The AdTrap system is an open -- and, as of now, not very open, given that it still requires access to hardware on users' PCs and the use of AdTrap-branded software.AdTrap is not an Internet-specific product, and it is not a way to take control of what people can see on the Internet.

Tyler Sampson, a middle-schooler from Frisco, Texas, doesn't let his differences get in the way of his dream. Since his family's farm isn't quite big enough to accommodate a farmhouse, he has to commute by bus to school. At first that seemed like something he would never do—especially since he had once spent all day in school and he didn't like it. But then he realized that it only took a couple days of riding the bus to be able to save up enough money to buy one, and then he couldn't picture himself ever living in the city. At least not until he got to know his mother and his other siblings. He doesn't want to go back to the farm or the city. He wants to spend the rest of his life on a big farm with his family, eating what his mother makes. To get there, he plans to sell his video game console and buy a large farm with enough land to grow all of his vegetables. It looks like he's going to need more land.And that's where his life gets interesting. Sampson's parents have plans of their own to get married—a plan that has nothing to do with his actual desires. To Sampson's family this could be a huge deal because of how his older brother would be getting married. His older brother, who is much like Sampson in many ways, is going to marry his stepmother, an older woman who does not care for Sampson. It would be their first wedding and many more would follow.Sampson gets teased mercilessly by his friends, who constantly compare his life to their own. That's how it will ever remain an important part of his life, and what will make him happy.As he moves closer to his dream, however, his life becomes more complicated. His brother has chosen to reject both siblings and to marry his stepmother, who looks down on his family and believes that a farmer should never have a video game. Sampson is forced to find a way to get out of the situation, at least for a while.However, his life is not made any easier by the fact that he has no idea how to get out of this problem. Sampson, despite his problems, is an honorable person, someone who does want to build a life for himself. He just has to figure out how to do it.CharactersSamp	0
Five people have been killed after one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes spewed a giant cloud of ash and rocks early Tuesday. They were climbing on Mount Mayon, some 212 Ã¢ÂÂ 570 km (160 miles) southeast of Manila, the capital, when the eruptions began, according to the Philippine National Police.The eruption was captured by video by a tourist on the mountain, said the police spokesman, Senior Supt. Ramon Zagala.A member of the Philippine search and rescue team, in a helicopter that was sent to the volcano, said the team had found the bodies of two men in the volcanic crater, while a third, a woman, apparently had been pulled out of the crater by a rope.The three victims were in their 30s, Zagala said.The volcano is located in the Cordillera, an area of rugged mountains, glaciers, rivers and dense rainforests. It has long been active, producing small eruptions during the dry season that are often followed by floods.But in recent years, the eruptions have taken on greater frequency, some lasting several hours.Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, who vowed to wipe out the country's most active volcanoes in favor of more productive areas in the Philippines, has expressed anger over the deaths, calling them a "slaughter" in a Facebook posting.There were also reports that the volcano, on the last piece of land that was once the island of Luzon, had been evacuated as authorities attempted to contain the eruption, which was felt by much of the Asian archipelago.The eruption sent a plume of ash over hundreds of kilometers, with dense cloud appearing to cover the Philippines as far south as Singapore and as far north as northern Vietnam.The eruption spewed a cloud of ash and pumice, or volcanic rock, which created a large red-orange cloud high above the volcano in the Philippine capital, according to a Philippine weather agency.The eruption, which had a height of 4,500 meters (14,500 feet), created a red glow over the city of Manila, said the weather agency. It added that the plume of ash was a "coconut-shaped cloud which can easily be seen on a clear night."The Philippine military began sending in helicopters to evacuate thousands of island residents, from Tag	0
The Hillsborough County, Florida, sheriff on Wednesday offered a personal apology to a disabled man who was dumped onto the floor from his wheelchair while in deputies' custody. Brian Sterner has been using a wheelchair since a 1994 wrestling accident. "I am personally embarrassed and shocked by the horrific treatment Mr. Sterner received," Sheriff David Gee says in a statement on the department's Web site. A video now making the rounds on television networks and various Web sites shows a deputy tipping Brian Sterner, 32, out of a wheelchair at the county's booking center in Tampa on January 29. "I cannot and will not even try to offer an explanation for what is seen on the video, other than to say, that once it was brought to my attention, I immediately initiated an internal investigation," Gee said. Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said. "This deputy ... she looked at me, she didn't believe that I was a quadriplegic, I guess, and she walked behind me with those handles on the back of that hospital-grade wheelchair and she just dumped it straight forward," Sterner told Tampa television station WTSP.  Watch the incident on tape » As Sterner lay crumpled on the floor, two female deputies frisked him. "I told them how to pick me up and put me back in the chair, but without sensation -- I don't feel anything from my chest down -- so I didn't know they were broken then, my ribs," he added. John Trevena, Sterner's attorney, said the sheriff denied that his client's ribs were broken, saying that X-rays showed no fractures. Sterner spent five days in the jail's infirmary before being released on $2,000 bond, Trevena said. The deputy responsible for dumping Sterner from the chair has been suspended without pay, Gee said in his statement. The three supervisors who were on duty during the incident have also been suspended, but with pay, the sheriff's public information office told CNN. "The incident involving Mr. Sterner was not caused by a lack of training or procedure," the sheriff's statement said. "It represents aberrant behavior that is totally out of context with policies, practices and standards of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.	1
Iran's centrist president-elect expressed a willingness to open dialogue with the United States, which it hasn't had diplomatic relations with in decades, but only if the United States recognizes Iran's right to a nuclear program. Hassan  Mohamad Shirzai, who is considered centrist inside Iran, tweeted Wednesday that he will be "willing, but not enthusiastic" in a dialogue between the two nuclear powers.His statements on Twitter and on his website confirm Tehran's determination to negotiate a broad agreement with Washington without pre-conditions or giving in to American demands.Under an agreement with six major powers and a number of minor ones, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear activities, with six curbs not covered by the agreement. Among the curbs Iran agreed to lift are certain centrifuges that enrich uranium in order to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, and a number of other restrictions.Among the curbs Iran agreed to lift is a ban on the possession and production of the centrifuges used to make nuclear fuel.Iran also agreed to allow international inspectors to monitor the country's nuclear program, which includes a detailed inspection regime.But US President Barack Obama has proposed additional sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, which the White House says is a cover-up for its nuclear ambitions.Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced Monday that Iranian scientists had discovered a uranium process that could be used to make nuclear bombs but the Iranian government has yet to release the information.In his statement, Ahmadinejad said Iran had been developing its nuclear program for 35 years, and warned other countries of a "diplomatic and military confrontation" if they did not comply with the nuclear deal.Iran has been negotiating with the six major world powers that negotiated the framework of the nuclear deal with Tehran, including the United States, in a bid to convince them to waive restrictions placed on Iran on its nuclear program.Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Monday that Iranian scientists have discovered a uranium process that could be used to make nuclear bombs but the Iranian government has yet to release the information.In his statement, Ahmadinejad said Iran had been developing its nuclear program for 35 years, and warned other countries of a "diplomatic and military confrontation" if they did not comply with the nuclear deal.On Friday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran believed its nuclear work should be kept	0
Six weeks into the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public, taken from Hernandez's own home security system. Prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest Hernandez is holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez' Boston home. "In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol," Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testifies. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace, and Carlos Ortiz are seen on the same security video, recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013, after the men walk into Hernandez's home. All three have been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and have pleaded not guilty. Wallace and Ortiz are being tried separately. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by Hernandez. Jurors lean forward in their chairs, peering into monitors and scribbling notes as Aspinwall, a former Massachusetts state trooper and New Hampshire police chief, takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony. Aspinwall tells jurors Hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he's standing at his basement door. The defense will have none of it. They attack Aspinwall's credentials. Aspinwall is well-schooled in Glocks but admits he doesn't consider himself a gun identification expert. Hernandez's lawyers then show a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. "Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?" defense attorney James Sultan asks. "No, they do not," Aspinwall answers. Sultan then displays a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Prosecutors dispute the suggestion.	1
Ibrahim Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Azeem is one of the last traditional craftsmen in Egypt making the oud, the guitar-like instrument heard in so much Arabic music. He is one of only six or seven oud makers still working in the historic Mohamed Ali Street in Cairo. It takes him a week to make one oud for sale, molding it from thin layers of wood that are joined together without using nails. "We bring big chunks of wood and then we cut it into thin layers," said Abdel-Azeem. "First we put those layers on the hot iron. Later we bend it. When it comes out we glue it together because the Oud doesn't not have any nails." Abdel-Azeem, 62, inherited his art from his father and started out in his workshop while he was still at school. "The profession is originally Egyptian and moved to Syria and Turkey, but my father brought it back to Egypt," said Abdel-Azeem. Abdel-Azeem was only 14 when his father died and he took over his workshop. It is not just a job to him, but a way of life. "Oud is the Sultan of music and songs," said Abdel-Azeem. "Without oud there's no music. It's the base to any other instrument. "Making an oud requires artistic talent. It's not only a trade because when the oud is not made properly or the sound coming out of it is not right we become emotionally depressed." See also: Egyptian student sends spiders in to space But he worries that the trade will die out. "The only people left making ouds are only six or seven people in the country. No one is interested in learning it anymore. "If it continues this way this profession will die. Other instruments took over. We used to take oud classes in school. They don't teach oud anymore except in colleges of music." Another man working hard to keep the tradition of the oud alive is Naseer Shamma, one of the most famous musicians in the Middle East. Shamma, 47, is a composer, performer, poet and now a teacher. He left his native Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule and moved to Cairo where he now runs a "House of Oud" music school with branches in Egypt, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates.	1
The most esteemed guardian of the English language has bestowed a prestigious honor upon debatably the most embarrassing phenomenon of the digital age: the selfie. So, grab a smartphone, put on your best duck face and celebrate. Oxford Dictionaries' word for the year for 2013 is "selfie." And when you share that filtered photo on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, you'll join not just Anthony Weiner and Geraldo, but millions of others around the world perpetuating a tradition started over a decade ago, Oxford says. The word "selfie" first popped up in an Australian chat room on September 13, 2002,  to describe an undignified scene, the dictionaries' publishers believe. Related: Young drivers snap selfies behind wheel This was the post: "Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie." Yes, the first-ever known mention of the word "selfie" stemmed from an inebriated mouth with teeth protruding through its bottom lip. Given those circumstances, Oxford may not much care how you spell it. You could go with "ie" or "y," as in "selfy." Oxford says that doesn't change the official definition: "A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website." Complete unknown For years after its birth, "selfie" crept through the web largely unnoticed. But in 2012, the word of the year began its ascent to digital fame, Oxford says. Suddenly, everybody around the world was using the word, as they self-snapped away. Related: 'Selfies at funerals' must die By August this year, Oxford proclaimed it a real English-language word and gave it a place in the dictionary -- but that was merely a stepping stone to lingual infamy. "Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year," Oxford wrote in justifying its choice. "Selfie" beat out seven competitors, including "twerk," "schmeat" (synthetically produced meat) and "bitcoin" for the Word of the Year crown.	1
An agreement reached Sunday in South Africa will help tackle the challenges of climate change for years to come, the United Nations' chief said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the decision reached by parties of the Climate Change Convention in Durban, South Africa, which agreed to extend efforts set forth in the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, ratified by 37 industrialized countries, was set to expire in 2012. It mandates that industrialized nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Ban "welcomes the agreement to establish a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol that will increase certainty for the carbon market and provides additional incentives for new investments in technology and the infrastructure necessary to fight climate change," according to a statement from his office. As part of a broad pact, nations will agree in some sort of a legal format to curb their carbon emissions. The talks also launched the Green Climate Fund, which would essentially channel about $100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change. U.S. chief negotiator Todd Stern described the talks as "tough" but worthwhile. "For the first time there is an agreement to negotiate a legal accord of some sort, a legal instrument that is applicable to all countries -- that is a new thing. That means China, India and Brazil -- and there is no hedging in it," Stern said. He added, "We have been pushing for the last three years continually to change the paradigm of this negotiation so it did apply to all the big emitters because you can't solve this problem if you have 50-60% of world emissions not at the table. So an agreement to do this legal accord --that's applicable to of all the major parties, that's a big deal." The British secretary for energy and climate change also said he was pleased. "I think we have all come away from this now with a really credible package which will address the problems of global warming," Chris Huhne said. The agreement came after a marathon session of negotiations. "It was an extraordinarily complex negotiation with a lot of moving parts," said Elliot Diringer, an executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions who was an adviser to former U.S. President Bill Clinton.	1
A Chinese court has sentenced a man to three and a half years in prison for running over a 2-year-old girl and leaving her bleeding in the street, state media reported, a case that stirred debate in China about the level of compassion of its citizens. The Nanhai District People's Court in the city of Foshan, Guangdong Province, convicted Hu Jun of manslaughter on Wednesday for the death of the girl, Wang Yue, who was hit and crushed by Hu's minibus and another vehicle in October, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The girl, nicknamed Yueyue, had wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store in Foshan when she was run over. She subsequently died of her injuries after both vehicles drove away from the scene and more than a dozen people passed by without stopping to help. Yueyue laid motionless in the street in a busy market area for 10 minutes until Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. She moved Yueyue to safety and called for help. A video of the events from a security camera was posted online, provoking sympathy, outrage and debate both inside and outside China. Many wondered aloud how so many people could pass by the critically injured child and do nothing. The case prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morals and civic-mindedness, as some people questioned whether years of strong economic growth had made people more interested in personal gain than the welfare of others. Other people blamed a lack of laws and regulations or a failure of China's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity. At the trial in Foshan, Hu confessed to running Yueyue over, Xinhua reported, but argued that he should be convicted of traffic offenses rather than manslaughter. The court said it had given him a lenient sentence because he had given himself up to the police and paid some of Yueyue's medical fees, according to Xinhua. But most Chinese people reacting to the court's decision on social media appeared to believe Hu had not been punished severely enough. "Just 3 years and 6 months to compensate for a life?" the user ShuiQiangLeWoDeChenTuFeiYang posted on a microblog.	1
Inspectors overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons have visited 21 of the 23 sites they want to inspect by a Friday deadline, but security concerns have prevented visits to the remaining two, the world's chemical weapons watchdog said Monday. "Efforts have been mounted to schedule all the sites for inspection," the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement as the deadline drew closer. Earlier, Syria said it will not agree to visits by international inspectors looking for chemical weapons after Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution in favor of the action. "We will not agree to any inspection by the United Nations as long as the resolution is not in our interests," Bashar al-Assad told Russia's foreign ministry on Monday.A: Not agreeing to it.Q: So there are many ways of doing this?A: No, there is one way, the use of force, which is different from how we have used force in the past. This time the use of force is being used to avoid a political solution from occurring.Q: You know the world is watching right?A: They are watching the situation. And there is an international community watching. The international community wants to see the destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons program. And we're not going to allow that situation to occur.A: We will destroy Syria's chemical weapons, we will end the threat of chemical weapons, and we will ensure that Syria has the capacity to maintain the peaceful settlement of its relations with its neighbors and world community.A: And at the same time, we will ensure that we live in peace and we live in security and freedom. And I'm confident of the future of my country and the future of my children and the future of my grandchildren.A: And while every single one of us understands that the world must be protected under the highest possible standard of respect for human rights and international law, there is no doubt that the world also must respond to the threat of such weapons. The world must see that chemical weapons are eliminated in a way that doesn't threaten the world's security and that in the future allows for peace and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect between states.We all understand the need for the destruction of chemical weapons. We expect the Security Council to come up with a resolution on this that meets our expectations.Q: So what we have	0
Like a stereotypical beauty pageant, it looks like thin will be in at the world's largest annual gadget convention next week in Las Vegas. At the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show, computer makers will be pushing a ersatz new iphone, an unimpressive tablet, and a slick new iPad, all in a race to attract first-time buyer buyers by the hundreds of thousands, and by the millions who have no interest in iphones.A big part of these efforts will be to push out big-screened, iphone-like tablets to consumers the world over. After failing to sell new iphones in the U.S., Apple turned to tablets for a way to break into the larger market in less than a year's time. Now HP and Dell are trying to do something similar, in China.Here's the real deal: No matter how good or innovative the tablet, its performance -- at least in our experience -- is going to be slower than an iphone in a real-world scenario if you're watching video on it, or typing with it, or using it as a Web browser. The difference between a slow iPad and a slow iPhone is the difference between a $1,200 phone and a $1,500 phone. The screen size is small enough to be useful as a phone, but not as a tablet.You can see this in action on the new Surface with Windows RT, which is based on a 1.86-inch screen -- and will apparently sell for the same as an older model with a 4-inch screen, since it runs Windows RT. But you don't get a keyboard or real handwriting recognition. That's the trade-off, and it may make the Surface a good buy for some people. But we have a deep skepticism about the use of Surface's full-screen Windows RT (which is not an actual version of Windows; it's a desktop operating system designed to give you access to a full-screen windowed program or Web page with full-screen images or just Web browser, not a full, touch-sensitive touchpad computer). The Surface runs the iPad's full-screen Web browser and Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and works fine in most circumstances. But in our real-world experiences, the Surface just isn't nearly as fast as a real iPad -- and we've had it on all day long.At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las	0
The Supreme Court concluded a marathon public debate on health care Wednesday with justices signaling an ideological divide that could topple some or all of the the sweeping reform bill championed by President Barack Obama. On the third day of oral arguments on legal challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the justices tackled the question of what would happen if they ruled that the heart of the law, the individual mandate that is its key funding mechanism, was unconstitutional. The six hours of hearings over three days provided an extended public view of the high court in action on one of the most controversial issues of the day, touching on legal concepts involving federal and state powers, individual rights and legislative intent. High court listens to arguments on Medicaid expansion At stake is the survival of the signature legislation of Obama's presidency as he seeks re-election in November: the health care reform law that requires most  Americans to have health coverage as part of a systemic overhaul intended to lower  costs. The justices looked at procedural issues Monday and then tackled the heart of the law Tuesday, the constitutionality of the individual mandate that requires people to get health coverage or pay a fine. High court divided over health care mandate At issue Wednesday morning was whether all the law's 450 or so provisions would have to be scrapped if the individual mandate were found unconstitutional. A separate session Wednesday afternoon looked at whether states would be "coerced" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration by the risk of losing federal funding if they refuse. To CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, the questioning by justices Wednesday signaled they are ready to invalidate the individual mandate, a step he said could put the entire law in jeopardy. "I think the individual mandate is gone, based on the questioning," Toobin said after the morning session.  "It sure looks like there are at least five votes to get rid of ... the individual mandate." Listen to oral arguments in the historic case White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Obama administration remained confident its signature health care law is constitutional. Anyone who tries to predict the outcome of the case based on the questions justices asked during this week's arguments "is not a very good student of the Supreme Court," Earnest told reporters, adding that Justice Department lawyers faced similar tough questions from conservative judges in lower courts that later upheld the law "in at least a couple of these cases."	1
South Korea's prime minister has offered to resign for a second time, the prime minister's office said Thursday, after failure to get a deal with opposition parties on next year's national election. Lee Myung-bak, who has been prime minister and leader of the conservative party since 1998, said he would quit at the end of May because he had been unable to get any of the 16 opposition parties to join his government. The offer is the first sign of discontent in a country that is regarded as the center of world politics on two fronts - the United States and the Democratic Republic of Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has said it will not join with the U.S. or pressure the South, saying it would not accept what it sees as a victorious communist state. In addition, South Korea has been under an economic freeze imposed by the U.S. since 1995 until next year's election and has already had two years to get its economy back on track. The economy is forecast to grow around 3 percent this year and next. The president, Lee Myung-bak, has been in office since 1998 but is due to step down in May. Analysts say he could have faced impeachment charges over what they say is a failure to keep the economy in balance. Lee said he did not want to make hasty decisions after being elected as prime minister in 1998 but that he had wanted to keep his government on a course forward. "When I was elected I said I would do whatever I could, regardless of what happened in other parties or other factors," he said. "It's my responsibility not only to give my word but to also make a pledge to you." The two-term premier was born in 1946 to a poor peasant farmer in South Korea's northeast, and studied law at South Korea's top law school, Seoul University. The son of a party member and a teacher, he won a seat in parliament in 1983 after winning a by-election for a post in the ministry of justice. He served as prime minister of South Korea from 1993 to 1996 when the nation was under military rule and the first	0
The American Civil Liberties Union has called on officials in Massachusetts and Florida to conduct independent investigations into the shooting death of a man by an FBI agent. Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot early May 22 during  a traffic stop, a fatal mistaken identity. As the FBI's investigation is still underway, the ACLU sent a letter to Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, calling for a review of how the incident was handled by law enforcement, and on the need for independent investigations whenever a fatal police shooting occurs — one which could be a wake-up call for the agency's training and tactics.The ACLU's letter says:The death of Mr. Todashev, and the shooting by the FBI of another man who was killed by the same FBI agent earlier that same month, demonstrates the disturbing realities that come with having a policy that allows the FBI to operate without sufficient oversight, including the use of live ammunition during routine traffic stops. We believe that these shooting incidents are underinvestigated and require independent investigation by law enforcement agencies.The letter says that "the FBI routinely engages in dangerous practices, as when it deployed an informant or undercover agent near the site where the shooting occurred".It also says the actions of the agent in Florida are similar to the use of the same informant to kill Walter Scott in North Charleston back in February 2008, before he was shot in the back and ran from the scene."In both of these cases, the use of police informants to conduct surveillance and gather information about suspects in an undercover capacity violates the Fourth Amendment and the U.S. Constitution, rendering the surveillance illegal. The FBI can no longer use such surveillance without violating the rights of citizens and without having adequately investigated the circumstances surrounding the use of informants or undercover agents, the conduct of the informants, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting itself."However, the ACLU says in its letter that the FBI should have "adequately investigated the circumstances surrounding the use of informants to conduct surveillance, and the conduct of the informants. As required, law enforcement should have thoroughly reviewed all information gathered through surveillance, and taken action to preserve the integrity of that information."And the letter says:The FBI should also revisit its policy regarding the use of armed, undercover law enforcement in traffic stops to gather information about drivers and passengers, including information about drivers’ and passengers’ past activities.

A federal law requiring that screening machines commonly found at schools, courthouses and other public facilities be able to detect all types of firearms will expire in less than a month. And that Â means that people who already have access to such a device will still have unrestricted access to more firearms, as the law requires these types of machines to be able to detect all types of firearms. The machines, known as the NICS, or National Instant Criminal Background Checks, are used to weed out people who may be allowed to buy guns.The requirement that the law be extended expired at the end of January. But the law is not automatically repealed. Instead, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with determining whether to extend the law again.The House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the subject this week, and a number of industry experts testified that the law could be extended again. But the DHS and NRA have said they will not renew the law and that it should be repealed. The law will probably have to be repealed if the next Congress is to extend it again.This is not the first time Congress has extended NICS laws. The first time was in 1993 when Congress overrode President Clinton's veto but that was because of a loophole in the law. The loophole allowed anyone who had gone to court to obtain a judicial order to buy a gun if an NICS check came back negative. This was not the first time that NICS checks had been found to have failed to detect past felons, but Congress just did not want to take any action to fix the problem, and it is no longer an issue because of the loophole in the law that allowed them to be granted access to guns in the first place.The loophole was closed in 1997 when the ban on assault weapons was adopted and that's why the NICS law has been renewed every year since. But this year's renewal will be problematic.The gun market is so inundated with all of this "freedom" these days that people really do not need the ability to get a gun without going through the same process that everyone else has to go through. And the fact remains that anyone who passed a background check has done everything they needed to pass the background check. They just had the right to carry a gun in their local courthouse or community center without going through the process.So what we are left with is a law that is	0
Rooting for the Seahawks or rooting for the Broncos in the Super Bowl? Heck, we were rooting for Bruno Mars. The Grammy-winning artist had a tough act to follow this year with his halftime show, given that last year's iced-tea jam was the best thing he'd done in recent memory.By the time Sunday's show rolled around, people were watching Mars' halftime performance not as a cultural phenomenon, but as a harbinger of hope for the year ahead. "There was a very heavy feeling," Mars told us at the Grammys earlier this week. "The feeling was, the Super Bowl has been the most watched football game in history. We're just going to turn it into a concert. And I knew what was happening the whole time because I was telling the kids how it was playing out. It had been three years of us playing in Vegas. The fans have been there through the ups and downs and the disappointments, and they had been there through everything, and that's what we were seeing when the game kicked off, and I was just smiling from ear to ear when I saw it. We played the whole night as a celebration, a party, and I was just smiling like, this is going to be fantastic. It will be a huge thing."You would hope that Mars is still smiling as the Super Bowl is taking place Sunday evening. Mars, who is a member of the Washington Redskins, is one of the hosts of the game, along with the Broncos quarterback, Trevor Siemian. As one of his co-hosts, Siemian is also a member of the NFL's 50 Greatest Players of the 20th Century. Last year he was named one of eight recipients of the game's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. But the reason his name was on that list was because of his performance on halftime with Mars.Siemian, who has been a part of several big moments in his life, said the Super Bowl would be nothing but a great way to end the year. "This has been such a great year for me, and this is just a good way to cap it off," he said. "It's always good to play this game, and to play with my buddy Bruno Mars. I'm just really happy for him. It was a great time for all of us. It's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun to go out there, and it's	0
Cold air swinging south from Canada left residents from North Dakota to New York contending with severe weather that proved deadly in some areas. "Those people who work outside have to be careful," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Wednesday. Authorities say exposure to sub-freezing temperatures left at least three people dead in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. The coldest air so far is in northwestern Quebec, where temperatures plummeted to 45 degrees below zero Fahrenheit in the city of Rouyn, according to forecasters. "We feel the wind chill, and so do pets. You need to find some place indoors and out of the wind for them," Myers said. In the northern Maine town of Presque Isle, temperatures hung around 24 below. And in Grand Forks, North Dakota, residents bundled up to stave off a potentially deadly wind chill that hovered even lower -- around 33 below. "The biggest thing is staying out of the wind. That's what kills you," said Michael Lannen, who works at a Menards hardware store in Grand Forks. "It seems we get one of these kinds of weeks every year, so everyone is just trying to bundle up and stay indoors." Share your cold weather stories, videos and images iReport: Cold Wisconsin! In Ohio, the State Highway Patrol closed Interstate 90 in Lake County near Cleveland after white-out conditions contributed to accidents in the area. Forecasters also predicted possible ice accumulations Thursday into Friday, leaving areas as far south as Georgia under a winter weather watch. CNN iReporters sought to demonstrate the effects of the weather by tossing boiling water into the air and watching as the mist particles froze midair. In New York and New Jersey, homes destroyed by Superstorm Sandy in places such as New Dorp, Staten Island, and Far Rockaway, Queens, still lack basic utilities needed to restore heat. But the cold weather may have been good news for those who sell hot coffee. "On days like this, coffee sells. Bagels don't," said Sami Akramia, a 41-year-old food cart worker bundled up in Midtown Manhattan as the temperature dropped to 4 degrees. National Weather Service forecasters say they expect the cold weather to last throughout the week. Environmentalists hope for action from Obama	1
When Frederick Hutson left prison in 2012 after serving four years on marijuana-related charges, he realized he had gained something more than his freedom: insight into an overlooked consumer market. Many inmates are stuck in an age before Instagram or Facebook, relying on envelopes and pay phones to connect with family on the outside. So Hutson founded Pigeonly, a photo-sharing and low-cost phone call service that has already helped 50,000 incarcerated individuals connect with their loved ones, maintain their ties to society, and remain a presence in their children's lives. The story of Pigeonly is statistically unlikely: a disruptive technology created by a member of a disenfranchised community, in order to solve a problem within that community. It is also a model for the type of entrepreneurship that can revive American capitalism: both inclusive of and responsive to America's changing demographics. One of the great achievements of the civil rights and women's rights movements was that they unleashed an enormous pool of talent into the economic life of America. Desegregation and the women's movement broke down barriers to education and employment and made our nation stronger by making it more competitive. Yet 50 years later, a narrow vision of capitalism once again threatens to leave many Americans behind. Our nation's failure to achieve equal educational opportunity has exacerbated race-based economic disparities and produced two starkly different American economies. And while women have made strong gains in professional life, they remain dramatically underrepresented in many of the most profitable sectors. Silicon Valley is hardly the only place where this is evident, but addressing it here is crucial to turning the tide. Last year there were eight states where zero Latino students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science, and 11 states in which no black students took the test. In three states, not a single female student sat for the exam. It is no surprise, then, that 99% of venture capital-funded startups in 2010 were founded by whites or people of Asian descent, the vast majority of whom were men. The result of this pipeline problem is an enormous amount of untapped talent and a tech sector that fails to reflect the demographics of its users. To be sure, government can play a crucial role in leveling the playing field. But it can only go so far. The leaders of the innovation economy can and should play their part in reviving capitalism by making it more responsive to a changing country's full range of widespread needs and more inclusive in the process.	1
In 2010 alone, there were roughly 1,100 attacks on U.S. fuel convoys. This has cost the men and women of our armed forces dearly. Military officials recently reported  that more than 3,000 uniformed soldiers and contractors died while  supporting the invasion of Iraq. The U.S. Army estimates that the cost of that war, including the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan, amounts to more than $1 trillion (U.S.). Of course, none of these costs are calculated on the basis of what would happen if those wars were to continue and are instead based solely on their economic and military impact.There is a growing feeling in our society—fueled by fear-mongering by the opposition, by their willingness to accept war if it means they can win, and by the false promises that are made to our soldiers—that the only way to stop the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is to have a large number of U.S. troops deployed in those locations. Some even call for the military to be stationed permanently in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we know that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan can go on for years. They require significant amounts of money and are expensive in both human and material terms. And U.S. soldiers do deploy in an expanded role in Iraq and Afghanistan. But with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan coming to an end this fall, the military need not have any sizable presence in either country if they want to accomplish their mission.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost our country $3.4 trillion—and, in terms of total casualties, at least as much as the Vietnam War. The cost of the Iraq War (and by extension, of the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan) is the equivalent of taking all of the veterans of the Vietnam War, the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, the first Gulf War, and the Second Gulf War and putting them all through our military draft system. The Vietnam War, in some measure, was the war on terror, in that it was used to take a nation—Vietnam—and turn it into a place where the world would view the U.S. as being an enemy and the U.S. military as a hostile force. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the wars on terror in that they have been used as a strategy to remove a nation and turn it into what the current U.S. president described as one of the most "	0
Months after accepting asylum in Russia, fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden on Thursday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices. "Does Russia intercept, store or analyze in any way the communications of _____________?" he wrote, along with his national identity number.Snowden said he would like to speak to Putin on a more personal level.

A stampede at a hilltop temple in western India killed more than 147 people and wounded 55 others who had gathered to celebrate the start of a religious holiday on Tuesday, police said. Victims of the stampede Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whose cause was initially attributed to a wedding or a partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ranged from seven to 104, police Inspector General Praveen Puthliya said.Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a stampede,Ã¢â‚¬Â he told the Times of India. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There were people sitting on the ground, a few lying on the ground. We cannot say there was a wedding or a party.Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ‚ÂPolice have yet to identify the people responsible, Puthliya said.

A Texas legislative committee approved a measure Thursday that would place broad new restrictions on abortions in the state, paving the way for the contentious legislation to become law. House Bill 2 cleared the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on a 6-3 vote. The bill will move to the full Senate floor Friday afternoon in the second attempt to pass the legislation in the Senate. The bill originally failed to pass during the previous special session because of a filibuster from Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator and presidential candidate, joined Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Republican members of the Texas House and Senate on Thursday to voice support for the bill and disdain for Davis and those who would seek to block the legislation. At a news conference, he blamed the media for lionizing Davis and accused the senator of being out of the American mainstream. "Look at what she was defending. She was saying that women shouldn't have sanitary conditions when receiving an abortion, she was defending that children who would otherwise be born alive shouldn't have the right to be born alive." He went on to say, "This is an important moment for everyone to recognize where the abortion debate really is in America." For Santorum and other stalwarts of the anti-abortion movement, what's happening in Texas will reverberate around the country. The measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas -- denying access to many in rural communities -- and force women to seek dangerous back-alley abortions. The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn't about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women's health. For them, it is about preventing situations like what occurred at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia, in a case in which Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to life with no parole for killing babies. However, Pastor Rick Scarborough, of Vision America, who was asked to provide opening remarks for the news conference, offered a much more succinct end goal: "This is a small, important step toward the beginning of the end of abortion in America."	1
After years of trying to put the past behind it, Brazil has created a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during a painful period in history known as the dirty war. Hundreds of people disappeared or were killed  from 1968 to 1978 over ideological differences between leftist rebels and right-wing groups. In the process, some 30,000 people were tortured or killed, according to official statistics. Here's what happened — and the new truth commission in action.Brazil has a new truth commissionAt the end of January, Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, announced plans to create a truth and reconciliation commission. In addition to investigating past crimes, it will focus on how the country dealt with the disappeared during the Dirty War.The commission, led by retired Justice Minister Helder Barbalho, has several objectives. It wants to build a strong institutional memory of the past with testimony from survivors and former prisoners of war. It wants to make sure that history is accurately and impartially recounted. And it wants to ensure that those responsible for the crimes are held accountable.But while the committee's efforts are laudable and important, they're not much more than a start. It will not be able to conduct more than an initial review — or, as president Rousseff puts it, "a little research ... then we will have to go to the next step, which is a process of dialogue with the families."The first step, as it often is with truth commissions, involves establishing the scope of the problem. Brazil, with its diverse population and vast geography, will have to look very hard at what happened between April 1968, when the Dirty War began, and April 1978, when President Fernando Collor de Mello took office.Then, the group will be required to interview around 150 survivors and victims of political and religious repression, and perhaps 50,000 other people. Their testimony alone could fill several volumes of the official history of South America's now-most-wanted regime.The next step is building a case and producing a public report by early 2010.This commission is not a full-scale study of the history of the dictatorship. It is, instead, a starting point. It is a step in the right direction.For the past two months, I have been meeting with Helder Barbalho, chief justice of Brazil's Supreme Court, and I have consulted extensively with two of the other	0
The love of money may be the root of all evil according to the Bible, but that hasn't stopped bookmakers from offering odds on who will emerge from the white smoke as the next pope. At odds as low as 2-1, Cardinal  Francis Bevilacqua is being bet by bookmakers on who will be next in line for papal succession.The Pope Benedict XVI, who died in 2013 at the age of 80, was elected by the College of Cardinals and the conclave of Italian Cardinals in 2013, an extraordinary event that was witnessed by thousands of people, most notably by US President Barack Obama's wife Michelle.Here are some of the most notable bets in Europe, as well as a few oddities and amusing comments on the event:Oddities1. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI's private secretary in the summer of 2007. During the papacy, he helped draft much of the liberal document Amoris Laetitia released later that year. But the controversial document has been attacked and questioned ever since its release by Pope Benedict's critics, who claim the document, which advocates traditional teachings for church teaching, is out of step with the teachings of the Church.Cardinal Ratzinger was born in Germany in 1922. He entered the Jesuit order at age 12 in Cologne, Germany, where he studied philosophy and theology and joined the faculty at the University of Cologne. Ratzinger was ordained a priest in 1952 and served as an archbishop and cardinal from 1974 to 2005.2. The election was televised on live television in Italy with a live audience, despite the election taking place in a small mountain village known as S. Maria in Trastevere, the first time a Pope has ever been elected from the country.3. Pope Francis is wearing two crosses on his soutane. The pope is usually seen wearing a white soutane.4. Before the papacy began, Pope Benedict XVI took the name Carlo Maria Viganò in honor of Carlo Maria Viganò, a young Roman Catholic who was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Milan, Italy, and whose family became victims of the Second World War when Carlo's father was killed in combat. Viganò's family was interned and then ultimately murdered by the Nazis. His death inspired writer William Faulkner to write the novel The Sound and the Fury	0
The Republican Senate primary in Mississippi had long been in the spotlight over nasty politics, but events just prior, during and now after the vote have placed the race in its own unusual category. Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel (D) both faced allegations of harassment.McDaniel became national news after a former staff member of his alleged that he made unwanted sexual advances and that she was fired for complaining about them. She subsequently said in an interview with ABC News that he sent her pornographic images and videos while she was working for him. The former staffer said she was sexually assaulted by him, according to an Associated Press report. McDaniel denied the allegations, released a written statement and said that he does not remember making any sexual advances while she was working for him.The allegations, McDaniel said, led to a campaign to recall him from office and possibly prevent his run for the U.S. Senate in the June 5 primary. McDaniel said he will run for the seat as a write-in candidate instead of seeking to win the primary, which is less favorable for those who do not have enough name recognition to get on the ballot.Cochran, meanwhile, faced allegations that he abused his position as chairman of the state Senate and also had misused taxpayer dollars. He said he was making progress with state ethics rules and would continue to do so.The allegations of sexual advances and misuse of funds, however, have cast a shadow on the race.The attacks and the controversy surrounding them drew attention to the race. The primary election is set for June 5.Cochran’s campaign responded to the allegations, saying that he had been the subject of a criminal investigation in 1998 for taking $50,000 in campaign money from a friend with business before the state legislature.McDaniel’s campaign issued a written denial of “any sexual conduct or misconduct that has occurred between me and my former staff.” He also said he would run as a write-in candidate.The Cochran campaign issued a statement from Cochran’s former chief of staff, Greg Dyer, who said the “allegations were brought to light by [McDaniel’s] campaign of unethical behavior that tarnished the image of the entire Mississippi Senate.”The McDaniel campaign issued a statement saying McDaniel “has always had a	0
Quick question: Who is the world's third biggest smartphone maker? BlackBerry? Guess again. HTC? Nope. It's Huawei. Yes, it's a paltry 5% of the global market, but the Chinese company that made its name selling telecom equipment  smartphones in China is now entering the Western market, with a slick new smartphone from the company's in-house hardware unit, called MWC.Huawei's top of the line phones come with its own version of Android, the so called HSDPA network. And as with other Android phones, the phone comes with a slew of applications, including Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Maps, and even some games. The application selection is also better than many Android phones out there, with a choice of Web, image, video, and music applications.There is another important difference between the new 5G version of Android and the last version of Android on the market. Android 4.4 is the current version for all current smartphones. This means that many other manufacturers could start developing phones based on Android 4.4.Huawei also plans to release its own version of iOS, called FlymeOS. The goal is to offer an alternative to the Apple-centric iPhone to help keep the high-end of the Chinese market. The release of the new OS will take place first in China this year, and it will open up the Chinese smartphone market to a bunch of new players.There is also a new version of the company's popular mobile messaging service, called Viber. It is available for both Android phones and iPhones, which runs natively on iOS. The messaging service lets users send messages to their Facebook friends, send text messages to contacts using their phones, and make phone calls from their phones using the Viber application. It's not clear when exactly Viber would be available for Android users.A number of Huawei devices come with an "HTC certified" seal of quality, which is the first mark of Apple's iPhone. In theory, this means that HTC has been working on this device for a long time.Now you can look into the camera app on your Huawei device, find your favorite photos and videos, and see what everyone else has shot. This is one of the many great little additions made by Huawei in the last few years.And the way to make the device stand out in its class is to run its own app "	0

We said they should come to India and be given weapons. We told them that we will protect them and we will give them the weapons. The LTTE knows full well that we were not responsible for the fighting in the past. We told the LTTE they are still our enemy, we'll still take responsibility for the security in the area, we'll still protect them so they can live in peace," he told PTI.

The man who says he was behind the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax claims he was in love with the Notre Dame linebacker, but the athlete knew nothing about the ruse. "He had no idea," said Â Manti Te'o's father. "She came to him, and he thought she was a nurse. She was very nice. But I don't understand why she didn't know about the story. It doesn't make sense."ÂThe Manti Te'o hoax began in 2011 when the sophomore wide receiver went to Notre Dame for spring football. Te'o was a four-star recruit who had spent the past two years at high school in South Padre Island, Texas after graduating from Stephen F. Austin in 2009.T'eo's interest in Notre Dame stemmed from the school's football program, which he attended. "I would have been happy with going," Te'o said in an interview with ESPN, "but Notre Dame has a very good football team."As the spring semester began, Te'o, then a junior, was a member of the varsity football team as the team's No. 3 wide receiver.Then at the end of the first game of the season against Stanford, Te'o's father called his son into the team's locker room for a private meeting. "I told him to be honest about his feelings," Te'o's father said.The student athlete was taken aback by the news, Te'o said. He was then asked to leave the team immediately.His mother called her son and told him the news. "He was shocked," Te'o's father said. "He wasn't going to school anymore. He was just a football player on Notre Dame football's springboard. I told him the story would get back to me." Te'o's mother says that was the last time she spoke to her son and that he "gave her the news that he was gay."For the next two years, Te'o played football for Notre Dame and lived with the team's trainers while recovering from multiple surgeries. "We didn't know where he was living," his father said. "He would come around on Saturdays. We had no idea his teammates knew he was gay. We were trying to figure this out."Manti Te'o, right, was in love with Notre Dame linebacker Manti	0
To control costs and increase flexibility, more and more U.S. mobile users are choosing no-contract plans (month-to-month or prepaid) for cell phone service. How happy are consumers with no-contract phones and service? J.D. Power and  L.C. Perkins surveyed mobile users about their satisfaction, cost, and performance.According to their survey, the vast majority of users are happy with their selection of a no-contract plan. The new pay-as-you-go service and low monthly bill (or fee) make up the largest share of satisfaction. Just 8% of respondents weren’t satisfied with their no-contract plan.What’s more, the survey shows that when consumers choose a no-contract phone service, they find the most success in the areas of cost and customer service. Only 1 in 10 respondents said they had dropped a contract before and then went back to the no-contract service. However, of those who had dropped a contract, the average number of months had them reverting back to a no-contract plan was 14.These users are willing to sacrifice on overall service and the price to get a no-contract plan. When asked which phone service providers were best for them based on overall customer satisfaction, respondents were very likely to name T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, and Sprint. The study also found that satisfaction with the service, call quality, and cost of service significantly increased as users were added to the no-contract plan.What do you think? Has the no-contract phone selection been a success for you? Or, has the price premium deterred you from choosing this option?J.D. Power and L.C. Perkins, a leading global provider of information and analytics, today announced that it will be offering consumers the opportunity to enroll in an enhanced version of its J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) program. Customers will now be able to access “Enhanced J.D. Power” CSI, which includes new and updated data on J.D. Power’s most current consumer satisfaction scores as well as new survey questions. Consumers will also now have the option to participate in Enhanced J.D. Power’s survey panel, which includes more than 4,500 nationwide phone and Internet customers who are representative of the U.S. public on key demographics, attitudes, and behaviors.	0
Undocumented immigrant students in California will be able to receive state-funded financial aid in 2013 to attend college, under a new law signed Saturday by Gov. Jerry Brown. The law allows top students who are on a path to citizenship to apply and receive the state aid, the governor said. About 2,500 students are projected to receive Cal Grants totaling $14.5 million, according to the California Department of Finance. That averages out to $5,800 per student. The funding amounts to 1% of the overall $1.4 billion Cal Grant program, officials said. The new law, AB 131, is one of two pieces of legislation known as the California Dream Act and will become effective January 1, 2013, officials said. "Going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking," Brown said in a statement from Sacramento. "The Dream Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us." Currently, illegal immigrant students in California must pay resident tuition rates if they graduated from a state high school and are actively seeking to legalize their immigration status, officials said. The other half of the California Dream Act was signed into law by Brown in July and allows undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges. That law, called AB 130, was needed because the University of California and California State University systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students, citing vagueness in laws, said the legislative aide to California Dream Act's author, state Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los Angeles). Cedillo called Saturday's signing "historic" and path-breaking for the United States -- coming at a time when many states such as Alabama and Arizona are passing aggressive laws targeting undocumented immigrants. Some of those laws are being challenged in court. "The signing of now both parts of the California Dream Act will send a message across the country that California is prepared to lead the country with a positive and productive vision for how we approach challenging issues related to immigration," Cedillo said in a statement.	1

A Florida jury has recommended the death penalty for a plumber who kidnapped, raped and murdered a police detective's daughter. Denise Lee's frantic 911 call was the centerpiece of her killer's trial. Michael King, 38, showed no reaction Friday afternoon as the jury's 12-0 decision was announced in Sarasota. Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. King was convicted a week ago of first-degree murder and related offenses in the January 17, 2008, death of Denise Lee, a 21-year-old mother of two boys. Nathan Lee and Sgt. Dave Goff, the victim's husband and father, remained composed in court. They had maintained a daily presence in the courtroom during a trial that included the heartbreaking tape of Denise Lee's frantic 911 call on her captor's cell phone.  Watch the jury recommend death » In Florida, a jury's recommendation for a death sentence is advisory. King will be formally sentenced later. Judges rarely overturn a jury's unanimous decision. Jurors Marcia Burns and Pat O'Quinn told reporters that defense testimony about King's head injury from a sledding accident and his low IQ carried little weight in the jury room. Denise Lee's father and husband had hoped for the death penalty. "I don't think he should be able to live another day," Nathan Lee said Friday as he awaited the verdict. Lee and Goff told the jury that she was a bright young woman who put aside her career ambitions to marry her college sweetheart and raise their two boys, now 2 and 3. "She was everything we could wish for in a daughter and more," Goff said. Several jurors had tears in their eyes as Nathan Lee described his wife as a devoted mother who was nursing one son and potty-training another when a stranger abducted her from their home. "I was so proud to call her my wife," he said. "Denise was the love of my life, my soul mate. I knew after our first date that I had found the perfect girl." He added that their boys "know their beautiful, courageous mommy has gone to heaven and now is an angel." King's siblings spoke of how a childhood sledding accident left him with a head injury that contributed to a lifetime of troubles. One expert described the injury as a "divot" in his brain.	1

Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: BOCES COAL INDUSTRY SAYS IT MAY HAVE TO ELIMINATE 1,600 JOBS IN 2002.05/07/2001Business Standard10.15amBOCES COAL INDUSTRY SAYS IT MAY HAVE TO ELIMINATE 1,600 JOBS IN 2002. The coal ministry said last week that it may have to cut the number of employees of the two major coal mines in Jammu region by 2,000 in 2002, as it struggles to meet the power cut generation target of 42,000MW per year. A decision to start the process of reducing the working force at Hindalco's Sarsaparba coal mine, which is estimated to have required a cut of 1,600 in 2002, was taken last week, although the company is reluctant to make the announcement. In August alone, there were 18 days of power cuts due to power theft at the national grid. There were 4,744 MW of power thefts due to power theft in August, as against 16,000 MW of power theft which had been recorded in August 2000. For the current year, there have been 4,744 MW of power theft as against 8,000 MW of power theft. A meeting was also called for June 2001 for the purpose of rationalising the existing work forces. The state's Coal Ministry said the state government had asked to reduce the workforce to reduce cost and the new work plans for 2002 are being prepared by the central government in a time bound manner. The ministry, however, said the government had decided not to take further action to curtail the employment in the state till 2002. Meanwhile, the state power distribution company (PWD) has not raised any objections to the proposal of the ministry of coal to reduce the workforce at the Sarsaparba Mine. The power minister of the state, Rakesh Sood, told Business Standard that the ministry had taken note of the proposal and agreed to work on it with the central government. "We are still reviewing	0
A shadowy figure in a wave near children swimming at a southern California beach has experts disagreeing. Discovery Channel shark expert Jeff Kurr calls it a great white shark, but shark expert David Shiffman  says it's not.The sighting was witnessed by a mother and daughter who were walking their dogs in the surf.The shark was observed by two teenagers who were walking a nearby section of beach, according to the Los Angeles Times.The shark swam past them before continuing on to another part of the beach, the newspaper reported.The shark has since been "captured" and put on display at the Shark Lab in Marina del Rey, the Times reported.It is believed to be at least a 14-foot great white shark, the Times reported.A great white shark is twice the length of the Great White in Hawaii, which is between 17 to 18 feet long. A great white shark can easily weigh 40 tons, according to Discovery Channel.The Great White is native to the waters off North America, and are found in waters from New England to the Mediterranean.The shark has also been spotted in waters off Florida, the UK, and the Netherlands.The Great White is found in shallow waters, particularly following the fall weather events.Great White sharks, a relative of the white shark, differ from other sharks, as they do not have any teeth.Sharks feed mainly in the water by filtering water, and may be seen feeding on small fish, crabs and squid.Great white sharks can be aggressive and will strike at a distance. They will sometimes take a bite from a shark as a warning before they attack."A shark can be a nuisance to a child by threatening their toy or even drowning it with a flick of their tail, but they are not going to attack," Kurr told The Associated Press earlier this week."We are not trying to say that these two individuals were the aggressors or the ones who started the incident. The shark we're about to release is a juvenile, not fully grown."The shark was put on display by the Shark Lab, which has a purpose other than to study and protect sharks, the Associated Press reported."It's sort of like a show at the zoo," said David Shiffman, a shark expert at the Long Beach Aquarium."This is	0
The deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi underscores the gaping power vacuum across Libya since the toppling of Moammar Gadhafi's regime last year. Fighting groups that battled Gadhafi have stepped in to maintain law and order after the fall of the regime, an expert on post-Gadhafi Libya told CNN. Most of the groups are simply neighborhood watch entities. But some include hard-line Muslim Salafis and have "a very Islamist orientation," said Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The group accused of being behind the consulate assault, the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, is said to be pro-al Qaeda. Ex-SEALs, online gaming maven among Benghazi dead "The problem is that the Libyan army and the Libya police forces effectively disintegrated," Wehrey said. "These groups are basically running the show" throughout much of Libya. Another analyst, Andrew Lebovich, a Washington-based researcher focused on security issues in North Africa and the Sahel, said the militias, criminal groups, and hard-line Islamist groups in Libya make up a "somewhat diffuse" environment. "Some groups, such as the Ansar al-Sharia Brigades in Benghazi and Derna and the Imprisoned Omar Abdel Rahman Brigades have been involved in increasing shows of force and outright attacks against Western and other targets in Libya in recent months," he said. Wehrey, in speaking to CNN, cited two of his recent essays about security in Libya. One was in Foreign Affairs in July and the other appeared Wednesday on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace website. He said the fledgling government is in a bind. Officials are trying to demobilize and reintegrate the militias and bring these groups into the government security forces, he said. But the militia members across Libya remain loyal to their groups and distrust the new government's authority, in part because of the "taint" of a link to the Gadhafi regime, Wehrey said. The government has used militia commanders to quell tribal fighting, subcontracted border control and defense of oil installations to small brigades, and used armed groups to provide security during elections. In Benghazi, he said, ballots for an election were stored and counted at the headquarters of the city's strongest militia. Six things to know about the attack	1
The search continued Tuesday for as many as 67 people missing after a boat carrying about 200 Haitians capsized, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted this crowded boat last week and Â­has been searching for as many as 67 people sinceâ¦As the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy approached, we ask the question: Is a hurricane an acceptable excuse to let thousands of children fall through the cracks? We live with the consequences of political decision-making for more years than most people can count. The problem is that, unlike political decisions made in the abstract, consequences of hurricane relief decisions are real. The decision to leave the U.S. children at risk of starving or dying, or to leave them as orphans, is not in the abstract and is a consequence of the decision. The decisions to leave children behind or not has consequences, a problem that many people, including in this blog, are not prepared for.This is a post-H1N1 blog post, as there is no vaccine available to prevent this illness. The vaccine is just a means of treating this contagious disease, as the virus is unable to enter the body when taken orally.To get some perspective on the problem, it's useful to note that in one year, the United States has spent about $700 billion on the Department of Homeland Security and $600 billion in military operations. Of course, the military operation is a subset of the Department of Homeland Security, which also includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Guard, and the other elements of the Department of Homeland Security. These agencies, of course, could have been used for this mission and would have been if needed. However, they were never needed. The decision was made to let children die unnecessarily rather than get them the vaccines needed to keep them from getting sick, a decision that was made by the executive branch, which means it was made by Congress.It is worth mentioning that, as with most government operations, there is no way to measure the actual cost. Estimates vary between $2 billion and $20 billion per month, that for one year. In other words, we spend between $2 billion and $20 billion per year for an operation that costs $700 billion per year. Of course, the $700 billion is for the entire year, so we are only talking about $100 billion per year. But we are talking about all	0
A gunman killed three people and wounded at least five at the house of a mayoral candidate in the Philippines before polls opened on Monday, a military spokeswoman said. The attack happened around 2:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. Sunday ET) Â It was not clear if the gunman had been in the area before the shooting. It came as polls opened in one city after two deadly attacks claimed by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, or NDF. ÂThe gunman was killed or captured in the attack, said the spokesman of the police in Manila. The NDF has claimed responsibility in both cases.The shooting at the home of Nung Ramo was the second of its kind in less than a week. On Sunday, Philippine soldiers shot dead a suspected Abu Sayyaf member as he tried to escape.The Philippine military is known for its tight security along the country's northeast, from the capital to Manila, and many voters in the Manila area come from areas with poor security.(Photo of the shooting site)Insecurity has long been a major obstacle in Philippine politics, making the polls the scene of repeated bloodshed and killings. The country's security forces have in the past been accused of human rights abuses and of using excessive force.In a press briefing on Monday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the security forces have an excellent record."You go to any area in the country, it's safe," Lorenzana told reporters. "The level of security, which one can expect, is quite high."(Photo of the scene)The violence came as the first round of election polls opened for the mayors of seven cities in the country. Voters will vote for the mayor of each of the cities in the first round of balloting.(Photo of the scene)The NDF said in a statement that it was behind the shootings, which followed an earlier attack in Manila on Monday."The NDF condemns in the strongest terms the attack in Manila and will continue to make the life of its members and supporters a living hell while working to build a liberated and sovereign nation," the statement said.The military also condemned the attack, and said the gunman was wearing a military uniform which was captured on video.(Photo of the attack scene)The NDF is believed to be made up	0

Dr. Mehmet Oz has been under fire recently for promoting weight loss products on TV's "The Dr. Oz Show" that aren't backed by a lot of scientific evidence. Now a study supporting one of those products, diet pills made with green coffee bean extract, has been withdrawn by its lead researchers. "The sponsors of the study cannot assure the validity of the data so we, Joe Vinson and Bryan Burnham, are retracting the paper," the pair of scientists posted online. The small study, published in 2012 in the journal Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy, found that the main ingredient in green coffee beans helped human participants lose, on average, 18 pounds over 22 weeks. It was funded by Applied Food Sciences Inc. This year, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint (PDF) against the company, saying it paid researchers in India to conduct a trial on Green Coffee Antioxidant. The FTC says the study's unnamed lead investigator "repeatedly: (1) altered the weights and other key measurements of the subjects; (2) changed the length of the trial; and (3) confused which subjects took either the placebo or GCA at various points during the trial." In the complaint, the FTC says that Applied Food Sciences asked Vinson and Burnham to write up the India researcher's study results for publication but that the pair of scientists never reviewed the raw data, despite noting several discrepancies in the data sets they received. "We retracted the paper because of an error in one of (the) data points on the BMI graph and because, as the FTC pointed out to us, there was inadequate disclosure of diet restrictions on the subjects and inadequate disclosure of the blinding procedures for the supplements given the subjects," Vinson and Burnham said in a joint statement Thursday. The researchers added that while they did not have the raw data collections, they did seek clarification from the India researcher on how the study was conducted and "at no time did we suspect the data provided were fraudulent." "Applied Food Sciences knew or should have known that this botched study didn't prove anything," Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said after the company settled with the FTC in September. "In publicizing the results, it helped fuel the green coffee phenomenon." The FTC says Oz also played a role in promoting the diet pills. Oz was grilled by a Senate panel in June over the weight loss products being publicized on his show.	1
Is the ring the thing? Rumors are flying that Lady Gaga and her boyfriend, "Chicago Fire" actor Taylor urn’s vernon may be getting serious. The reality TV star has remained mostly quiet since news broke that she and Taylor are dating. But last month, she posted to her Tumblr account an e-mail from Taylor, saying that he was "extremely taken aback" by her behavior. Gaga, meanwhile, has remained mostly quiet about whether or not she and Taylor are getting serious, too, recently posting several times to her Tumblr account a video of "we're gonna get the best of this guy" from her and Taylor's recent vacation. On Valentine's Day, she wrote, "The guys at the hotel made me hot chocolate and we drank it all last night and my head felt great in the morning." Now, there are two new updates in the Lady Gaga Tumblr account. Check out some of the most entertaining ones below. You already knew Lady Gaga and Taylor were in love? Well, here are the rest. Lady Gaga Gave Taylor a Valentine's Day Gift He was extremely taken aback by her behavior, Taylor wrote. The reason she posted the photo is because it made her feel closer to her guy. She always felt like they "had a connection." This post about Taylor's relationship with Lady Gaga is the first time we've seen him express his gratitude to what Lady Gaga did for him, according to People. We were always told Taylor was the one who introduced Lady Gaga to Taylor Swift, but they have always told the press that they were "best friends," People and USA Today confirmed. One tabloid speculated that Taylor was trying to show that he loved her during the romantic vacation. Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift on Breakup Rumors and speculation began last fall that Gaga and Taylor Swift were break up, but this isn't the first hint of it, USA Today reported. And while they "both seem to know that rumors are circulating," they don't seem to know "if it's true," they wrote. "They have had other, more private, conversations and seem to want to keep that aspect of their lives private." Gaga and Taylor had a few laughs sharing their fun stories on vacation, but they "didn't spend a lot of time talking about it," People wrote. Gaga and Taylor, however, had "more than a few" good laughs, a source told People. When they were on their vacations last year, Gaga and Taylor went	0
Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year. The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying Â“I have decided to retire. I wish someone my age could have done anything that Â“would have made up for all the mistakes I've made over the past 35 years.Â“"This is a very difficult decision for me and my family to make," he added. "It is not an easy thing to admit that you've made a mistake. You just don't want to admit it. It's a very difficult thing. For us and for my family, it's very, very tough."The news comes as a shock to the House GOP leadership in Washington who had hoped that the Michigan Republican, who has represented the area since 1995, would run for re-election this year. He was expected to face a tough challenge from Democrat John Barrow and former Democratic U.S. Rep. John Conyers.But Rogers' decision not to run for re-election is an even bigger surprise for some in his district, including his fellow Republicans who say they had no idea he was leaving in December.I have to say, I have been a fan of Mike Rogers for some time. He is a straight shooter and a great representative for Michigan. From the beginning he has been pro-active and in my view he has led the way on many of our national security issues. We have supported him in the past and look forward to continuing that friendship and supporting him in the future.And I would like to thank Mike for his support over the years. He has been one of the strongest advocates for the Republican Party. Thank you, Mike, for all the good work -- a job you did a tremendous job on.Rogers' decision is one of several shocking announcements that have come from House Republicans this year. In January, Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, announced he would not seek re-election and instead would return to his role as chief of staff at the White House on a part time basis. He faced a primary campaign from former Rep. Tom Cole, R-OK, who was viewed as a rising star among the Freedom Caucus. Meadows and Cole had been expected to run together against the other Republican House members, including Speaker	0
A misguided photo shoot of Air Force One over New York City in 2009 terrified residents, infuriated the president, and cost the director of the White House Military Office his job. Now, NASA is working to prevent a similar panic in ersatz images sent from the International Space Station, and to protect astronauts who may be working with the agency.In the days before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the White House Military Office (WHMO) in the Cabinet Office for Science and Technology (COST) had received a flurry of satellite photos of the World Trade Center in New York, as well as a picture of an aircraft in flight, thought to represent a plane taking off from the East Coast.The images of the two planes—a Boeing 767 and a jetliner—had been downloaded to the COST’s satellite image library, but they were in such poor quality that the photos were impossible to verify, says Bill McDonough, a retired Navy captain and the chief curator of the COST’s satellite library. The images were being downloaded to the library as part of a “satellite-borne threat-detection exercise,” McDonough says.“This was not an exercise,” McDonough says. “It was an exercise to verify that COST’s database, which contained millions of images of the planet, was of world-class quality.”There were two possible outcomes of the exercise, says COST deputy undersecretary and chief of staff, Scott Bardsley. The satellite could have delivered a false image, which would endanger NASA astronauts and technicians at the ISS. Or, the mission could have delivered an image with high spatial resolution—and its resolution would prove that the images were not false positives, but rather were of existing satellites.Bardsley says that the two possibilities forced the agency to go forward with the exercise, which was only to be conducted on four days a year. “We were going to do it on a limited amount of resources,” says Bardsley.On Sept. 24, 2010, a photograph of the Twin Towers of New York was sent out from the ISS, but its resolution was so poor—at 1-kilometer—that experts could not make out the building from a mile away. (It later was discovered that an airliner that had flown over the area during	0
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Tuesday that "Hurt Locker" producer Nicolas Chartier will not be allowed to attend the March 7 awards show because of an e-mail that has been deemed in violation of the Academy's campaigning standards. "Chartier had recently disseminated an e-mail to certain Academy voters and other film industry figures in which he solicited votes for his own picture and disparaged one of the other contending films," the Academy said in a statement Tuesday evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, Chartier's e-mail asked the message recipients to spread the word about the Iraq war movie so that the independent feature would win, "and not a $500M film," which many have interpreted as a slight against James Cameron's box-office blockbuster "Avatar." To the Academy, Chartier's appeal to voters and industry insiders crossed the line by "casting a negative or derogatory light on a competing film," which, according to the Academy's statement, is against the organization's rules. Late Monday, the Academy decided that it would rescind only Chartier's invitation, "stopping short" of pulling "The Hurt Locker" out of the running altogether. If the film wins, remaining producers Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal and Greg Shapiro will accept the award. Chartier would receive his Oscar statuette later.	1
Like so many other people of my generation, John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life. The very first piece of vinyl I actually owned -- and hadn't borrowed from my older brother -- was  'Yellow Submarine.' We'd rented a car and gone off to Liverpool to watch the Beatles at a festival at the Cavern. By the time they played 'She's Leaving Home,' I was wide awake.As a teenager who listened to Radio 1 on his Walkman, I was a "fan" with all the perks that entailed. I was a fan in other ways as well. "John" and "Paul" were my idols. It was their music that first inspired me to play my own. I was in a band together with friends in the basement of our house for the longest part of the day. The songs were always our own, and we were always playing them -- and we knew all the words.We'd been through a lot, but at the time my life revolved around the band. In fact, I was so focused on the band that I hardly ever hung around with anyone. I was on the road, in the dressing room, in the bathroom, and eating dinner as often -- or trying to eat dinner as often -- as I could. I was doing my best to make the money to buy a car for my dad. I was in England because that's where I felt at home.I learned from my band mates that my favorite music was rock music, especially "The White Album." Then of course I started watching TV and listening to records. I fell in love with the Beatles' early work -- 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' especially.I learned a great deal from my band mates, but especially Ringo, John, Paul and Pete. I'd get to see them play live quite often, and that's really the first time I'd ever seen them in concert. Seeing them on television was a real thrill, but in the real world it was the first time I'd ever been in front of a band.I knew that I had to be the greatest. I wanted to be the greatest. It was like I was in a video game. It's fun, but it's also a pain in the ass. I was very self-confident, and I didn't think like anyone else. I thought -- and even believed -- I	0
After an extensive, month-long buildup, Yahoo has finally unveiled its new logo. Overall the look is cleaner and thinner, and it is a new sans-serif typeface created by Yahoo. The logo is still purple, though a shade darker, and features all the usual uppercase letters in the same order finished off by the signature exclamation point, which dances around in some versions. Yahoo posted two flavors of the new look to its Tumblr at midnight on Thursday. One is white text on a purple background, the other purple text on white background. Both have a slight beveled effect, though it's more noticeable on the purple text. It has already replaced the logo that appears on the top left corner of Yahoo.com. "We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.," wrote CEO Marissa Mayer in a blog post on Tumblr, which Yahoo bought earlier this year. "We didn't want to have any straight lines in the logo. Straight lines don't exist in the human form and are extremely rare in nature, so the human touch in the logo is that all the lines and forms all have at least a slight curve," Mayer added in her post, which goes into exhaustive detail about the thinking behind the logo. In a recent internal poll of Yahoo employees, 87% wanted the logo changed, Mayer said. Yahoo managed to turn a simple rebranding into an impressive marketing push by dragging it out for 30 days. For the past month, the company has rotated out the logo on its homepage daily with one of the runnersup. Some of the 29 logos were a lot more unusual than the final choice, perhaps to make fans appreciate the reserved simplicity of the final look. "Sharing these logo variations prepares people for change, so there's less risk of what happened to Gap," said David Airey, a graphic designer specializing in brand identity. When Gap tried changing its logo in 2010, there was an outcry among Gap loyalists and logo enthusiasts. The clothing company eventually caved and switched back to its old logo.	1
Manny Pacquiao is threatening Floyd Mayweather Jr. with legal action following a row over drugs testing which leaves their proposed super-bout next year in doubt. Pacquiao is refusing to agree to a demand by the Mayweather camp to undergo Olympic style blood-screening in the run up to the fight, which is penciled in for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on March 13. Boxing commentators had suggested that the war of words was a pre-fight tactic by the Mayweather camp and his promoter, Golden Boy Promotions, to unsettle the Filipino, who has hit back with an angry statement on his personal Web site. "Enough is enough. These people, Mayweather Sr, Jr, and Golden Boy Promotions, think it is a joke and a right to accuse someone wrongly of using steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs," it read. "I have tried to just brush it off as a mere pre-fight ploy but I think they have gone overboard " Pacquiao, who became a five-weight world champion by beating Puerto Rican Miguel Cotto in November, claimed he would now be calling in the lawyers. "I have instructed my promoter, Bob Arum, head of Top Rank Inc, to help me out in the filing of the case as soon as possible because I have had people coming over to me now asking if I really take performance-enhancing drugs and I have cheated my way into becoming the number one boxer in the world. "I maintain and assure everyone that I have not used any form or kind of steroids and that my way to the top is a result of hard work, hard work, hard work and a lot of blood spilled from my past battles in the ring, not outside of it. "I have no idea what steroids look like and my fear in God has kept me safe and victorious through all these years." The row started earlier this week when Mayweather's promoters Golden Boy Promotions went public with their demands for blood-testing, as mandated by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and making it a condition before the super-fight went ahead. But Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said this was not necessary under the rules governing fights in Nevada and was mind games by the Mayweather camp. "We have passed every test ever given to us. We go by the commission rules, since when does the fighter make up the rules?, " he said.	1
Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody wants a federal judge to stop DVD sales of a horror movie he filmed two years ago because he's still owed $640,000 by the producers. "Giallo," filmed in Italy, never made it to  the American market. "I have nothing against the Italians," Brody, 40, tells The Associated Press. "But I'd hate to think they'd be making it for me." The actor is still under a non-disclosure agreement because he said he had to give a lecture on the movie in Rome this week. A judge in Los Angeles ordered Monday a restraining order against Brody, who made it to Los Angeles with his wife and children last Wednesday. At a news conference in Rome, Brody said DVD sales of the movie, which he shot in Venice, were part of the non-disclosure agreement. No one answered the phone. "That's ridiculous," he said. "They are lying."'We're Not Gonna Work It Anymore': Hollywood Execs React To 'Mean Girls'From 'Big Trouble' to 'Mean Girls,' Hollywood execs and stars have been reflecting on the comedies that were, and were not, so successful when they first appeared.Jan. 26, 2007  -- The producers of “Mean Girls” and “Big Trouble in Little China” didn't exactly agree on why “Mean Girls” was big, but the same could be said for their movies. "Mean Girls" is considered by many critics to be the best comedy, despite being only three years old. Its success was due, in part, to its star, Lindsay Lohan, who was a notorious party girl before moving into rehab for drug and alcohol addiction two years ago.And yet even a movie that is considered one of the best comedies of the past decade did not get the success "Mean Girls" did.“Mean Girls” debuted at No. 1 with a $30 million opening weekend. By the time the film was released two years later, “Mean Girls” had grossed $70.8 million, which was its lowest gross ever.Why does that happen?“The comedy has gotten popular and people want to try it, but it doesn't want to work,” said one Hollywood studio executive in an	0
Sen. Hillary Clinton on Saturday will officially suspend her campaign for the presidency and "express her support for Senator Obama and party unity," her campaign said Wednesday. Sen. Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she will let her supporters and party leaders decide her course. The Clinton campaign said she will make the announcement at "an event in Washington, D.C.," where she will also  thank her supporters. Sen. Barack Obama and Clinton were in Washington on Wednesday to each address the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The candidates ran into each other at the AIPAC conference and had a brief chat, Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass said. "She's an extraordinary leader of the Democratic Party and has made history alongside me over the last 16 months. I'm very proud to have competed against her," Obama told the Israel lobbying group. Obama became his party's presumptive nominee Tuesday and will be looking to unite Democrats divided by the long and contentious primary season. "I am very confident how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November," he said in a Senate hallway Wednesday. iReport.com: Obama/Clinton -- dream team or nightmare? Some say that putting Clinton on the ticket might fit the bill for uniting Democrats. Clinton lavished her opponent with praise Tuesday, saying he ran an "extraordinary race" and made politics more palatable for many.  Watch how the primary played out » Prominent Clinton backer Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, thinks the New York senator could have been "far more generous" during her speech Tuesday night after it was clear that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination. Rangel, the senior member of the New York congressional delegation and an early supporter of Clinton's presidential campaign, said Wednesday that Clinton should have been more clear about what her plans are. "I would agree that after the math was in before her speech, that she could have been far more generous in terms of being more specific and saying that she wants a Democratic victory," Rangel said on MSNBC. "I don't see what they're talking about in prolonging this," Rangel added. "There's nothing to prolong if you're not going to take the fight to the convention floor. ... I don't know why she could not have been more open in terms of doing up front what she intends to do later."	1
A timeline of events leading to the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing.The report also includes information from the U.S. Department of Energy regarding the May 20 explosion, according to a spokeswoman for the agency.According to the report, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded at 10:20 a.m. April 20, claiming 52 lives and leaving the region still reeling in the aftermath of the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.The report was prepared by BP, on behalf of the committee, using information compiled by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The committee subpoenaed documents from BP and the American Bureau of Shipping, according to committee chairman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California.According to the committee’s report, BP is the party in the most severe financial distress, while the American Bureau of Shipping is in a better position than other parties and therefore had the most information to make the most informed decisions regarding how, and when, to shut down the Deepwater Horizon, the committee said.BP was the natural operator of the rig, and the U.S. Coast Guard had been hired to oversee the operations of the rig. BP was the company that was most affected when the blowout occurred.The committee’s investigation found that BP is trying to avoid paying fines and other liabilities resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident, and is continuing to conceal information and blame the event on “the uncontrollable, chaotic, and incompetent actions of a small group of men.”BP was given permission by the administration of former president George W. Bush to pay for any liabilities resulting from the BP disaster, which occurred in April 2010. BP has said it has paid $20 billion to date.Waxman said in a statement that the committee’s report “is another major setback for the company and raises additional questions about the company’s ability to comply with the federal law and get relief from the environmental and criminal liabilities.”Among the findings in the report, committee members said, were that BP concealed information about a decision in 2004 by top management officials to shut down the well and that senior management officials hid from BP the results of an internal investigation into the Deepwater	0
Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday. The 19-year-old could also face murder charges at the state level. At the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev was in serious condition while being held in federal custody, federal prosecutors were formulating the charges. The development came amid questions as to what's next for the suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. President Barack Obama said he's keenly interested in answers. "There are still many unanswered questions," Obama said Friday night. "Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers." Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170. On Thursday night, they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer before the older brother was killed during a shootout with police. Dzhokar Tsarnaev was captured Friday night after he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts. When will the suspect be in court? Tsarnaev could be in a courtroom for an arraignment soon. Ordinarily at an arraignment, the suspect is provided a lawyer, and the defense and prosecution try to make a case for whether he should be released on bail. "He will not get bail obviously," said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. "They will set a preliminary hearing that could happen in the next 30 days. He will be indicted with the grand jury. And that's when the case will begin." After the charges are filed, the Federal Public Defender Office in Boston will be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, according to Miriam Conrad, the federal public defender for the Massachusetts district. Should bomber suspect be questioned without a lawyer? For now, the government is invoking the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights, a Justice Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity. In ordinary cases, a suspect is told by police he has the right to remain silent and he has the right to a lawyer. But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham.	1
Ebola is very much on the minds of Americans, as 8 in 10 Americans believe someone new will be diagnosed with the disease in the coming weeks. But there is overwhelming confidence in the federal government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, a new CNN/ORC International Poll shows. More than 7 in 10 Americans say the federal government can stop an Ebola epidemic, and 54% believe the federal government is doing a "good job" in addressing the disease. The high marks on the government's response to Ebola come at the same time that President Barack Obama's overall approval rating is only 45% and Americans are angry over the direction of the country. A slightly smaller majority of Americans, 53%, think that hospitals and healthcare workers in their community are prepared to treat an Ebola case, but only 26% believe that someone in their area will become infected with the disease in the next few weeks. "Most Americans seem to recognize that they are not in personal jeopardy themselves," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "In fact, the vast majority of Americans probably don't know anyone who has ever been to West Africa." The poll comes as a national discussion over how to process people traveling from the Ebola hot zones into the United States is taking place. It shows that only 3 in 10 Americans believe the U.S. government should prevent foreign citizens traveling from West Africa from entering the U.S, while 2 in 10 Americans say that U.S. citizens returning from the hot zone should be stopped from entering the country. A strong majority, though, are in favor of quarantining people who show signs of having contracted the disease. More than 7 in 10 Americans say the federal government should take steps to treat Ebola in both Africa and the U.S., while 27% believe that it should be addressed only here in the U.S. The U.S. government has sent military troops to the hot zone to provide assistance. On Monday, 11 personnel including Army Major General Darryl A. Williams were placed under "controlled monitoring" at a U.S. base in Italy after returning from West Africa. Americans are split 50% to 48% when asked if they would take an Ebola vaccine if it became available. In terms of the midterm elections, 36% of Americans say Ebola will be "extremely important" to their vote for Congress -- placing it right in the middle of the most important issues on people's minds, according to the poll.	1
All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison. Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour  and his administration had sought to free. The pardons were granted by Gov. Phil Bryant, who followed Barbour's example in pardoning four members of the Legislature and former state Supreme Court justices, only to see the Justice Department move to block the pardons in federal court. Last week the Department of Justice filed a brief in U.S. District Court in Oxford, Mississippi, arguing that the pardons violated federal law by violating the supremacy clause, which grants federal supremacy over state laws.The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Bush administration's refusal to allow state prisoners to be freed because of the death penalty. In a 5-4 decision, the high court decided a lower court's decision upholding the state's death sentences will not be overturned.The decision was a landmark in the modern death penalty jurisprudence, as the Supreme Court's prior rulings of 1996 and 2002 had decided that all life-without-parole sentences were unconstitutional. Now the high court rejected an appeal that the administration refused to grant release to more than 200 death row inmates, stating that the inmates could decide for themselves whether they want to be executed. The justices said the death penalty is a sentence of last resort, not an alternative sentence, and that it is a form of punishment that must be imposed for a crime no greater than that against which it is carried out.The court's decision means all of the inmates, except those already scheduled to die in the next year, will die in the electric chair.The three-judge panel of judges noted that the high court had not addressed the question of what procedures a prison must provide for inmates to have a fair shot at parole, a question that Congress in 1996 raised by passing a federal law to ensure that inmates have meaningful opportunities for parole hearings. The high court's decision is only binding on those states that had the opportunity to weigh in earlier on the matter, leaving them in limbo. Two other states, Ohio and Arizona, filed a brief in Tuesday's case, joining Texas in defending the policies that have led to the death penalty for at least 30 years.The case was brought by the inmates as the result of a lawsuit filed by NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. The inmates were	0
A pedophile suspect who became the subject of an international manhunt this week after an appeal from Interpol has been detained in the United States. Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment. Wayne Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hollywood Wayne�?As the world watches this saga unfold Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with its multiple twists and turns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the many theories flying around Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ one thing is certain: the criminal justice system of the world has failed to take this Ã¢â‚¬Å“human tragedyÃ¢â‚¬Â seriously.With the world watching, itÂs time for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s justice system to wake up and realize that not only should the media cover this story, but so should law enforcement agencies across the country.A pedophile suspect with a long list of arrests in the United States has been convicted of being a pedophile in France.In a French court on Tuesday, the man, who has been identified only as J., pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old male while under the age of 18 and under the age of consent.J. was under the age of 18 when he went to a hotel room in Paris with the 18-year-old between July 31, 2008, and Aug 1, 2008. J. penetrated the victim with his fingers and penis, and forced the victim to perform oral sex.As part of his plea agreement, J. admitted to other sexual offenses in the United States. He had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge in Louisiana in 2008 and was placed on probation.J. will be sentenced at a later date.In this case, though, there have been at least as many people who claim they are guilty of being guilty of being guilty of being guilty of being guilty of pedophilia as there are people claiming to be guilty of being pedophiles.People claim itâ€™s because they have been abused, people claim itâ€™s because they were sexually groomed, people claim itâ€™s because they were sexually abused as children; itâ€™s because they were traumatized as a	0
The Thai army declared martial law throughout the country Tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled Prime Minister said the government didn't know about beforehand. "They took this action unilaterally. The government is having a special meeting regarding this. We have to watch and see if the army chief honors his declaration of impartiality," the aide said, describing the situation as "half a coup d'etat." Lt. Gen. Nipat Thonglek told CNN the move was not a coup. "The Army aims to maintain peace, order and public safety for all groups and all parties," a ticker running on the army's television channel said. "People are urged not to panic, and can carry on their business as usual. Declaring martial law is not a coup d'etat." Martial law went into effect at 3 a.m. on Tuesday, the ticker said. All Thai TV stations are being guarded by the military, Thai public television announced, showing pictures of soldiers and armored vehicles taking positions outside broadcast facilities in the country's capital. In a statement read on Thai television, the military declared that all of the country's radio and television stations must suspend their normal programs "when it is needed." The dramatic announcements come days after the head of the army issued a stern warning after political violence had surged in the country's capital. Political tensions have been running high in Thailand. Supporters and opponents of the country's government have staged mass protests in recent days, and earlier this month a top court removed caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office, along with nine cabinet ministers. It's too soon to tell whether the military's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them, analysts said. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor, described the situation as "very volatile." "This is a precarious time now for the army," he said. "They have to be even-handed." If the military appears to be favoring one side, he said, violence could escalate rather than cool down. "If it's seen as favoring one side or the other side, then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military," he said. Paul Quaglia, director at Bangkok-based risk assessment firm PQA Associates, described the situation as "martial law light."	1
The Colorado couple accused of carrying out a bizarre hoax involving their son and a huge balloon is "not running from the law" and deserves the presumption of innocence, their attorney said Monday. Richard Heene has told reporters that a runaway balloon incident involving his son was "absolutely no hoax." "The sheriff having a press conference saying that they're guilty does not make them so," David Lane told CNN's "American Morning." Authorities say the event -- in which the tearful couple claimed their 6-year-old may have been trapped in the flying-saucer-like contraption floating through the air -- was staged. Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said. Lane, asked Monday by CNN about his client's state of mind, said it was "what you would expect someone's state of mind to be after law enforcement searched your house, seized your property, held a press conference announcing you're about to be charged with felony criminal charges. Your state of mind would be rather upset and you would feel somewhat under siege, which is exactly how the family feels at this point."  Watch how attorney says family is dealing with hoax allegations » During the incident Thursday, as millions worldwide watched live TV coverage of the contraption floating above northern Colorado, authorities did not pick up on any deceptive behavior, Alderden said. But that night, during an interview with CNN's "Larry King Live," the boy, Falcon, gave authorities an "Aha! moment," Alderden said. "You guys said we did this for the show," Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him.  Watch how boy explain balloon incident » Richard and Mayumi Heene said their son was simply confused. But authorities enacted a "game plan" of getting the truth, Alderden said. The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax. They wanted to keep the couple's trust, Alderden said. Investigators pursued separate interviews and polygraph tests with the Heene parents Saturday, then searched the couple's home early Sunday for computer records, phone records, video recordings, and other potential evidence, Alderden said.	1
A day after the United States promised new missile defense interceptors to guard against a North Korean attack, Pyongyang responded Saturday by blasting the Americans' "hostile policy" and saying it won't negotiate with them  until America ceases its provocative acts against the Korean peninsula."We will use our nuclear deterrent first, and then we'll see," North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, told reporters on Saturday in a rare news conference, according to The Associated Press.The meeting, which lasted nearly one hour, was a high-stakes showdown between the two long-time adversaries that underscored a potential shift in the volatile situation on the Korean peninsula.North Korea warned, "We will strike anyone who provokes us with war." It also accused the U.S. of spreading "a nuclear shadow" over the North.Kim on Friday threatened to destroy South Korea and United States and said he was ready to go to the "direst" places with the nuclear arsenal.He accused the North of carrying out provocations that have drawn the U.S. and South Korea — and, he suggested, others — into a "nuclear showdown" with it, without elaborating.North Korea's threats are the latest indication of Kim's willingness to use such weapons against the U.S., even after being pushed to the bargaining table by President Donald Trump in June.The two Koreas agreed to hold working-level talks in the truce village of Panmunjom on Friday, but the two sides failed to finalize any specific date. The meeting was set to include a U.S. delegation led by John Kirby, the State Department's senior director for East Asian and Pacific affairs.Kim made that a condition of the meeting, telling reporters that "this was the first time in my life" that the U.S. is willing to negotiate, the AP said.North Korea's statement on Saturday evening did not mention the U.S. at all, suggesting it was not ready to make a deal with the U.S. and that a war-like posture will have to be maintained.“Our weapons are not for negotiations; they are for self defense.”—North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesmanThe meeting comes after North Korea had threatened to destroy South Korea and the U.S. with its nuclear weapons a day earlier.

A struggling German soccer team is offering a refund to its fans who traveled to another city to watch it suffer a 4-0 loss. Cottbus are second from the bottom of the German Bundesliga. More than 600 Energie Cottbus supporters saw their team suffer its sixth loss in seven games when it received a 4-0 drubbing Friday at the hands of another team, Schalke. Cottbus are second from the bottom in the German Bundesliga's ranking and is in danger of being relegated to a lower league at the end of the season. The team posted a Web statement Saturday headlined, "Sorry, Energie Fans!" In it, the team said its players "did not manage at any time to stand up to a high-class opponent with our particular qualities of passion, dedication and one-on-one duels." "Certainly one can lose at Schalke," the team manager Steffen Heidrich said in the statement. "Nevertheless we did not put up enough defense against the class of the individuals of this opponent." The team said it will announce details in the coming weeks of how fans can receive a refund on their admission ticket. "I welcome the apologetic gesture of the team to its fans," Heidrich said. "Real compensation must actually be given in the coming matches." CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.	1
Inter Milan will learn their early group opponents as they begin their defense of the Champions League crown when the draw is made in Monaco on Thursday. Milan, who iced a three-game league-clinching win over Inter two seasons ago, will face Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal.After their shock 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday, Inter Milan won’t have a day off before heading to Germany for the second leg on Aug. 29 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. Bayern was able to win 2-1 on Saturday in Munich after a thrilling 5-5 draw at the Allianz Arena.The first leg of Milan’s third-straight Champions League quarterfinal will be played on Sept. 16, and they’ll close out their group in the same fashion they did against Bayern. Inter Milan is the No. 1 seed in the competition in the eyes of the UEFA coefficient.It’s a tough draw for Milan, which could be an advantage. Dortmund, whose league-leading 12-game unbeaten streak is over, played to a 2-2 draw with Bayern last season.“It is a very challenging group,” Inter Coach Sinisa Miskovic said. “It can be a good test to find your characteristics. It will be a good experience to find out who you are and where you want to be. But we must be united and focus on what we need to do.”Milan has a strong shot at winning the Champions League before meeting Dortmund, but they’re in an unfamiliar position. They could either win or finish second in the Serie A-to-European Cup UEFA Champions League crossover competition.Milan, already guaranteed third place in Serie A with its win against Inter, has been drawn in the same group as Boca Juniors, with only Inter Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona on a bye in the round of 32.“It’s very nice,” Inter forward Hernan Crespo said. “We’re in the same group with Boca Juniors, who is a good team that we know well.

A man celebrating his friend's impending marriage fell to his death from a Black Hawk, Colorado, hotel window early Saturday, police said. Dirk Anderson, 29, was sitting on the ledge of an open window in the 11th-floor room at the Lady Luck Hotel and Casino when the screen on which he was leaning gave way, according to reports by CNN television affiliates KUSA and KCNC. The Thornton, Colorado, man landed on the roof of a parking garage five levels below, police said. While there was alcohol at the bachelor party, investigators said they don't know if Anderson had been drinking before his fall. There was no evidence of horseplay and it appeared to be an accident, police said. Black Hawk, a 19th-century gold-mining town, is home to several casinos that attract tourists and gamblers from Denver, 35 miles away. Woman on first date plunges to her death off 17th-floor balcony CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.	1
Jesse James' Nazi hat was a gift from a Jewish mentor and does not make him a neo-Nazi, his lawyer said Wednesday. James is at a treatment facility "to deal with ills of the mind,'' attorney James J. Gilligan said in a telephone interview. Gilligan declined to comment on the contents of the letter, which James wrote before an interview with the New York Daily News. "In many ways, this is a very benign letter. The letter is, in effect, a love letter,'' Gilligan said. 'Love letter?''If only that were so. In its July 15 article on the "James" case, the Times took it upon itself to announce: "The trial of Jesse James is about whether he was a 'good boy' who 'couldn't hurt a fly,' or a violent man who 'came from the devil' who 'belonged to a secret world of violence and blood.' " Yet James' first public interview took place two days before the story ran, with an interview with a reporter from the Minneapolis Star and Tribune of Minneapolis, who took the reporter on a tour of James' family home. The reporter asked James why he wrote the letter to the Times, and James replied that the letter "came by mistake.''He insisted that he was not a neo-Nazi. In fact, he told the reporter, "There's no truth to it." James refused to identify the Jewish family from whom he sought a gift of the Nazi cap. "I'll tell you who I am and I hope you won't print any of this," he said. The reporter interviewed Jesse James, who seemed genuinely contrite and remorseful about the letter.The James case became a cause célèbre because of James' behavior on trial, which has been viewed as a racist act with no redeeming features. James, who had been described as a "mixture of James Dean and Charles Manson," walked into a St. Paul courtroom and sat in a cell, refusing to respond to the judge's attempts to elicit a confession. The judge called his behavior "a disgrace to the legal system." When he finally agreed to speak in court, he said in a statement that he had "no recollection of the event and that he had been intoxicated at the time."Since James' conviction in 1981, two books, "The Trial of Jesse James," by former Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Michael	0
Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa informed Broadwell's ime that she will not stand trial based on an agreement her lawyer signed in December.Broadwell has already entered a plea of guilty to one charge of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. She will face up to five years in prison for a crime that, while it's not as serious as a felony murder, was nonetheless the result of Broadwell taking the computer home, looking at it, and then sending it to a stranger.Petraeus is due to arrive in the U.S. by May 15, 2013 to be sentenced for his two charges of unauthorized access of a government computer and lying to a federal agent. If he did these things while employed by the CIA, Petraeus would likely have been facing charges under the Espionage Act of 1947, if not the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, which Broadwell's attorney, Robert Wolf, had brought to the attention of Congress as a result of his investigation. And in the current world of cybercrime prosecutions, it seems, no one should be able to send someone like Broadwell a text with an innocuous message that, while technically legal, is highly disturbing to the recipient.Broadwell has maintained that she did not believe her actions were illegal. But there is a clear line the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa drew between a federal crime and a state crime. Florida's cyberstalking statute carries a potential penalty of three years probation and a $1,000 fine. But, as Broadwell learned, there are situations where federal prosecutors will accept a plea agreement before trial, even one that carries a state-level minimum sentence.Petraeus has denied sending sexually explicit text messages to Broadwell, or even looking at or talking about her using her computer to send them.The Department of Justice (DOJ) could not confirm whether Broadwell's plea agreement with the federal government would be honored. But, in a statement on Tuesday, it did confirm that Attorney General Eric Holder would be announcing the results of the Petraeus investigation sometime during the week of May 26—and that Petraeus would not be the topic of any announcement.Petraeus has already been sentenced to three years in prison	0
better known by his aww-shucks, all-American nickname, Johnny Football -- was not allowed to give any interviews, in accordance with head coach Kevin Sumlin's rules for all freshmen players. Once the regular season ended, and  Johnny finally got his turn to do so, he came out with a new series of videos.The first came four days after the team's loss to Michigan State in the Cotton Bowl game. Johnny was in one of the team's hotel rooms, trying to get out of an early night. His life changed forever the night before the game when he got into a fight with another teammate.The next day, January 13, Johnny's team had the worst loss of Johnny Football's career. In the season opener at Texas, the Longhorns defeated the  Aggies 23-7.The next morning, Johnny started his workout. Two days later, the  Sooners suffered their worst loss of the season. Johnny was there as quarterback.A month later, Johnny began what would soon become a weekly video series called, "Johnny Football." In these videos, he shared his personal story, explaining his struggles on and off the field, and addressing a variety of topics, such as whether he would have been a better quarterback at the University of Texas, whether he would choose to play football over baseball -- which he did -- and why he chose to play for Sumlin.After the season concluded, Johnny went home to visit his family, where, in lieu of the normal gifts of presents for all the family, he gave his mother a special gift -- his love for the University of Oklahoma and the football team. He would later say that he loved the school and the football team as a whole.The story about the fight with his teammate and the first appearance of the "Johnny Football" video began with Johnny having a fight with his roommate,  Anthony Boone (the younger brother of former college basketball star Toney Boone). According to Boone, Johnny got into a fight with another former teammate. After the fight, Johnny was told by an official that he would have to vacate the hotel suite and that he would forfeit the next day's practice.A few days later, Johnny's coach asked him to come over and work out with the team. When Johnny walked over to his old room, he got into a fistfight with Boone. The two were soon asked to leave the hotel, where	0
More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars. "The fusion" of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel its nations "to fuse their sovereignty" as well "into that of a single European state." To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability. A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group's greater good. That was 1952. A time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union. Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly isn't the set of "united states" Monnet hoped for. Ones with the same deep-seated convictions and beliefs. The glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Since then, a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of bringing nations together, their finances have threatened to tear them apart. This leaves us with one fundamental question: if the EU's main task is no longer to provide peace, and it can't guarantee prosperity either, then what should its role be? Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has accomplished much for its members. It has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence, providing protection and strength in numbers. It has boosted prosperity, thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market, while consumer and workers' rights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking. But the EU has also drifted far from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive Brussels-based bureaucratic machine which, critics say, is stifling industry and is pushing members like the UK towards the exit door. The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision. The EU faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc's strong and weak economies alike.	1
Right in the midst of Monday night's Emmy pandemonium, 20th Century  (which is owned by AETN) premiered to a 1.1 in the demo, up a tenth from the 2.8 of its second season. The CW's bubblegum drama Dynasty scored a 2.1 and its first season-best 3.4 rating among women, as it continues to make inroads against ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX and PBS. In women's terms, 20th's season averaged a 1.6 over its second. But even that's down from the 1.9 and 2.3 in its freshman season, and a more modest 1.4 in its second, so you have to go back to the old days for those numbers. It's probably true that women may have felt more comfortable seeing the show's lead male character become a dad than seeing a female character in that role (although that seems to be changing). And though many people have been critical of the show's handling of certain hot-button  issues, in the end, it was a welcome change of pace, and one that should have some staying power. But it's still early in the season, and there's no surefire way to measure how popular viewers are for one show against another.The show that premiered in the 6.4 million range is CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which added a 1.6 over its second season, its best rating among adults 25-54, and a 1.9 among adults 18-49. Still, the CBS show has been in decline in the last few years, and is currently on a 10-week slide. So while CSI isn't likely to win big this year, it's got a fighting chance. Also strong on the Big 4 nets tonight are the CBS shows The Mentalist, CSI, Criminal Minds and NCIS.ABC's Modern Family, the network's highest-rated comedy, had its highest-rated Season Nine premiere ever last night at a 3.9 rating (the season's best in adults 18-49 and a 14-share in viewers, up a tenth from its second) in the 18-49 demographic. The season averaged a 3.2 in the demo, up eight tenths from its sophomore, plus a 3.7 in total viewers. The 9th season opener won't win any awards, but it was a solid debut for the network's top comedy.NBC	0
A large group of youths from an ethnic militia loyal to former South Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar is marching for the city of Bor, just days after it was retaken by the government amid heavy fighting, officials said. Â The youth from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are marching across the city for the first time, after years of tension and fighting with the government and its army, local officials said.The youths, who are members of the youth wing of the paramilitary group from Juba, are marching to Bor city, the capital of the southern state of Jonglei, to demand the release of their political leader, who fled to the capital last month to escape an army campaign led by President Salva Kiir.The youth are a few kilometres from the South Sudanese Armed Forces (SSAF) headquarters, which is being used as a staging post for their advance, said a military officer in Bor, who asked not to be identified.The RSF is a militia fighting for Machar, who defected from President Kiir’s government three months ago, after the two men met for the first time last July. Both men pledged to unite the country and bring about democracy, but the RSF, whose leader is Machar, has not won elections for the capital since 2010.Since the beginning of the year more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in violence in South Sudan.South Sudan's civil war is entering its third year, with a new conflict erupting after Machar, in an interview with the AP published last month, blamed Kiir’s government and the army for the deaths, saying: “Our fight is one between the government and the people.”South Sudan's war has killed at least 2,000 people in South Sudan since August 2013, when Kiir sacked Vice President Riek Machar, accusing him of plotting a coup.Ahead of Machar's defection, Kiir had deployed soldiers in Bor as part of a military campaign to retake the city, which was in rebel hands for more than three years before it fell to government forces on August 15.The military has been attacking neighbourhoods and launching air raids to push back the rebel soldiers and police, but the government control of the capital is far from secure.The government's progress in Bor came a day after three of	0
President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda that requires "significant resources," even as he aims to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. President Obama says the United States will overcome its current economic ills while also taking on climate change."In order to create the economic growth that will create high-wage jobs and reduce the deficit, we have a clear choice," he said during a speech in Chicago. "The good news is that when the government focuses on helping people, it will unleash the power of American innovation to create millions of good jobs at home and a better future for our children and grandchildren."The comments followed a speech by Vice President Joe Biden. In it, Biden said the United States needs to become less dependent on other countries for trade and instead needs to grow its own trade sector."Our job isn't to play catch-up; our job is to catch up," Biden said."The United States is the world's largest creditor nation, and, like every creditor nation, we need to be sure that our debts are paid," he said. "[Our] challenge is no less about helping the rest of the world than it is about helping the American economy. And that's where the ideas we discuss today could become the seeds of a new era of American leadership."Here are the highlights of his speech to a joint session of congress:1. Economy, jobs, and a cleaner environmentObama said the United States needs to become "more competitive in the world by building our own capacity to respond to new challenges" such as "the spread of infectious diseases and climate change."He said there are also "growing needs" for healthcare and education that are "far more complex than we've ever faced."Obama's proposal for the economic stimulus package calls for an "entire new approach to rebuilding our infrastructure" and to "help us invest in research and development [that] will improve the quality of our lives.""This investment alone will create hundreds of thousands of good jobs," the president said.Obama said he intends to use existing tax and spending programs by encouraging businesses to invest in research and development and innovation. He said he will ask Congress to approve a stimulus package with $800 billion "to help us respond to the challenges of a changing climate."2.

The Hole in the Wall experiments, known as HiW, were first implemented in 1999, when a computer with an internet connection was embedded into a wall for children to discover and use unsupervised. The wall adjoined a slum in India. Only a month later, it was evident that the children had taught themselves to use the computer and also picked up some skills in English and mathematics. This kind of design was then set up in more and more remote areas across the nation with almost identical results. These were computers embedded in walls or kiosks in easily accessible and highly visible public spaces, facilitating peer interaction, discovery and learning in groups of children. We concluded that groups of children from disadvantaged and remote settings can learn to use computers and access internet resources, on their own, if given appropriate free, public and unsupervised access. Watch an interview with Sugata Mitra These earliest experiences also showed that children could develop some skills in English and mathematics. What came through unequivocally in this and further work on self-organizing systems in education was that groups of children -- irrespective of who or where they are, or what language they speak -- given free and public access to computers and the internet can: 1. Become computer-literate on their own -- that is, they can learn to use computers and the internet for most of the tasks done by lay users. 2. Teach themselves enough English to use e-mail, chat and search engines. 3. Learn in a few months to search the internet for answers to questions. 4. Improve their English pronunciation on their own. 5. Improve their mathematics and science scores in school. 6. Be prepared to pass examinations several years ahead of grade level. 7. Change their social interaction skills and value systems. 8. Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination. We then went on to show that the quality of traditional schooling declines the farther schools are from the urban center of New Delhi. A similar decline is visible in the UK as one goes to more economically disadvantaged areas. This has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas. TED.com: Bill Gates on mosquitoes, malaria and education Two landmark events took this work further. The first was a comment by the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke to me: "Teachers that can be replaced by a machine should be".	1
U.S. intelligence agencies believe Osama bin Laden is isolated from al Qaeda and spending much of his energy merely surviving, the head of the CIA said on Thursday. Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $25 million reward for his capture. CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency's priority. "He is putting a lot of energy into his own survival -- a lot of energy into his own security," Hayden said in a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington. "In fact, he appears to be largely isolated from the day-to-day operations of the organization he nominally heads," he said. In recent weeks, there have been several U.S. missile strikes by unmanned drones around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The United States maintains that Taliban and al Qaeda forces operate with relative impunity in tribal areas along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and use those areas as staging grounds to attack U.S. forces and their allies inside Afghanistan. Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies, but remains a threat. "Al Qaeda has suffered serious setbacks, but it remains a determined, adaptive enemy unlike any our nation has ever faced," Hayden said. "The war is far from over." Regardless of whether bin Laden is actively helping lead the terrorist organization, the CIA believes capturing or killing him would be a huge blow to al Qaeda, according to Hayden. "This is an organization that has never been through a change at the top," he said. "For 20 years, bin Laden has been the visionary, the inspiration or harmonizing force behind al Qaeda." Hayden said it remained to be seen whether bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, could maintain unity in the ranks without him. "The truth is, we simply don't know what would happen if bin Laden is killed or captured. But I'm willing to bet that whatever happens, it would work in our favor," Hayden said.	1
The fire that engulfed the Porsche carrying actor Paul Walker apparently did not erupt until a minute after the car clipped a light pole Saturday. That conclusion is based on security camera video obtained by CNN that shows black smoke starting to rise from the crash scene 60 seconds after it shows the light pole and a tree falling. Could Walker and the other occupant in the car have made it out in those 60 seconds? That's hard to tell. The two may have died on impact when the car struck the light pole. The answer might be clearer when the coroner's office releases its preliminary findings of the autopsies of the remains of two men -- presumed to be Walker and friend Roger Rodas, a coroner's officer said. The autopsies were completed Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Fred Corral said. But investigators have placed a "security hold" on  it for now. The coroner will not even disclose if the identities have been confirmed using dental X-rays.  Officially, the dead are only identified as case numbers. Corral did not give a reason for the secrecy, which can be requested by law enforcement agencies during an investigation.  It is often done in cases involving criminal probes, but there has been no indication this is anything more than a traffic accident investigation. The autopsies should be able to confirm whether Rodas, as witnesses reported, was behind the wheel with Walker in the passenger seat. Video  obtained by CNN Tuesday from a security camera posted on a building on the opposite side of the street from the crash does not show the Porsche Carerra GT crashing along a business park street in Valencia, California, Saturday afternoon. It does show the light pole and tree falling.  Smoke is faintly visible above the scene 60 seconds later, followed by a heavy plume of black smoke after two minutes. As investigators searched for more information about the accident that killed the popular "Fast & Furious" actor on Saturday, one of his co-stars dramatically addressed grieving fans. Using a police car's loudspeaker, actor Vin Diesel thanked a crowd of mourning fans, calling Walker an "angel up in Heaven." Every night since the crash fans have gathered and left mementos near the spot on a wide business park road in Valencia, California, about 30 miles north of Hollywood, according to Walker's publicist and CNN affiliate KCAL.	1
With the World Series on the line, radio stations in San Francisco aren't taking any chances. Starting Tuesday the San Francisco Giants will face off against the Kansas City Royals in baseball's championship series, and two local radio stations decided they'd send a message. "No offense, Lorde, but for the duration of the World Series, KFOG Radio will be a "Royals"-free zone," the radio station posted on it's Facebook page. "We're sure you understand." 7 reasons why Kansas City's a winner Lorde, the 17-year-old pop star from New Zealand, won a song of the year Grammy earlier this year for her No. 1 hit, "Royals." KOIT said its ban was prompted by listener complaints. "So @965KOIT banned the Lorde song Royals? That's awesome!" tweeted someone known as The Sassy PETIT. But not everyone thinks the ban rules. Louis Vargas opined on KFOG's Facebook page that the ban will make no difference in the series outcome, calling the move absurd. Tony Last complained that the song doesn't actually have "anything to do with the opposing team." Others commented that the lyrics actually seem to be anti-Royals. "We'll never be royals," Lorde sings. "It ddn't run in our blood." Still others, not caught up in the love affair, greeted the announcement with more of a shrug. "Isn't that song so last year?" commented Jennifer Farr Hutchison on KFOG's Facebook page. "Feel free to make that a permanent policy," wrote an apparent "Royals" hater. The Kiwi sensation may be banned in the Bay Area, but in Kansas City they're letting her rule their airwaves. Kansas City's 99.7 The Point put out a plans to play "Royals" at the top of every hour on the opening night of the World Series. "A few angry San Franciscans who don't have a song called 'Giants' won't rain on our parade," the station's program director is quoted as saying.	1
Barclays bank took out large UK newspaper ads Saturday to say sorry to "all Barclays customers and clients" in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal which has hammered its reputation. The public apology, printed in papers including the Financial Times and the Times of London and signed by outgoing chairman Marcus Agius, says the bank is "truly sorry for what has happened and that you have been let down." It continues: "It is our actions now over the coming months and years that will make the difference. "You are the lifeblood of our business, and we will not allow ourselves to be distracted from what really matters -- delivering for you, day in and day out." Barclays is determined to put its customers "at the heart of everything we do" and must earn the right to retain their business, the statement concludes. Agius's resignation as chairman was announced 12 days ago, as the scandal over the rates at which banks lend each other money gathered pace. He will step down once a replacement is found. Following wide pressure, the bank's former chief executive, Bob Diamond, resigned a day later. The scandal involves a lending rate, known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers' Association. The BBA publishes Libor as a result of this. The Libor affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates. A report from the UK's Financial Services Authority concluded the rate-fixing scandal was of the "utmost seriousness." Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities. E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. Diamond has blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of "a couple thousand." During the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, Barclays' high Libor postings came under scrutiny and the bank, concerned about "unfounded negative perceptions," lowered its Libor submissions, according to Barclays notes to the Treasury Committee.	1
Even a presidential campaign's airplane troubles can get partisan in an election year. Aviation incidents involving President Barack Obama and Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have inspired hundreds of supporters commenting at CNN.com to connect those events to the candidates' political positions. When the Air Force One pilot aborted his first landing in Toledo, Ohio, due to weather on Wednesday, commenters were quick to jump on Obama. "See, Barack Obama can't even land a plane correctly," wrote a commenter whose handle is TheOtherBob. "He was probably checking the polls - thinks he has Ohio in the bag - no need to land," wrote another commenter. "He was distracted, since he was busy adjusting gas prices over his smart phone," wrote another commenter. Ann Romney's smoke-filled plane Ann Romney couldn't catch a break, either. Her airplane cabin filling up with smoke due to an electrical problem was no laughing matter, but commenters quickly took aim at her husband and his response. Mitt Romney talked about not being able to open the airplane's windows in flight. (New York Times writer Ashley Parker, who wrote the presidential pool report mentioning the comments, declined to comment on his remarks, referring CNN to a New York magazine piece where she made it clear that Romney was joking.) "Maybe if Romney hadn't started the outsourcing trend, that plane would have been built and maintained better by hardworking 47%ers," wrote one commenter. "Firefighters came to the rescue, paramedics were there on time and the police took special care of your security. We are the 47% your husband scorns," wrote commenter Kweso. Reminders of the actual flying conditions Enough with the political bickering, suggested some commenters. "The hate thrown out at the Romneys (and at President Obama) is just plain absurd," wrote commenter jolivier23. On Romney's flight: "CAN YOU PEOPLE STOP WITH THIS CHARADE. Can you just be happy that the everyone was safe and no one was injured," wrote one commenter. "What is wrong with you people? Why are you making this a political issue? I am just glad nobody was hurt. " On Obama's flight: "This incident with the President was just routine turbulence which is something that you really can't do anything about in the first place," wrote one commenter.	1
For more than 20 years, the bulletproof museum case housed a small piece of yesteryear: a gold bar recovered from a sunken Spanish galleon. Today, its case is broken, littered with black fingerprint dust. The treasure is gone. Stolen. Two thieves were caught in the act by the museum's security cameras. "This is a special piece," said Melissa Kendrick, executive director of the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida. "All the pieces have an incredible historic value, but this is the piece that was shared with the public in a whole totally different way." It was different because visitors could touch it. By reaching into the specially designed display case, more than 6 million people have touched the 74.85-ounce bar, valued at more than $550,000. "They're touching something that belonged to someone in 1622," said Carol Shaughnessy, author of "Diving Into Glory." "Ordinarily people don't get to touch something like that. You can't touch an Egyptian mummy. This is a hands-on connection to history." But now, what does a thief do with a priceless, high-profile artifact? Is there an underground market that will pay $550,000 for this almost 400-year-old piece of solid gold? One expert says no. "That's why these crimes don't make a whole lot of money for the criminals," said Robert Wittman, a former FBI agent who once headed the FBI's Art Crime Team. "It doesn't make sense to do it." Wandering through the museum, the thieves can be seen in security video trying to open museum doors. The video is incredibly clear. First, they appeared to be targeting a display case of gold chains. Then, after a security guard left this part of the museum, a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum. "We're getting information and following leads," said Key West Police Chief Donie Lee. "Unfortunately we haven't got the best lead, which is, I know that person and we go out, and it's a positive ID, and we're able to go out and pick those guys up."	1
Half a million copies of a new children's book by President Barack Obama hit the shelves Tuesday. First daughters Sasha and Malia inspired the president to write "Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters," publisher Random House said. The publisher describes Obama's latest book as "a moving tribute to 13 groundbreaking Americans and the ideals that have shaped our nation -- from the artistry of Georgia O'Keeffe, to the courage of Jackie Robinson, to the patriotism of George Washington." The manuscript was completed before Obama took office in 2009, Random House said in a statement released in September. The book "celebrates the characteristics that unite all Americans -- the potential to pursue our dreams and forge our own paths," said Chip Gibson, head of the publisher's children's books division. Proceeds from the book, which has a suggested retail price of $17.99, will be donated to the Fisher House Foundation for a scholarship fund for children of fallen and disabled soldiers. The book includes illustrations by artist Loren Long, who also illustrated Madonna's 2003 children's book, "Mr. Peabody's Apples." "Fisher House Foundation is honored to be chosen as the recipient of the author's proceeds from President Obama's book 'Of Thee I Sing:  A Letter to My Daughters,'" said foundation chairman Ken Fisher. The cover illustration shows Sasha and Malia walking across a green lawn with their pet dog, Bo. Obama also wrote the international best-sellers "Dreams from My Father" and "The Audacity of Hope." He isn't the only White House resident to enter the children's book world. In 2008, HarperCollins released "Read All About It!" a book penned by former first lady Laura Bush and first daughter Jenna Bush.	1
A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity, New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday. FBI Director Robert Mueller  said authorities had "concluded their investigation and today we are releasing the results." The teenager, who has not been publicly identified, had been questioned by U.S. immigration officials about his presence in New Zealand, where he went on vacation in July. Investigators declined to give details on his nationality or country. However, the computer hacking scheme involved over 1 million computers in 74 countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia. Police said in a statement that they believed the teen, who had been staying at a tourist lodge with his family, was responsible for the cyber threats.In New Zealand, the teen was questioned by U.S. immigration authorities who suspected he was responsible for the cyber attacks and asked the teen to leave the country. The teenager was not arrested and remains in New Zealand, where he was expected to reside with his family. While in New Zealand, the teenager was questioned by authorities. "The New Zealand police were notified immediately after the incident and have investigated the matter thoroughly," the department said. A spokesman for U.S. law enforcement said authorities are cooperating with authorities in New Zealand "to investigate this matter further." "This type of crime is unacceptable and will not be tolerated," the spokesman said.New Zealand's prime ministry said officials were working to determine the teenager's full circumstances and what, if any, links he had to international computer attacks aimed at undermining security. The teen is the son of a man who had recently been detained on a child pornography charge. He posted a photo on Facebook of himself posing with his mother and other family. Police said they had traced the attack to a computer in the area of his apartment from which the cyber attack originated. Police said the teen is a British citizen who holds an Australian passport.The man said on Facebook that the boy, who is his son's friend, traveled to New Zealand to visit his parents and that he had been visiting the city of Christchurch for more than a month. His father, a resident of North Carolina, was a suspect in the case, a police spokesman said. A man who claimed to be a member of the son's family called police and asked them to return his son to the United States. The man refused comment, but the teen	0
Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry. Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents. Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years. His party made big gains in Congress. Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate. President Obama's got a mandate. And a majority. What's to stop him? Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done. The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government. They had just waged a revolution against a king. To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism. So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government. The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well. As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress. The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda. A minority of 41 senators can "filibuster'' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote. How many votes will Republicans have in the Senate? 41 or 42, depending on the outcome in Minnesota where ballots are still being counted. Presidents often have problems holding their own party together. That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests. American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs. They are not foot-soldiers of a party. When Bill Clinton first became president, he had a solid Democratic majority in Congress. But he could not get his health care reform plan passed. After an intense advertising campaign by opponents, many Americans were worried that the Clintons were planning a government takeover of the health care system. The Clinton plan failed, and within two years, Democrats lost their majority in Congress. One-party control didn't work any better for George W. Bush. Bush had trouble getting what he wanted -- notably, immigration reform -- from a Republican Congress. Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006. But here's another dirty little secret of American government: it often does work. Very well in fact.	1
Giant rocks came tumbling down a snowy Colorado mountainside early Monday, punching gaping holes in the interstate below, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The rock slide at Glenwood Canyon halted travel on Interstate 70 between Glenwood Springs and Dotsero, about 18 miles east, according to the department. Glenwood Springs is about 120 miles west of Denver. It is unclear when construction crews will complete enough work to open at least part of the roadway. About 20 boulders struck the interstate shortly after midnight, the transportation department said. They ranged from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter, with the largest weighing an estimated 66 tons, the department said on its Web site. About eight holes or dips were left on the interstate. Road underwiring was exposed and rock crumbles surrounded the damage, the department said. The largest hole measured 20 feet by 10 feet -- bigger than a full-size SUV. Rocks were scattered over a 100-yard stretch of the road. A steel guard rail and median barrier were also damaged. The damage resembles a major rock slide in the area back in 2004, the department said.	1
One of America's pre-eminent political power couples made a rare joint appearance Friday, when Bill and Hillary Clinton took the stage at the former president's Clinton Global Initiative conference. Bill Clinton says his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the "best public service our family has ever produced." "I want to begin by expressing my extreme indebtedness to the Clinton Global Initiative, to all of you who participated, for giving me the first chance I have had in a week to see Hillary," Bill Clinton told the audience of social activists and business leaders at the closing session of CGI, a week-long conference designed to find solutions to global problems through public and private partnerships. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was at the session to unveil a new State Department initiative on food security. As he introduced her, the former president was effusive in his praise for his wife, saying that her approach to food security -- helping farmers around the world grow their own food to earn income and alleviate poverty -- was much smarter than the decades-long policy of simply giving humanitarian aid and food to countries.  Watch Clinton pay tribute to his wife » "It was a wrong-headed policy. It persisted through Democratic and Republican policies alike, including mine. We were all wrong, and she is determined to reverse it," Bill Clinton said.  Watch portion of Anderson Cooper's interview with former President Clinton » "Most of what I know about what I do today, I learned from her and she has become the best public servant our family has produced," he added. "I am very proud of her and honored that she came here." Hillary Clinton, who received a standing ovation, had equally kind words for her husband. "It won't surprise you to hear that I am very proud of my husband, and I think what he has invented and brought to life here is extraordinary," she said, adding that the new State Department food initiative, in part, was an idea she developed by seeing the kinds of partnerships the Clinton Global Initiative produced. The Clintons posed for a photo-op with State Department officials and executives from General Mills and other organizations, who pledged at the conference to start a program to help farmers around the world. And then, for fans of the former first couple, a rare treat. As she walked off the stage, Bill Clinton drew some more cheers when he gave his wife a kiss.	1
Rory McIlroy capped off a remarkable year by being named as the PGA Tour Player of the Year. The 23-year-old is the youngest player to win the trophy, named after  the great Sam Snead.Here are a few things you may not know about this young guns:He plays golf with both his sistersMcIlroy spent part of 2013 playing with his two youngest sisters."I think the fact that my sisters are girls has been the greatest influence on me in life," McIlroy told Golf Channel in an interview after the awards dinner in September. "I've just tried to be a good role model, and show the girls how I live my life."He loves McDonald'sMcIlroy's love of fast food doesn't end with burgers and cheeseburgers. In March, McIlroy flew to Texas for a photo shoot with the popular fast food chain.

No, not all men channel frustration over romantic rejection into a killing spree. But yes, all women experience harassment, discrimination or worse at some point in their lives. That's the message at the core of an ongoing Twitter conversation that emerged after a rampage last week that left six students from the University of California, Santa Barbara, dead and wounded 13 others. Elliot Rodger, who apparently shot and killed himself, left behind a robust digital footprint detailing his plan to "destroy everything I cannot have," blaming the "cruelness of women" for leading to his "day of retribution." His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what "women must fear" even if "not all men" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday. The person did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The hashtag -- a response to the "not all men" defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on Twitter, zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman's worth is based on her availability to men. By Tuesday morning, #YesAllWomen had been tweeted more than 1 million times. Expanding the conversation #YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House. While most feminist-driven Twitter campaigns preach to the choir, #YesAllWomen has succeeded in drawing the mainstream -- including men -- into the conversation, feminist writer and political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said. More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence. There was backlash to the hashtag's sentiment, too. Some challenged the idea that misogyny was behind Rodger's killing spree, while others argued against the broader idea that most women face gender-based harassment. But those tweeting #YesAllWomen interpreted backlash as evidence to prove their points.	1
The NBA is without a Chinese-born player for the first time in 12 years, after it was announced Yi Jianlian has signed a one-year deal in  with the Toronto Raptors. The 34-year-old forward, who played his entire 14-year professional career in China, now joins the franchise after two seasons with the Sacramento Kings. In addition to his seven-year career, Jianlian spent the 2009–2011 seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers (as well as the Sacramento Kings before being waived late last season) and averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.Prior to his stint with the Kings, Jianlian spent the past few years with Beijing Ducks in China. In Beijing, he averaged 21.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.4 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game over 40 games as an all-around contributor for the Chinese club.While in Beijing, he scored the Chinese League's first-ever triple-double, and he has also contributed in an array of other statistical categories, including 3.5 blocks per game, 1.7 steals per game, and 9.3 points per game.Yilong Jianlian attended Boston University and holds a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. The forward played for the Boston Celtics from 2005 to 2011 and signed with the Portland Trail Blazers in Summer 2012.The Raptors are also without a Chinese-born player as well, as the Toronto native Raymond Ridulph has been cut by the team and will return to Europe later in the year. Ridulph was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the NBA's 2003 D-League Draft. He played in 24 games for the Raptors and averaged 5.8 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists. While in the NBA, Ridulph scored at least 18 points 17 times, including six games with 20 or more points.In early February, the Raptors and the NBA announced that Yi Jianlian will play basketball in Toronto in a new partnership. Following the NBA's decision last October to cancel the free agent signings, in which the two sides agreed to a one-player deal, the Raptors have made the decision to give Yi an opportunity to earn a full-time starting role. “We are extremely excited to welcome Yi Jianlian to the Raptors family and to be	0
If the threat of underwear bombs became known last Christmas, why did airport screeners only recently begin aggressively checking for them? The answer is two-fold, Transportation Security Administration Director John Pistole told reporters Tuesday. For one, the TSA had been checking for explosives since the mid-1960s, and that history hadn’t been disturbed. In addition, there is the fact that most underwear bombs are plastic – and plastic explosives have a hard time passing through security.“When I say underwear bombs, I mean things that explode inside your body,” Pistole said. The TSA has a new screening system that uses machine-readable bar codes to look for explosive material in undergarments, but Pistole says that as of now, his agency hasn’t yet been involved in any underwear-bomb incidents. There have been some recent attacks using explosive devices to kill or maim people dressed as Santa Claus, but most of these were hoaxes to impress children, and the TSA doesn’t have any reason to believe that someone would attempt an underwear bomb. The biggest danger to planes has always been airport terrorists who actually get on board with explosive devices. The TSA has developed new technology that can scan passengers for bombs without opening their coats or shirts to look for explosives. Pistole said he has seen that device go through the first test flight at one of the agency’s airports, and he said that in terms of the safety of flying, that technology is still years away. So, at the moment, the TSA says that underwear-bomb incidents can be minimized by screening the people who actually fit the criteria, and not everyone who may fit that criteria might be a potential underwear bomb. “The problem is that there are people who look like this, but who are not,” Pistole said.Bengali: বাংলাদেরিয়াত যতটা হারপাতির টাকা যেমনটা চাইর তারিখটি দর	0
A high-speed passenger train left its tracks on the outskirts of  Paris, killing at least 37 people and injuring more than 200,  leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.It was the deadliest train disaster in French history and the second-deadliest since a huge explosion in a tunnel of the Alpes-Maritimes department on August 22, 1992, when at least 73 people died and 120 were injured.The accident, which involved an express train, had investigators from the National Railway Authority  asking for help from France's Civil Protection agency Thursday.A statement from NRCA, the French national railroad, said the first stop at Rennes-les-Bains, a town northeast of Paris, was "the most hazardous" at the moment with one fatality and more than 100 injured.The French network operator said: "The train was making a fast speed of 250 kilometers (155 mi) per hour at the time of the accident."The spokesman added: "It is difficult to say why a freight train came to a stop on the tracks as there are no signs. There is heavy traffic on the route where the accident occurred."In an audio message played on a public address system, passengers at the scene said that the train was slowing to a crawl with 40-50 people aboard and was approaching a station.When the driver asked passengers to turn off their cellphones, some passengers replied with the voice of the conductor telling them: "Don't be so selfish."'People were dying'The conductor told an angry group of passengers at the scene that he tried to do everything he could during the accident and said: "Please, do not disturb your friends."Passengers, he said, were "dying."Passenger Alain Guel, who was on the train, said his father was killed by the blast and that people were dying as the train was rolling past the scene with his mother and sister inside."I saw people falling down and people dying," Alain Guel told French television station BFM. "They couldn't get into lifeboats, they were being thrown out of the train."The French rail minister blamed "systematic errors" for the accident."Our train was going at an incredible speed," Michel Richard, the minister of transport, said after the accident	0
Ah, London. Theater. Art. Fashion. Shopping. Nightlife. Meals you'll never forget (and that can be meant, now, in a good way.) Is there anything she doesn't do superlatively? Like every glittering metropolis, however, it can be easy to miss the highlights amid all the noise and haste. This mini-guide is filled with the information you need to get in and out of London while impressing the clients and co-workers and still having time to eat royally, take jealousy-inducing pictures and pick up the kinds of souvenirs the folks back home will actually keep. Fastest airport transport London has several international airports and all are serviced by public transportation into central London in around an hour and a half. But why struggle on and off trains with luggage if you don't have to? By far the most comfortable way to get from the airport into the city is by using a car service. One of the most reliable local services is Addison Lee. The company says it can get you into central London from Heathrow in 45 minutes ($72) and from Gatwick in an hour and 20 minutes ($111).

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dominates almost any room he enters but is suddenly facing questions about his relevance in the 2016 presidential race. The surprisingly fast-moving Republican presidential contest, icky as it is, has moved at warp speed in recent months, and Christie continues to dominate it.It's not easy to be the governor of this state that he is, with a New York-viable, two-term advantage in statewide elections and a highly engaged base of social conservatives known as the Christian Coalition.But, even by the standards of a governor whose job often includes leading a major party's national effort, Christie has been able to do it.New Jersey is a must-win state in the fall, with a sizable and influential Latino electorate, as well as an African-American population and a growing young population. But that's not a large enough number to sustain a successful run, especially in 2016, and the prospects of a Christie run were at an all-time low before he endorsed Donald Trump last year.His allies, in and out of government, argue that there is no way that the Republican Party will settle for Christie's fourth term if Trump wins the nomination, so they think he must run for the party's nomination to salvage the party's chances, even if the primary is a long shot."We've got to keep Christie in the race," said one GOP strategist who is close to Christie."I don't know why the Republican establishment won't pick up the phone and speak to Chris and get his endorsement," said Christie's national co-chairman, Chris Christie, who is now the campaign's national co-chairman. "There's no reason for the Republican governors association to pick up the phone."I think he'd be a very strong candidate. I think it'd be a very difficult time for either of them to make it to the Republican convention and be considered a serious candidate, which is what Christie should be."The decision to endorse Trump has made Christie the most prominent Republican in the country whose support could help Trump achieve the nomination, but Christie has never run for president in his political career. And, the reality is that in most of the other states where he would have to win the primary, he is more likely to face a tough choice between supporting Hillary Clinton or supporting John McCain in the general election."This is a huge responsibility," said Christie,	0
but one would not expect it to boost the work of an 18th century writer. In France, and especially in Paris, the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued, but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths.  >  The death of the Pope has also been a source of some controversy in the Vatican. In a country where the Pope is still widely regarded as the spiritual leader of Catholicism, the public display of grief has been met by angry opposition from some Catholics.  >  The Pope's death has also prompted questions about his successor. The Vatican's news agency, the Vatican website, said the Pope had chosen Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger as his successor, but a source close to the Vatican said the Pope would not name a new leader until the next conclave. The Vatican has said that Pope Benedict XVI had been in good health.  >  In Spain, the Pope has for many years been a hero to the left wing, but today protests over a new law allowing gay couples to marry provoked a wave of support for the the Catholic Church. The law was opposed by the country's right-wing government, which said it did not respect religious values.  >  In the same way, the death of the head of the Catholic Church has caused concern for those who see the church as too tied up in its own internal politics.  >  In Poland, where the church is deeply involved in politics and has played an important role in the nation's independence and democracy, the Pope's death has become a symbol of the nation's transition from communism into democracy. The change to a more pluralistic society has created a vacuum among churches, but Catholic organisations are trying to fill that vacuum by appealing to Polish nationalism.  >  In Italy, the Pope's death has been a cause of both celebration and anger. Celebrations include the publication of the Pope's first encyclical, on the environment, and the appearance on the balcony of the Pope's plane. Some Catholic bloggers say the Pope's plane appeared with a papal banner reading 'Benedict XIV – The Pope That Nobody Knows'.  >  In China, where the Pope was the first Asian leader to visit the United States, the national mourning for the Pope has been tempered with the arrival of a delegation from the Church. The delegation had arrived in China on Saturday to ask for forgiveness for the persecution of Christians	0
Were nine attractive young Turkish women duped and imprisoned in a villa by Internet soft-core porn peddlers? Or did they simply call in the police to help them break their contract with an Internet contest similar to the reality TV show "Big Brother"? A lawyer for the production company, Istanbul Group Electronic Trade Communications and Advertising A.S., is arguing the latter. In a written statement on the company's Web site, Hilmi Tufan Cakir denied reports published in the Turkish and international media, that nine women were trapped against their will in an Istanbul villa, while cameras sold their images on the Internet. "My client organized a contest with reward money, contracts were signed with the contestant girls," the lawyer's statement said. "In accordance with the contracts signed by the nine girls, this contest was to be broadcast on the Internet live." But on Friday, an officer with a Turkish gendarme unit, told CNN that security forces raided the reality show's villa earlier this week, after they received a complaint. "We detained one person," said the gendarme officer, who asked not to be identified. "There were eight or nine young girls, some younger then 18, who were returned to their families." Turkish television showed footage of gendarme officers raiding the villa and detaining a suspect earlier this week. The disputed Web-site is a page of hot pink graphics and photos of scantily clad young women, accompanied by throbbing dance music and the title, "We Are at Home." It shows video of the villa and its pool, and flashes photos of the nine female "contestants" as well as a list of ratings for viewers, who can vote for their favorite lady via cell phone text message. Audience members were also encouraged to send "virtual gifts" to the contestants, like pink panties, beer, chocolate and a pearl necklace. Each resident of the house had their own introductory video. The women, dressed in mini-skirts and bikinis, pose by the villa's pool, dance around in revealing outfits, and introduce themselves to the camera. In one segment, a hostess named Zeynep Karacan, who wears a long dress with a plunging neck line, reads from cue cards, introduces viewers to the house and its residents, who enter one-by-one waving to the camera and carrying luggage.	1
Saudi Arabia's crown prince was convalescing Saturday in Morocco where he arrived this week after surgery for an undisclosed illness in New York City, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, right, seen in a 2007 file photo Crown Prince Sultan, who is also the nation's deputy prime minister, completed "all medical tests and treatments in the aftermath of the medical surgery he has previously undergone," the news agency said, quoting a statement from the Royal Court. Sultan arrived in the Moroccan city of Agadir on Wednesday, the press agency said. Speculation about his health has been mounting since he arrived in New York in February. While Saudi officials maintain publicly that Sultan's health has improved, the appointment in late March of a second deputy prime minister has raised more questions about the extent of his illness. Last month, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah issued a royal decree naming the interior minister, Prince Nayef -- the powerful brother of the crown prince and half-brother to the king -- to the post of second deputy prime minster. The appointment appears to mean Nayef is now the country's crown prince in waiting and second in line to be king. In recent weeks, local media have quoted Nayef as downplaying rumors that the crown prince may be seriously ill. "I would like to assure you that the crown prince's health is very good," he told reporters in March, according to the English-language daily newspaper Arab News. "God willing, after the medical vacation he will return to the kingdom in full health."	1
The tragic death of President Lech Kaczynski and Poland's political and military elite among the trees of the Katyn Forest is surreal, given that in those same woods, thousands of Polish prisoners of war were murdered by  the Germans in the Second World War. I'll explain.The Katyn Forest is roughly 2,400 square-kilometers in western Poland. Originally named after the village of Katyn near Kharkov in Ukraine, it was discovered in 1945 by a German army unit in Polish territory on the Russian border. They came upon a forest of wooden trees, apparently burned down by the Soviets. The Germans began removing the wood. The soldiers found an old mine, supposedly buried during World War II, containing several thousand Polish prisoners of war.The Katyn prisoners, the Soviet and German soldiers, and the Polish soldiers who had fled to the forest were murdered. The Russian Red Army used Soviet and German warplanes to drop leaflets over parts of Poland and the Soviet Union to warn of an impending attack, but the Soviet Union refused to provide air or ground support, and the Germans used the forest as a staging ground for attacking Poland.The Katyn massacre is regarded as a crime against humanity by some contemporary critics. It has been described as one of the most inhumane crimes in human history, and it was the inspiration for Albert Camus' famous novel The Plague. Many other novels and short stories have been written in the last two decades about the Polish prisoners. The best known among them is Kazimierz Kellman's Death Dealer.On January 22 of this year, the world media and the internet were transfixed by the death of Lech Kaczynski, a Polish leader of the Law and Justice Party, whose assassination in retaliation for the election victory of Donald Trump shocked many observers. There followed a media frenzy on the murder of the Polish leader, and the many other stories about his death, which generated a torrent of emotions and speculation.There are some who believe that the assassination of the Polish leader was orchestrated by Russia, or by the US. I believe there's a lot of truth in each of these theories, though we'll leave that debate for another time.The man who orchestrated the assassination of Lech and his political party is believed to be the current Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. In the days before the murder, the US, the Russian Federation, and the Polish government	0
Crowds of mourners gathered Sunday to bury a young man in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir after clashes the previous day between Kurdish protesters and Turkish security forces turned deadly. A member of Ârgütü'nden, an organization of Kurds in Turkey's southeast, told The Associated Press by telephone that two people were killed and more than 40 people were wounded by tear gas canisters fired by Turkish riot police. The group also said that one person died from a suspected coup d'etat plot.Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told parliament Sunday that "a group of terrorists" had carried out the July 15 failed coup, which left 251 people dead. He warned that "this can happen again," if people did not support democracy and "no one will be safe."He said he would seek to implement a new law to strengthen presidential powers, which critics say is a thinly-veiled plan to remove parliamentary oversight by giving Erdogan the power to issue decrees without the approval of parliament. The Associated Press and the Turkish news agency NTV later reported that Erdogan had issued a decree ordering the police and military to investigate and arrest people they suspect of being linked to the plot.The decree is the latest in the government's crackdown after the coup.At least 2,100 people have been detained and more than 300 have been put on trial in a series of anti-coup trials in Turkey. Thousands more have been detained after a purge of pro-Kurdish ministers, top prosecutors, judges, academics and businesspeople over the past two years.Turkey's government was still reeling from the unrest that erupted in Diyarbakir late Thursday after tens of thousands of people protested against the ruling party and its decision to cut off the main highway leading into the city.According to local officials, Turkish riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators and protesters in the eastern Turkish city, leaving scores injured.Protesters later clashed with police and set fire to the city's main prosecutor's office.The Diyarbakir protests came in the wake of the conviction last month of nearly 300 people accused by the government of plotting the failed 15 July 2016 coup. More than half of those prisoners are Kurdish supporters. The verdicts infuriated the Kurds, who say the government is targeting them because of their support for the country's powerful pro-Kurdish	0
Brooke Mueller has reconsidered her decision to undergo at-home drug rehab. Instead, Charlie Sheen's ex-wife has checked into an in-patient treatment center, her spokesman said Tuesday. Mueller was arrested in Aspen, Colorado, on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said. Mueller's publicist told CNN Monday that she would "take a different approach to deal with her addiction" with a daytime rehab program and around-the-clock supervision at home. "After further reflection and consideration, Brooke has decided to remove herself from the media spotlight and has entered a long-term in-patient treatment center where she can focus on her recovery without distraction," spokesman Steve Honig said Tuesday. Mueller, 34, checked into the rehab facility before the announcement was made, he said. "Brooke's goal is to maintain her sobriety and she believes this is the best option to reach that goal," Honig said. The 2-year-old twin sons she shares with Sheen "will remain in their home and familiar surroundings and be under the care of their longtime nanny," he said. "Charlie and Brooke's parents fully support her decision and everyone recognizes the importance of maintaining the children's normal routine," he said. The incidents in Aspen began when a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue there -- complained that Mueller had been "the aggressor" in an assault, Aspen police said. Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, police said. She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. She was released after posting an $11,000 bond, Aspen police said. A court date is scheduled for Monday. Mueller has appeared as an actress in several movies, including 2004's "A Love Song for Bobby Long," according to IMDb. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen. The twin sons and Mueller were part of Sheen's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network's "Two and Half Men."	1
Wow, Canada, you really, really love Taylor Swift. According to Entertainmentwise.com, "Track 3" from her new album, "1989," shot to No. 1 on iTunes in Canada after it was released. The only problem was, the release was an accident, as the track is eight seconds of white noise. 5 reasons you love Taylor Swift ... even if you don't want to The track was eventually removed. The singer's latest project, one of the year's most eagerly awaited albums, is set for release in the U.S. on October 27. A song cowritten with fun.'s Jack Antonoff called "Out of the Woods" was released last week, and it skyrocketed to No. 1. Swift recently told Esquire that she's moved to New York and is focusing on work and enjoying her life, including being surrounded by a great group of girlfriends. She said she refuses to be part of what she sees as "the takedown culture" surrounding celebrities. "You have celebrities who are pushed to the brink of a public meltdown, and so the public thinks that every person in the public eye has dirty secrets that they're keeping, or isn't what they seem, or is masking it and faking sincerity, faking authenticity, faking being surprised at award shows when you win a Grammy," she said.	1
A political group of gay conservatives will begin airing ads against a handful of Democratic candidates on Monday, including a spot against Ã¢ÂÂTroy Ã¢ÂÂ a candidate who has a record of wanting to reduce funding for LGBT initiatives.Ã¢ÂÂThe ads will all air over the same day and in the same time slot, but with slightly different messaging, as part of a campaign “to combat the increasingly corrupting influence of corporate money on politics,” according to the group, Americans for Responsible Leadership.The ad, which has been running for about a month, is the most aggressive action yet by the group, which says it’s not planning to endorse any candidate in the Democratic primary. Instead, the group is focused on defeating those three candidates, and two others who are “unacceptable to us.”The ad will go out against Sen. Brian Schatz, Rep. John Delaney, and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.The group also says they would like to see Rep. Dan Kildee, who is openly gay, as their candidate.Kildee is currently running against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, who has faced pressure before from gay groups. The groups have included the Human Rights Campaign, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, Project 21, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.Americans for Responsible Leadership, which does not identify itself as a political group, says in a press release that the “current level of corporate influence on our country’s politics is unprecedented in human history and threatens democratic values, and it’s at least partly to blame for Washington’s decline.”The group has begun work on an ad against the candidates.Kildee called on gay voters in Iowa, who had previously supported him, to support him again after realizing his LGBT voting record was a major reason their candidate’s campaign was struggling. He was the first gay lawmaker to win elective office, and was elected in 2006.Kildee is running against Kirkpatrick in an open seat, and he has not yet said if he will seek a third term in the Senate.The group’s ad is part of a larger effort by Americans for Respons	0
People would say, 'Oh, what's wrong with your golf, what's going on with your golf?' and I thought, it's not golf, it's my head. It's me." When Lindsey Wright spoke after the opening round of the women's  US Senior Open in New York, she told the press that she felt her game had been on the decline for months, that she had been "in the doldrums", and that she had been "totally out of practice" in her preparation.Wright's game was back to normal before the US Open, when she shot a 72 on Friday in the opening round. "I was definitely playing better the last couple of rounds," she said after her round. "I've been in great form these past couple of weeks."Wright's back condition meant that her plans to compete in the tournament were put on hold, however, by the USGA, and she did not have time to practise with the US team and prepare for the tournament. "I don't think I would've been able to do what I've been able to do over the last few weeks if I was going into the US Open feeling 100 percent fit," she said. "It's been such a blessing to have the opportunity that I have because I don't know what to expect."The US Open will be the first women's major event she will compete in since the 1999 US Open. "I've missed it so much," Wright said. "It means a lot to me to be here and having the opportunity to compete in a major for the first time in what feels like forever."Wright was asked by the press after the US Open how she would feel if she succeeded in having a major victory but did not win the US Open. "I would be fine with that, but you know what I mean. I just want to win the tournament," she said. "You know, I think for me, if we ever get to that point, I think it's a different level from this tournament. I think it's different from playing with the US team."In addition, the US team was playing at the Open Championship, held in England, on the weekend before the US Open but not on the main USGA schedule, meaning the team could not travel to the US Open with the US team.I think I'd be proud to represent the US in a major even if	0
A top European Union official said Saturday that new sanctions will be proposed within a week against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, but  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko sounded like he can't wait that long. "I think we are very close to  (the imposition of) new sanctions. The only thing is that the deadline for new sanctions will be in about a week.

It was one of those behind-the-scenes moments that a reporter covering the Tea Party rarely gets to witness. About 1:35 a.m. Thursday, a man ran up to a Tea Party Express bus, approaching from the left, waving his arms and shouting something that none of us on the bus could understand. I was sitting in the "sidekick seat," a leather perch near the driver with a clear view. The three-bus caravan had just rolled into Washington, hours ahead of the final rally of the "Just Vote them Out" tour -- the movement's third national event since coming together a little over a year ago. The bus I was on carried about 14 weary travelers: Tea Party leaders and activists, journalists and Casey the dog, a small girl with floppy ears belonging to Tea Party Express Chairman Mark Williams. We had just arrived after a grueling trip from Boston, Massachusetts, where Sarah Palin rallied a crowd of thousands on Boston Common, and were blocks away from our destination. The bus was hard to miss, wrapped full-on in a Tea Party advertisement. Apparently, just the sight of it made the man angry. As he rushed us, shouting all the way, the bus driver cautiously slid open his window. "This country is at war," the man screamed into the slightly opened window. The driver quickly slammed it shut. No one on the bus, including me, could understand what point the man was trying to make. The activists dismissed him as a drunk. But one thing was very clear: The Tea Party had once again attracted attention from one of its many critics. In fact, the Tea Party movement has earned plenty of detractors as it has traveled cross-country labeling President Obama a "socialist" and blasting what it says is big government run amok, while invoking the Constitution's sanctity. Agitators have thrown eggs at the buses. Ray March, one of the drivers, told me that a semi-truck driver tried to run his bus off the road. Now there was a late-night ranting as the conservative activists rolled into the nation's reliably liberal capital. On the drive to Washington, the activists had aimed their ire at cable news channels, news sites or blogs they felt were biased against the Tea Party movement. They praised outlets they felt cast the movement in its right light. From what I saw, the bus' TV system was tuned to one news outlet in particular. Hint: It wasn't CNN.	1
It feels like a rerun of the Orange Revolution. Similar to late 2004 when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest what they saw as a fraudulent presidential election, mass ills in Ukraine that are now being made more widely known by the world include rampant corruption and a general sense of desperation. After months of protests and political upheaval, the opposition movement known as Euromaidan is currently seeking to topple the president, Viktor Yanukovych, by force of government force, and this is happening amid an international outcry over the fact that one of Russia's strongest allies in international affairs, Yanukovych, has been forced out of office and his regime is being seen as being at the core of the ongoing instability. Yanukovych's fall is a direct result of his attempts to reach a deal with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, in late January 2014 on the future of Ukraine, and when Putin told Yanukovych not to pull out of the agreement, Yanukovych fell. From the outside, Yanukovych's fall at a time of worldwide economic downturn looks like a tragic example, but from the inside of Ukrainian institutions, it is turning out to be a golden opportunity.Advertisement:When Russian and Ukrainian leaders met in Minsk last week -- a long-simmering dispute from the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s which continues because of Ukraine's strategic position on the EU, NATO and the US-led Western Security Council -- Russia demanded of Ukraine that it respect the terms of the agreement reached in December 2010 between the two countries. Ukraine's failure to meet the terms of that agreement, and its refusal to respect the Minsk agreement, have now led to a situation where a Russian puppet regime of Yanukovych is now dictating Ukraine's foreign policy. As far as Putin is concerned, Yanukovych is an enemy who broke international law by pulling out of the agreement. A Ukrainian parliament speaker who has met with Russian envoy Sergey Lavrov over the last week has told him that Ukraine will not follow Russia's demands. Yanukovych has been forced out of office and now finds himself on the side of the opposition.As we watch this situation unfold, it becomes abundantly clear that Yanukovych is not the true villain, or even the principal villain. In fact, the West's role in the whole debacle has been to make it seem like Yanukovych is the villain, to the point where his resignation by way of a resignation speech has led many Western media outlets to declare Yanukovych the legitimate president over the opposition who has been trying	0
Four U.N. peacekeepers were released Sunday, five days after they were seized by armed men while patrolling between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an army official from the Philippines said. Maj. Ramon Zagala, a spokesman for the Philippine Armed Forces, said the Filipino peacekeepers were with the commander of that country's troops in the Golan Heights. "Last week was a challenge and we are very thankful for their safe release," Zagala said. He said he could not provide an update on their health. They will return to Camp Ziouani, where doctors will examine them. According to the U.N. news website, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a statement thanking the government of Qatar for its role in the safe release of the hostages. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force monitors the area in accordance with the 1974 agreement between Syria and Israel negotiated after the Yom Kippur War. In March, 22 peacekeepers were held for four days by rebels. The U.N. called on Syrian and rebel troops at that time to honor the impartiality of the U.N. troops. Tensions in the area have been heightened recently and Israel conducted strikes against Syria twice. The attacks, confirmed by a U.S. official last week, targeted a weapons storage site containing missiles and a Damascus research facility. The official stressed that Israel is concerned about Syria transferring weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.	1
They've been called "bromances": those buddy films and TV shows, such as the movies "Pineapple Express" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," that feature non-sexual but deep friendships between two or more males.  Bromance is now an American-English word derived from the French "bromance" and the British slang word "bomby."Etymology Before the word bromance became the American-English synonym of the word buddy, its origin was from the French "bromance". French bromance, is a compound word based on the prefix Brom + the suffix -ance (conjunctive, meaning "together, together, together"). The French word "bromance" can be literally translated as "bromantic friendship, bond of friendship". In English, the French word "bromance" was a compound word formed by using the prefix Brom + the French suffix -ance, meaning "bond, association, relation". However, the prefix Brom + the French suffix -ance was only added to French-language words where the etymology of a word was already found. In this case, it is the case with the word "bromance" in English. The first time in English that the prefix Brom + the French suffix -ance is used as a standalone word was in 1957, by J. P. McGlothlin when he wrote "New York, New York" (using both the French and the American-English words "New York" in the song). The word "bromance" or "bromantic friendship" was first used in 1965 by English singer and poet Bertram Turecamo in his song "We Belong to Each Other" and was included on his 1965 album, "Bertram Turecamo."  The word "bromance" literally means "bond of the heart" and refers to those people or characters who take it upon themselves to care for and assist their fellow man. Bromance is a social term, meaning that two people are very close friends and, in a negative way, those that would be considered as enemies. Bromance has no sexual connotation, it has a more positive social connotation. Bromance is used when referring to a strong friendship between two people who are so close and close that they are willing to sacrifice, or give up their own dreams, happiness, and well-being	0
Editor's note: The following story, based on testimony in Phillip Garrido's trial for a 1976 kidnapping, contains some sexually explicit material. Phillip Garrido is show in an early mug shot taken in connection           with his 1976 arrest.In the spring of 1976 -- one year after the murder of Patty Hearst in San Francisco, the kidnapping of an Arizona couple and the disappearance of a teenage girl in Chicago -- a California businessman named Phillip Garrido looked up one of the most memorable names in crime: Al Capone."So, you know, I had to have a look at that guy," he says. "It had to be the guy who took down Al Capone."It was in that spring that a 27-year-old young man named Carl Douglas met the man who would come to be known as Capone. The two men had similar backgrounds. Garrido, whose father owned a lumber company, had grown up in the city of San Leandro. Douglas, who grew up in a rural section of Arizona, was from the small town of Stroudsburg.But where their paths crossed was different. Douglas was a career criminal who had started life in San Leandro as a farmhand. He'd worked his way up but had gotten into trouble for armed robbery, a burglary and a drug charge. By the time he was 19, he had graduated to bank robbery and a series of holdups. He was sentenced to three years in the California prison system.In 1952, he wound up in San Quentin prison. He met his wife there but was expelled after she got pregnant. He married again and moved to Yuma and a series of jobs that took him to California. Eventually, he came to L.A. where he worked as a painter. In the mid-1960s, an old girlfriend suggested he try a life of crime. He took the advice and was arrested for bank robbery. At the time, he had no convictions."He started to get into this thing, he was like," Garrido says. "I think the word he used was 'fooled into it by the system.'"For all their differences, Douglas and Garrido were drawn back together after prison. After Douglas' release in 1965, Garrido got a job at a local bank. That job led to another job with the city of L.A. Water	0
The cause of a mysterious illness that has claimed the lives of more than 60 Cambodian children has been determined, medical doctors familiar with the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. A combination of pathogens, disease-causing micro-organisms, is to blame for the illness, the World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health, has concluded, the doctors said. The pathogens include enterovirus 71, which is known to cause neurological disease; streptococcus suis, which can cause infections like bacterial meningitis in people who have close contact with pigs or with pork products; and dengue, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The inappropriate use of steroids, which can suppress the immune system, worsened the illness in a majority of the patients, the doctors said. The World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to advise health care workers to refrain from using steroids in patients with signs and symptoms of the infection, which include severe fever, encephalitis and breathing difficulties. While not all the microorganisms were present in each patient, doctors concluded the illness was caused by a combination of them and worsened by steroid use. The WHO sources did not want to be identified because the results of the health organization's investigation have not yet been made public. "I'm very confident for the reason of the epidemic," said Dr. Phillipe Buchy, chief of virology at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and one of the doctors who cracked the case. "The first thing that goes through your mind is, is this one of the usual suspects you haven't detected before?" said Dr. Arnaud Tarantola, chief of epidemiology and public health at the Institut Pasteur. "If it is, has it mutated, or changed in a way that it causes more severe disease? Or is it something completely new?" On the steroids issue, Tarantola said, "When you have a dying child, you try to use what you have at hand, and they were right to try that." But, he acknowledged, "from the cases we reviewed, almost all of the children died, and almost all of them had steroids." Parents face anxious wait over mystery illness	1
Before a deadly fire that burned a home in Annapolis, Maryland, technology executive Don Pyle and his wife, Sandra, spent a day with their four grandchildren. The day included shopping for costumes, dinner at the ersatz "Babbo" restaurant, a ride on a carnival-carousel, and an old-fashioned birthday party in a local townhouse decorated with a tree and lots of candles. But a series of events led to the first death in the Pyle household.Pyle was a tech mogul who built the successful Annapolis Systems Group, a $4 billion company that was among the world's most competitive businesses. Last week, a fire that started in his basement destroyed the company and nearly all of its employees.Pyle, 58, was a prominent investor in several technology companies, including AOL and Microsoft. He was also the founder of a nonprofit organization, the Annapolis Foundation, which is seeking to help disadvantaged children in the Annapolis area.Pyle's sudden death has drawn comparisons to the death of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose body was found hanging from a Boston hotel room balcony in 2000. The details of Pyle's death are still emerging, but many are speculating that it was suicide.Pyle was a "fervid humanist" who "thought there was something wrong with the world, and that society didn't live up to its moral potential," according to his brother, Craig Pyle. "He did so much for philanthropy and had done so much for others' children, but he was also a very private person," Pyle said. "And this had to do with his faith and his spirituality."If you think about what he did and what he had done, he lived a life that reflected what he believed."Pyle's company at a loss of face: The latest in a series on big business, including the 2008 bailout of Wall Street firms and the failure of GM to turn around in the face of a crisisThe Annapolis fire: An outpouring of grief in Annapolis and around the countryA life of contrasts: The tale of a tech heir and philanthropist who died in a blaze that could have been avoidedDon Pyle's suicide and mental illnesses: The story behind his apparent death and the struggle of Maryland's mental health community to understand the causeThe aftermath: After the fire, P	0
Several times a day, helicopters land and take off from the helipad above Seattle's Fisher Plaza. But this time was different. The sound -- what the lead investigator described as an "unusual noise" -- gave  -- a "roaring sound" -- pause. Then, with a roar, they roared back; first one, then another, and another. The noise came not from the helicopter, but from the roof of a nearby building. The noise was so loud it drowned out the sirens. "That was just one of the things that made it difficult to hear," said Seattle Police Department lead investigator Jeff Moulton. "We thought it might be a vehicle or something that would be coming through the traffic." Moulton and fellow investigator Brett Anderson arrived at the Fisher Plaza helipad at about 6 p.m. They quickly assessed that the noise was coming from a single-floored, one-and-a-half story building nearby. It was just a little later when Moulton began to hear it. It was more like a "roaring" sound, he said, and coming from the roof of what seemed to be a three-story concrete building. "It was more like the roof was moving, and then it was very quiet again," said Moulton, who has been a police officer for about a year and a half. "It was weird because you just couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. The sirens were screaming." At first, Moulton thought it might be one of the nearby residents having trouble hearing the sirens because of the building's height (about 17 feet above the plaza and parking area). But he thought the noise came from the concrete building's roof when he started paying attention. The noise continued for about four minutes, he said, before it came back and continued for another five minutes. It is unclear whether it was coming from the roof again or the building's basement, which is more than 150 feet away. "I could feel that it was coming from the concrete building," said Moulton, who estimates the building is at least 10 stories. The building's windows are steel frames that can be easily reached, and the noise was coming from the basement. He estimated the person or persons responsible created a very loud noise during the "raging" noise. Investigators were not sure whether the noise came from a mechanical or natural event, Moulton said. A similar racket was heard over	0
The government of Peru on Friday declared a state of emergency in a remote northern area after a clash between police and indigenous people protesting what they say is the exploitation of their native lands left a number of people dead. Alberto Pizango, a leader of the protesters, says his followers did not kill police officers. Police and indigenous protesters said separately that at least eight police and 22 protesters died. The clash took place at dawn outside the northern province of Bagua in the Department of Amazonas as police attempted to break up a roadblock on the 59th day of protests. Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Español that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters. Under the state of emergency, the army can be called on to maintain order. "Look, the use of force is legitimate," he said. "Today, what we have received in response were gunshots -- directed at police helicopters, killing eight or nine police." But Alberto Pizango, the principal leader of the indigenous group, said his followers could not have been responsible for killing any police, because they were armed only with stones and arrows. He said the demonstrators had been pursuing a peaceful protest. Authorities have not confirmed the number of civilian deaths. The director general of the police, Jose Sanchez Farfan, said government buildings in Bagua had been looted and set aflame. Though a congressional commission has recommended the repeal of the laws rejected by the native communities, President Alan Garcia supports those that allow using the lands, maintaining that the richness of the Amazon belongs to all Peruvians and that a significant percentage of natural areas are already protected. "These people don't have crowns," he said about the protesters. "These people aren't first-class citizens who can say -- 400,000 natives to 28 million Peruvians -- 'You don't have the right to be here.' No way. That is a huge error." Garcia called Pizango a criminal. Several days ago, Garcia announced an arrest warrant had been issued for Pizango, who is accused of inciting his followers to violence. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this story from Lima.	1
Michigan authorities are pursuing a new lead in the case of the infamous Oakland County child killer who abducted and murdered at least four boys and girls in the 1970s. "We would be thrilled if this is the one piece of evidence that we are looking for to give closure to the families, but we want to do our due diligence" said Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw. Parts of a blue AMC Gremlin with a white stripe were unearthed at a construction site in Grand Blanc Township on Monday. The car matches the description of a vehicle seen near the scene of one of the kidnappings. New DNA work may offer break in slayings "We received an anonymous tip of car parts recovered in the excavation of a new homes subdivision," Shaw told CNN. "There was that blue colored Gremlin with the white stripe down the side of it. We sent out our crime lab from Bridgeport to investigate and see what the situation was. "Right now we are continuing to excavate the site to see if there is any more evidence we can locate," Shaw said. The Oakland County Child Killer Task Force was also notified, Shaw added. The search for the serial killer has lasted for more than 36 years. Police agencies have pursued some 20,000 tips in the hunt for the perpetrator of the unsolved murders, which took place over a 13-month period between 1976 and 1977. Mark Stebbins was 12 when he was abducted in Ferndale on February 15, 1976. His body was found nearly a year later. Jill Robinson was also 12 when she was kidnapped on December 22, 1976. Her body was found four days later. Kristin Mihelich was 10 when she disappeared in Berkley on January 2, 1977, and her body was found later that month. Timothy King was 11 when he vanished in Birmingham on March 16, 1977. His body was found one week later. Several other children who went missing or were killed during that time may period also may have been victims of the Oakland County child killer, according to the task force. Shaw cautioned that this new lead may turn up empty. "We're not sure if this has anything to do with it," he said. "In Michigan, this used to be farm land so it was common for farmers to bury their scrap metal. Since this is a vehicle that we have been looking for for years, we will make sure if it's part of the crime scene or isn't, and rule it out.	1
Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors have dropped charges against an 18-year-old man accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in July at a Keith Urban concert south of Boston. "Given the state of the evidence and the facts, there's a decision that we have to make, and all of usare going to have to make," Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said. The newscomes a week after Boston police arrested and charged a 17-year-old boy on chargesof sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl at a Boston nightclub in October. "Given theoverwhelming evidence, I think what we have to do is charge one of these young men," Quinn said. Quinn said he has not discussed the case with Boston Police Assistantchief William Avigliano, who recommended that charges be filed against the teenager. But the district attorney said he plans to discuss the issue with Avigliano in the coming weeks. "It's a difficult decision, but I think this young man should be charged," Quinn said. Boston Police Capt. John Delaney, who reviewed the case with Avigliano and other officers, said that "The evidence is overwhelming... I thought that wasthe state of the record." Delaney said he did not know whether any arrests were beingmade, or whether the teenage girl will ever be charged. Avigliano said that Aviglianomade the recommendation to charge the teenage suspect, despite the fact that he had not reviewed the evidence. "I've been out of the police department for three days," Avigliano said. He said the teenager's name was not released because he is still being interrogated. Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said that there is not much more he cansay about the case. Quinn made the decision alone after receiving a letter from agrand jury, informing him that charges should not be brought. "I'm not going tomake any comment beyond that, other than to say that it's part of the process andyou do what's best for the community," Quinn said. Quinn said the decision came afterreviewing the evidence at the Bristol County House of Correction, where the girl waslocked up before a bail hearing. Quinn said that the teen's lawyers also submittedletters to support their side of the case, but a	0
First, let's be clear: No one can blame voters if they a) are turned off by this election, b) are worried more about other things in their lives and c) don't think that it matters much who controls the Senate, which is what is up for grabs this year. I mean, who could be inspired by Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes as she refuses to say whether she voted for President Obama, citing her constitutional right to privacy. (As a public candidate for public office, no less.) And then there's her opponent, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is so eager to win re-election (and possibly lead a Senate majority) that while calling for the repeal of Obamacare, he also says that the Kentucky health care exchange—which is working well—could continue. "I think it's fine to have a website," he allowed. Huh? So OK, I get that, to a degree, this is a Seinfeld election, a show about nothing. Except for this: When the show is over, and if control of the Senate changes to the Republicans, it could matter. Not in the suddenly-we-are-all-going-to-work-together kind of way. But rather, in the it's-in-my-self-interest-to-get-something-done kind of way. Without being too Pollyannish, let me posit this: If there is unified Republican control of the legislative branch, Republicans would be smart to do some much-needed repair work on the brand. This is not an argument for voting for Republicans; it's a possible route out of the gridlock. Right now, too many voters see the GOP as just the party of stopping stuff, not inventing stuff. In a midterm election, that can work: Obama is unpopular, tie all candidates to Obama. Bingo, Senate majority. But if Republicans take charge of the Congress, they will have run out of excuses. And they will have the opportunity to say, hey, it wasn't us bollixing up the works. It was Harry Reid.	1
The FBI's Ten Most Wanted list now includes a man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler son execution-style in 2010. Juan Elias Garcia, who the FBI calls an "enthusiastic murderer," now has a $100,000 reward on his head. "Garcia's callous disregard for human life resulted in the senseless murder of a young mother and her helpless 2-year-old son," said George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, on the agency's website. Garcia is alleged to be a member of the violent MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, gang. He's thought to be hiding in El Salvador. The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings. Slaying victim Vanessa Argueta, 19, is said to have had a romantic relationship with Garcia -- and she's also believed to have had ties to two rival gangs: the 18th Street gang and the Latin Kings. "They were going to kill her for disrespecting the gang," said Special Agent James Lopez in the FBI release. "It is unacceptable for MS-13 members to have girls they associate with be involved with rival gang members." The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods. There, they were met by two co-conspirators -- members of Mara Salvatrucha -- and Argueta was murdered in front of her son. The FBI said the same gun was then used to kill the little boy. Considered armed and dangerous, Garcia is 5 foot, 4 inches and weighs 125 pounds. He was 17 and answered to the nickname "Cruzito" at the time of the slayings on February 4, 2010. "His appointment to the FBI's Top Ten list illustrates not only the seriousness of his crimes but our commitment to seeking justice for his victims," said Venizelos. The FBI requests that anyone with information on Garcia contact its New York Field Office at 212-384-1000, a nearby law enforcement agency or U.S. Embassy or Consulate. People can also submit a tip online. Teen accused of gunning down family 'lost sense of conscience' CNN's Forrest Brown contributed to this report.	1
Under mounting pressure from activists and advertisers, Facebook is ramping up efforts to stamp out hate speech, particularly depictions of violence against women. The move, announced Tuesday, came after a weeklong campaign by women's groups targeting pages that celebrated or made light of rape, domestic violence and sexual degradation of women. "In recent days, it has become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate," Marne Levine, a Facebook vice president in charge of public policy, wrote in a post on the site. "In some cases, content is not being removed as quickly as we want. In other cases, content that should be removed has not been or has been evaluated using outdated criteria. We have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations, but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards. We need to do better -- and we will." A coalition of women's groups, under the banner Women, Action & the Media, celebrated the announcement, saying that Facebook has asked them to be part of an ongoing conversation about improvements to the social network. Pages flagged as offensive by the group had such names as "Kicking Your Girlfriend in the Fanny Because She Won't Make You a Sandwich," "Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs," "Raping Your Girlfriend" and "Fly Kicking Sluts in the Uterus." Searching for those pages Wednesday delivered no results. "It is because Facebook has committed to having policies to address these issues that we felt it was necessary to take these actions and press for that commitment to fully recognize how the real world safety gap experienced by women globally is dynamically related to our online lives," author Soraya Chemaly, who helped spearhead the effort, said in a post on the group's site. In Levine's post, Facebook promised to: -- Update guidelines that its Community Standards team uses to identify hate speech, with help from legal experts and women's groups -- Update training for team members who police hate speech -- Increase accountability for Facebook users whose pages don't legally qualify as hate speech but who post content that is "cruel or insensitive" -- Implement a policy that requires users who create pages with questionable content to publicly attach their personal account to them -- Encourage groups already working on cyber-hate issues to include the women's coalition.	1
With its palaces, sculpted parks, concert halls and museums, Vienna is a city steeped in culture. Once home to composers including Beethoven, Mozart, and Johann Strauss, and to artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar  Klimt, and Max Beckmann, it has also been the setting for several important events, including the Vienna Secession, the Internationaler Komponistenkongress and the Vienna World Youth Days. It also has been called the "cultural centre of Europe and the world" because of such events, but Vienna also has a number of its own significant arts scenes.The major centres are the three principal ones: the Graziadio Casino, the Wiener Konzerthaus in Favoritenstrasse, and the Vienna State Opera, both in Hietzing and the Französische Strasse, the Museumsbibliothek, the Jewish Museum Vienna and the Austrian National Library. The city's contemporary art scene can be seen at the Galerie Niederländischer Malerei, the Galerie Lutte, the Galerie Imago, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, the Museum of Art and Architecture, and in the various museums in the inner city.The city has a number of smaller but significant art centres. These include the following: the Gasteig, the Salzburger Kunsthalle in Günzburg, Kollikspielgalerie im Museum der Moderne, the Kunsthaus Bethanien in Vienna-Neulengasse and the Haus der Geschichte der Kunst in Klosterneuburg.As a university city, Vienna is home to the University of Vienna (founded in 1248, as the Faculty of Law; nowadays University of Music, Vienna) and its three faculties, the Vienna University of Economics and Business, Technical University of Vienna (now called ZTÜ), and the University of Arts and Law. University City also hosts the Vienna State Opera and the Austrian National Library, as well as numerous other museums.HistoryThe history of Vienna ranges from as early as the Stone Age to the present era, from Roman times until the end of the 20th century. It has seen major historical events such as the Mongol invasions in the 13th century that left Austria the largest territory between	0
A Kalispell, Montana, newlywed accused of pushing her husband from a cliff wants her trial postponed after prosecutors told her attorney they have evidence her husband was blindfolded before falling to his death, court documents say. Saying the prosecution has provided no evidence regarding the use of a blindfold -- which could be used to make the government's case for premeditation and thus first-degree murder -- Jordan Linn Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, asserts that he is unprepared to defend his client if the trial is held in December as planned. Donahoe further said he learned of the "blindfold theory" and the DNA testing of "a piece of cloth found on a shoal in the river" only during an October 25 conference call, more than three weeks after it was sent to an FBI lab and 10 weeks after it was collected from the alleged crime scene. That timing is important, the attorney says, because if the "alleged blindfold" was not sent to a lab until at least October 2, the day before the indictment was filed, it "would suggest the blindfold theory was not put to the grand jury at all." "If, as is stated in the complaint affidavit, Jordan and Cody (Johnson) were arguing intensely on the ledge, it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so Jordan could apply a blindfold," says Donahoe's brief supporting a motion to dismiss the case. "Frankly at this point the defense has no idea of how the government intends to try this case before the petite jury and likewise has grave doubt about what was put before the grand jury." Donahoe further slams the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for its handling of Graham's interrogation and subsequent report based on that interrogation. The case is being handled federally because the alleged crime happened in a national park. The report, which alleges an FBI interrogator inappropriately touched Graham's knee during the interview, states that almost an hour and a half of Graham's interrogation was not recorded, despite the necessary equipment being on hand. Failing to preserve such evidence, which includes Graham's first admission that she had previously lied, is a violation of Graham's rights, the defense brief says. Other parts of the interview were misconstrued or provided without necessary context, according to the papers filed by Donahoe, which labels the government's version of Graham's statement "incomplete, coerced and subject to suppression."	1
At least 76 people died in Norway in a terror attack July 22 that started with a bomb blast in the capital Oslo and continued with an hour-long gun rampage at a camp for Labour Party teens and young adults on nearby Utoya Island. Police arrested a lone gunman, Anders Breivik, 32. Here are the latest developments. NEW DEVELOPMENTS --Anders Breivik was " a little bit surprised" that his attacks succeeded, his lawyer Geir Lippestad says Tuesday, adding that Breivik had not expected to get to Utoya Island. --The suspect was on drugs to make him stronger and more awake during the attacks, Lippestad says. He says Breivik "may be" insane, but that it is too early to say if he will mount an insanity defense. --Police say they will announce Tuesday when they will publish the list of names of the victims. --Police continue to search Utoya island and the surrounding waters for four or five missing people, and the island itself for clues. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED --Anders Breivik, 32, appeared in closed court Monday. Judge Kim Heger later says Breivik admits carrying out the attacks but claims they were necessary to prevent the "colonization" of the country by Muslims. Breivik says the deaths are the price the Labour Party had to pay for its "treason," the judge says. --Judge Heger orders Breivik held in custody for eight weeks, until his next court date. The first four weeks are to be in solitary confinement to prevent the possibility of tampering with evidence, the judge says. --The suspect's father, Jens Breivik, tells Norway's TV2 that his son must have mental problems. "In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life," the father says, answering a reporter's question about mental illness by saying: "There is no other way to explain it. A normal person would never do such a thing." --Police announce Monday that the number of confirmed dead in the bombing is eight, an increase of one from previous reports. The number of dead on Utoya is 68, down from earlier reports as high as 86. That makes the confirmed death toll 76, down from earlier reports of 93.	1
Even a watered-down version of the law couldn't pass muster: San Francisco's ordinance requiring retail outlets to inform consumers about the (alleged) effects of cell phone radiation has been blocked by a federal judge. Upon passage, San Francisco's ordinance was challenged by industry trade group CTIA-The Wireless Association, which claimed the ordinance's requirement that retailers post messages about cell phone safety violated the First Amendment. San Francisco initially agreed to amend the ordinance after the CTIA filed suit, and made some changes, but they weren't enough. Judge William Alsup found that the ordinance failed the sniff test on both scientific and First Amendment grounds. "Whether or not cell phones cause cancer is a debatable question and, at this point in history, is a matter of opinion, not fact. San Francisco has its opinion. The industry has the opposite opinion," wrote Judge Alsup. The fact-sheet required by the ordinance is "misleading and must be corrected," notes the judge. "Although each factoid in isolation may have an anchor in some article somewhere, the overall message of the fact-sheet (and the poster, for that matter) is misleading by omission in two important ways. The overall impression left is that cell phones are dangerous and that they have somehow escaped the regulatory process." The World Health Organization issued a report that seemingly butressed San Francisco's position in May when it labeled cellphones "possibly carcinogenic," meaning that there is "limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals." But results of a massive, 15-year-long study released earlier this month showed absolutely no link between cellphone use and cancer, echoing the findings of numerous other studies. The judge left the door open to the possibility that a revised "fact sheet" could pass muster and stayed the enforcement of the law until November 30 so that both sides can file appeals. San Francisco has already promised to do exactly that. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM	1
I once stayed at a youth hostel in Copenhagen called Sleep in Heaven. Which sounds quite pleasant until you realize that, apparently, heaven is cold and damp and completely infested with bedbugs. I guess that's the part they don't tell  you about in the hostel brochure.But I digress. For the purposes of this piece we will call the hostel Sleep in Heaven. It was great for six days, and then I had to move on. Fortunately, since I was in a hurry to get home I had a good book in my pocket called Welcome to the Jungle. On the one hand, it's a great book about travel, on the other hand it's a great book about sex.One night I was in bed reading Welcome to the Jungle, when I had this amazing feeling that just as this book was about travel, it could be about love. It went from being a book about travel to a book about sex. I was suddenly and utterly obsessed with it. I had to have it. And all the while my mind was racing with the same thought: How do I get that book? Find a place to borrow it.A few hours later I looked up the nearest library, saw that it was closed for the night, looked up the nearest library website, and found a link to an article about a place called Book Depository. I read the article and then I realized that I had absolutely nothing about reading and that this was going to be a real problem.The next thing I remember is me being lying on the floor in a pool of my own hot piss. For a second I was too busy taking a massive crap to get up and walk away. I was really, really stoned. And so was this other guy, who was sitting on the same floor. We were both peeing. Our pants were down, our heads were down, and we were both still peeing. Eventually, with a huge pile of my own hot piss on the floor between us, we both got up and left.That night I walked up to the library and borrowed Sleep in Heaven. I had read it twice in the week that it had been waiting in my cupboard, and couldn't believe that I had just bought it. I couldn't believe it. It was like a drug. The book didn't even seem to affect my sexual desire at the time.Sleeping in Heaven became	0
Russia's top diplomat said Thursday the nation will permit NATO to move armored vehicles through Russia to Afghanistan, state-run Russian media said. "The eased transit regulations have been extended to armored vehicles with anti-mine protection," Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after discussions in Moscow, Russia, with Afghan foreign minister Zalmay Rasul, according to state-run RIA Novosti. At the NATO summit in Lisbon, Portugal, last week, Russia and the alliance agreed to "broadened transit arrangements through Russian territory" of "non-lethal" material. The cargo would be moved through Russia to and from Afghanistan. "We underlined the importance of international efforts in support of the Afghan government and in promoting regional peace and stability. In that context, the revised arrangements aimed at further facilitating railway transit of non-lethal ISAF goods through Russian territory are of particular value," the NATO-Russia Council Joint Statement said Saturday. The agreement will help NATO's International Security Force break its dependency on Pakistani authorities to allow supplies and vehicles to get through. Pakistan last month temporarily closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian permanent representative to NATO, said the matter refers to vehicles for transporting civilians only, Interfax news agency reported, citing remarks he made on Echo Moskvy radio. "This has been made so that they could freely move even if militants using improvised explosive devices step up their activities," Rogozin said. "We have not given and will not give our consent to transportation of military cargo by rail through Russian territory."	1
By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body. The attack took place off a  beach in Rotorua - but by the time it was known, the shark had gotten the victim to his death.Newshub has requested an interview with the authorities in the case of the victim, who has been identified as Australian Richard Lloyd.Newshub can reveal that the attack - which saw the shark bite off the right leg of the man’s body - happened just before 6pm.The man was an Australian who had been on the beach for a number of hours, Newshub understands."We are looking at this person [a shark] as a potential predator," Newshub can reveal."The area is highly shark-prone and that could have been a factor in the attack."Rotorua Beach was closed for the incident, and while the swimmer is now facing charges in New Zealand for the attack, the man who died is yet to be charged.A photograph shows the man’s leg, just before he was bitten by the shark.The victim's family are now appealing for his body to be released to their family."We know that it’s not right. It should be put to rest and that should be able to happen," the victim’s mother said."I just want him home once and for all ... It’s not fair that it’s gone on while we’ve had him in our lives ... [I want] to just see him, really see him and hug him and kiss him.The victim’s mother also wants to know how often it happens and where the shark is getting its food - just in case the shark becomes aggressive."If it’s going to be aggressive, we want to know that. And we want to find out, do they hunt this area or what is it? Because it’s a real predator we want to know."So we want to know the exact details of the attack and how you know it’s coming, it’s kind of a scary thing. And we want to know what the risk is, that way we can stop it."The victim	0

In the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, embattled Penn State University is hosting a sexual abuse conference and says boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and Elizabeth Smart will give speeches. The conference will be held on October 29-30 and comes after the well-publicized scandal that culminated with the conviction of Sandusky, a former assistant Penn State football coach on multiple charges of sexual abuse of young boys. "Over the last nine months, Penn State has made a commitment to becoming a leader in the research, prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse, and we have taken a number of steps to ensure that our communities are safer," Penn State President Rodney Erickson said in a message promoting the conference. Leonard, a boxing icon, is known for his lightning fast hands, legendary fights and recently for his role in several reality television shows. But last year in his autobiography, Leonard delivered the surprising admission that early in his career he was sexually abused by an unnamed Olympic boxing coach. Penn State accreditation in jeopardy over sex abuse scandal Smart made headlines in 2002 when she was kidnapped from her Utah home at age 14 and held captive for nine months. Her kidnapping stunned the nation, and the media covered the months-long search to find her. Her abductor, Brian David Mitchell, sexually abused her during her time in captivity and is serving life in prison for the kidnapping and assault. Recently Smart has married and become an advocate for change related to child abduction. Penn State has had its share of bad headlines since Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 male victims. In July former FBI Director Louis Freeh released a report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky, stating that the school's leadership showed "total and consistent disregard" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky. Also last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Former senator to be integrity monitor for Penn State athletics Jordana Ossad contributed to this report.	1
Inter Milan will learn their early group opponents as they begin their defense of the Champions League crown when the draw is made in Monaco on Thursday. Milan, who beat Bayern Munich in last May's final, are in the same top-seeded pot with the Germans. They are joined by British trio Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, Spanish giants Barcelona, city rivals AC Milan and French side Lyon. Inter could face Real Madrid, now managed by Jose Mourinho, who led them to their triple Serie A, Champions League, Italian Cup triumph last season before departing to the Bernabeu. Real are in the second pot as are Spanish rivals Valencia. Another potentially tricky hurdle might be English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, who are in the third pot of eight. Tottenham qualified for the Champions League group stages with a thumping 4-0, aggregate 6-3 win, over Young Boys of Berne. Under Champions League rules they cannot face either of the other three English clubs at the first stage. Scottish champions Rangers are also in pot three, while the favorites will also want to avoid Portuguese side Braga, who put out La Liga's Sevilla in the result of the third qualifying round this week. Pot four contains the likes of Russian champions Rubin Kazan and Dutch title winners FC Twente. The 32 qualified teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams, with the top two from each group going through to the last 16 knockout stages. Each group will contain a top seed, plus one club each from the second, third and fourth pots. The opening set of group games will take place on September 14 and 15, with the final scheduled for England's famous Wembley stadium on May 28, 2011.	1

"We're going to find out at some point."John and Lisa Hildner of the Philippines have served a Marine family in the Philippines since 1981, when John was just 22, according to his relatives.Earlier this week, John Hildner helped his father load a boat with supplies for Marines, including new boots, tents, and ammunition, which included a package labeled "Terence."Terence Hildner was killed in a vehicle-ramming that occurred in Lashkar Gah district in Helmand province on Saturday.Terence Hildner, a father of four, was a lieutenant colonel, but had served in several combat assignments, according to his LinkedIn profile.He was a platoon leader with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 10th Marine Expeditionary Unit, "a combat-hardened team of Marines who deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom," according to information posted on the official U.S. Navy website.Terence Hildner served in Afghanistan during the 2003 invasion, and during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Hildner was born in Portland, Oregon,	0
Here's a 21st-century art object if ever there was one: a Japanese film by a French-Vietnamese writer-director based on a 1987 international best-seller named after a 1965 Beatles' song about Scandinavian pine. Well,  "a documentary" to be precise, in the strictest sense of the word. But that's another story."Eggs and Gravy" is an all-white-chicks, all-boys story directed by Daniel Proulx, with a youngish cast including Nicolas Le Person, the son of the legendary French director Georges Méliès.The only black character is Tintin, the lead character in "The Adventures of Tintin" comics. It's the kind of story that's a great fit for an animated movie. The story is about a group of high school guys who get drunk and go out in a forest in the middle of nowhere in order to hunt and be the best hunters. The French-Vietnamese director Daniel Proulx, whose credits include the excellent film "The Dream Life of Johnny Depp" and the 2006 short "The Wicker Man" about the real-life folklorist Pauline Park has been in the French-Vietnamese film scene for a long time.One of the most beautiful settings in the world, the forest in question is that of the French Alps. It's said that if you follow the road of the Eiffel Tower, you arrive at the place where it meets the forest.The film is made in French at its very best. The sound, by Peter Lindgren, is absolutely exquisite, a mix of French music and a wonderful musical score. As in the best of the French films of French-Vietnamese director Proulx, there is a very precise narrative and a powerful, beautiful acting.The main character, Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a schoolboy hero for whom "Eggs and Gravy" is named, is played by Nicolas Le Person . He doesn't have much to do in the film than be a guy that everybody loves and loves everybody.At his first class, he starts as a good pupil, but as the movie develops, he gradually becomes a character that people won't forget in a hurry. If he didn't have the presence of mind to find a way out of the situation, if	0
Lionel Messi will captain Argentina for the first time as they take on Venezuela in a friendly in cricket-mad India Friday. Messi has Ã¢ÂÂThe GreatestÃ¢ÂÂ written all over him for his performances over the course of these three consecutive World Cup wins, and heÃ¢ÂÂs also made a point to bring along those teammates who have helped him become the best football player in the world. Argentina's goal is to play to its strength and to get Messi. The problem for Argentina is that theyÃ¢ÂÂre not quite sure what it is.A day after Messi announced his retirement, Lionel's former Spain manager Luis Aragones was fired by the Argentines club. He had left the team after the disappointing Copa America performance in 2014, even though they finished fourth. However the former Argentina captain was sacked in August for saying his Ã¢ÂÂblows Ã¢ÂÂ I was not surprised at allÃ¢ÂÂ had weakened the side.The former Arsenal midfielder has come out in support of the Gunners as he prepares to leave his hometown club at the end of the season. The 28-year-old believes Arsenal must fight hard and get back in to the Champions League and he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt expect Arsene to come back into the fold.The Spaniard says he has spent 10 years being a fan of Arsenal and feels they are now the true Champions. Arsenal have had some good results this season, their run of form included a 5-1 win over Liverpool, who looked like they were in trouble after conceding early in the second half.The 26-year-old has always had a talent for attacking football, playing alongside Barcelona and Spain on the biggest stages on the planet. Now, he appears set to join Real Madrid, who are looking to take one step closer to winning the Champions League.After Barcelona, Real Madrid are probably the team that he could have played for. However, at this point, his long-term future is at Gunners.Cristiano Ronaldo is ready to sign a three-year contract offer from Chelsea after being impressed by the clubÃ¢ÂÂs performances during the Ã¢ÂÂ�	0

The first person ever convicted in Idaho of knowingly spreading the HIV virus is facing new charges for the same offense, Â and the federal government has brought a new civil lawsuit on behalf of the defendant.The new civil lawsuit has been filed by the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, which alleges that Darryl James, 23, knowingly spread the HIV virus, as well as three other diseases, from 1996 to 1998.Darryl James, of Kellogg, Idaho, is being charged with knowingly spreading the HIV virus on Sept. 28, 2008, at the University of Florida, and then again while at the University of Idaho in October 2008. Darryl was also charged as a defendant in the federal civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, which alleges that James knowingly spread HIV and AIDS at the University of Idaho in June of 2008.James received treatment at the University Hospital in Idaho for his alleged infected blood transfusion in June as part of the University of Idaho HIV/AIDS Project. He was a member of the U of I men's track and field team, and the U of I men's volleyball team, from 1998 to 2002. James was a former member of the NCAA Division II men's volleyball team at St. Thomas University. James is being held at the Ada County jail.James' attorney, William Moomaw, said, "This is a very sad day for Darryl, his family and for the University of Idaho. Darryl is innocent of these charges, and we will fight this every step of the way. This is a sad day for the U of I family, and for the University of Idaho. Darryl is a young man who has dedicated his life to improving the lives of others, and he deserves to be treated fairly and appropriately."James had been a member of a co-op class that was one of the most successful in U of I history. He helped raise over $2,000 for the school's AIDS program, was elected co-president of the U of I University Council, was a member of the Interfraternity Council and Phi Sigma Kappa, as well as a member of the student government, Student Council, and President's Honor Society.James was arrested at the University of Idaho and booked on charges of knowingly spreading HIV and AIDS on June 8, 2008, at the Boise Police station.

Two U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets -- flying off the  aircraft carrier Ford -- perform aerobatic maneuvers and fly together in the blue sky over the Arabian Gulf during the 2019 Rim of the Pacific military exercise. (Photo by U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class James Erskine)“We’re excited about how all of this is going on that we’re seeing,” said Lt. Gen. Kevin Alexander, commander of Combined Air and Space Operations, part of the Pentagon’s joint force.A number of different units of all nine U.S. armed services and other partners have been involved in the exercises, scheduled to start May 20 in Bahrain, and run through July.The exercises simulate the threat posed by a fast-moving military aircraft attack with a high-energy weapon, which is “a very common threat from adversaries in the Arabian Gulf, and probably elsewhere in the world,” said Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, the head of the Joint Force staff, the Pentagon’s military planning and policy integration unit.It’s one of a series of military exercises that will be conducted in the Arabian Gulf region in 2019. These are intended to prepare defense forces for “the day when aircraft carry weapons capable of striking with high explosive or air-to-surface missiles,” said Davis.The exercise involves Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine units flying simulated missions in a variety of combat scenarios in a bid to advance air training abilities. The goal, according to Davis, is: “to improve the air force’s operational capability within the joint force environment.”For some of the service-specific aspects, here are the drills:The Navy will be conducting carrier-based, low-observable training, or LOTO, to simulate combat operations for the carrier strike group (CSG). Each of the three LCS “phantom” destroyers was to undergo a combat exercise, and some of the CSGs will, too, Davis said.These exercises are also aimed at training fighter training crews to learn to fly and command aircraft, Davis said.In a separate exercise, the Navy is conducting a low-level flight and air-to-ground training scenario focused on anti-ship missiles, which is called Maritime Interception	0
In its short, sweet first season, Shonda Rhimes' Scandal introduced powerhouse political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her powerful associates, including President Fitzgerald "Fitz"  Porter (Tony Goldwyn) and his trusted confidant, Chief of Staff Walter "Walt" Buchanan (Brian stan) . Scandal was met with a lukewarm reception by critics (primarily the media) and proved popular with viewers, even earning 1.5 stars from The New York Times and 1.5 stars from the San Francisco Chronicle. However, some critics criticized Scandal from the get go, saying that the show was too "soft" on the President and too "soft" on the Vice President. Scandal's first season ended at 1.75 million total viewers, with a 2.5 rating in the 18-49 demo. In the second season, Scandal dropped just under half of its viewers, with 1.1 million total viewers, and a 1.5 rating in the demo. After the second season, season 3 of Scandal was originally greenlit and would have revolved around the scandal surrounding Olivia Pope (and her powerful associates), especially as it involved the Vice President. Executive producer Shonda Rhimes was however unable to secure a third season of Scandal, and instead decided to air the spin-off series How to Get Away With Murder in order to bring new viewers to the series, which was then cancelled in the summer of 2015 when Scandal was renewed for a third season.Although not as popular as the first season, Scandal did average a respectable 1.8 million viewers in season two, and the ratings did not drop for the entire second season. In the second season, the series also introduced the character of Hope Mikaelson Pope (Erika Christensen), who is the Vice President's daughter and is played by the same actress who played her teenage self in the first season. The character was described by The New York Times as "a young and sweetly self-centered woman, a bit of a showoff". The character is described in the series' second episode as "a high school dropout, a former cheerleader who likes to go to parties" with "the most outrageous 'best friend' in town." Also, while in the first season, Hope Mikaelson was described as "a woman who seemed to take a lot of her political power for granted" and that "her	0
Editor's note: Wayne LaPierre has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America since 1991. His latest book is "The Global War on Your Guns: Inside the  Gun-Control Movement and the Assault on the Second Amendment" published by HarperCollins. He holds a B.A. degree from Dartmouth College with distinction and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. LaPierre is currently the NRA's president.(CNN) -- Here's proof that the right to keep and bear arms really does mean something.A 17-year-old Maryland girl, a member of a pro-gun militia, has been charged with the murder of a woman she says was her rival for the affections of her high school football team.The suspect in the death of Christina Reardon-Yost's best friend says the schoolgirl murdered the 18-year-old sophomore who was killed with the gun she had been carrying to a school dance on April 25.The same gun reportedly killed Reardon-Yost's friend, who was a freshman at the high school.The teen says his version of what happened the night she killed Reardon-Yost, a senior at the Greenbelt High School, is much different than the version being presented by deputies.But what's really important in this case is where the girl got the gun.It apparently was on her own."We found her in a vehicle that was parked on the street. There was a bullet hole in the back of her head and a blood trail leading from the vehicle," said George Allen, a spokesman for Montgomery County police.The gun, he said, reportedly was a .22-caliber pistol, also known as a "Saturday night special."That's a "Saturday night special" -- a gun used primarily by drug dealers. Its purpose is to be used by a dealer on a Saturday night to dispose of a dead body or someone who turns out to be a snitch.A spokesman for the Greenbelt School District could not confirm that a gun was found at the site of the school's shooting. But he assured CNN that, in a message, the girl has been suspended from school and has been in counseling.There have been no arrests or charges of any kind, but the county police press conference revealed some disturbing details of what occurred on the evening.	0
Flags were flown at half-staff in the Philippines Friday as the nation observed a day of mourning for 44 police commandos killed in a disastrous operation in the country's Muslim south. The officers, members of Â­police's elite and elite special-operations unit, were killed in a firefight with suspected Islamist militants on a highway.The commandos were participating in a joint United States-Philippine task force when they were killed, according to a statement issued by President Benigno Aquino III on Friday.Aquino, in a statement carried on the AP, called the tragedy an "unspeakable tragedy." He said they all loved their job and that they would be remembered "as heroes who died on a mission to protect the common good."As the AP reported from Manila, "The slain officers — 45-year-old Capt. James F. Espinoza, 43-year-old Sgt. Joel S. Acosta, 45-year-old Sgt. Eduardo P. Lim, 45-year-old Sgt. Edwin L. Echaniz and 40-year-old Lt. Rene V. Cruz — were part of a U.S. task force working to find and destroy the remnants of a so-called Jemaah Islamiya terrorist group that has waged a bloody insurgency in the south of the country since 2000," and "had vowed to avenge the 2000 massacre of 14 police officers by a Muslim sect in Mamasapano that killed 32 people."The Associated Press reported, "In 2009, a bomb went off at a traffic signal in Marawi, wounding four people, including a police officer. The blast was blamed on Jemaah Islamiya, a group linked to the militant group Al Qaeda and the Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf."The AP and CNN reported, "Jemaah Islamiya, which means 'Land of Islam' in Arabic, has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks, including a series of bombings and kidnappings of American and European tourists in the southern Philippines." The AP said that these attacks "led to the deaths of an estimated 2000 Filipinos."On Sept. 21, 2009, the Associated Press reported that authorities found a copycat bomb near a police station in Mamasapano, wounding two people. The attack was believed to be carried out by Abu Sayyaf militants and blamed on Jemaah Islamiya and the Muslim	0
On Christmas Day last year, Alan Henning was sitting in a brightly lit cafe in southern Turkey, sharing a laugh with his friends before they set off on their journey. Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need. Nicknamed "Gadget" by his peers, Henning was the only non-Muslim in the convoy. He sacrificed Christmas, weekends and family time to do his part for those worst hit by Syria's civil war, and was admired by his fellow volunteers. This was the father-of-two's fourth trip to the war-torn country. While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria itself. In video shot on the day, he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help. "It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go," he said, before hugging a colleague. Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made. He is now under threat of imminent execution. As the clock ticks down, those who made the trip with him are pleading with the leaders of the militant group -- which has declared an independent Islamic state across parts of Syria and Iraq -- to let Henning go. "Alan was moved by the suffering of the Syrian people, in particular the children," Abu Abdullah said in a YouTube plea to his colleague's captors. "Please do not take his life to pay for the crimes that the international governments have committed." On Thursday, more than 100 British Muslim imams and organizations condemned ISIS' tactics and joined the call for Henning to be released. The coalition of Muslim communities is appealing to ISIS and the people around them to persuade the militants to change their ways, according to Mustafa Field, Director of Faiths Forum for London, one of the signatory organizations to the petition. "The un-Islamic fanatics are not acting as Muslims but, as the Prime Minister has said, they're acting as monsters," he told CNN. "They are perpetrating the worst crimes against humanity -- this is not jihad."	1
When night falls over Rwanda, many rural communities far removed from the country's electricity grid descend into darkness. Unplugged from the power lines, households in these areas rely mainly on fuel-based devices such as kerosene lamps for access to light. Such lanterns, however, are polluting and costly: They emit toxic fumes, pose fire hazards and also put a strain on family budgets. But recently, an innovative solution has emerged to offer affordable and efficient electricity to low-income households while benefiting the communities by providing jobs to local populations. Called POWERcycle, Nuru Energy says it has developed "the world's first commercially available pedal generator" -- a foot or hand-powered device that can recharge up to five modular light emitting diode (LED) lamps in approximately 20 minutes, as well as power mobile phones and radios. Read also: Bamboo bikes put Zambian business on right track The company says each of its portable LED lamps provides one week of light to a rural household. It also claims that its products are more affordable and reliable than other forms of off-grid offerings that have been developed in recent years, including solar lamps or home solar lighting systems. "We looked around and said, well, what is the one energy resource that's untapped in this environment? And human power really came to mind," says Sameer Hajee, chief executive and co-founder of Nuru Energy. "We thought, well, if we can harness human energy in a way that we can create economic opportunity and low-power electricity, wouldn't that be a game changing solution?" Watch: Can handmade bicycles change lives? According to Lighting Africa, a joint World Bank - IFC program developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting, 589 million people in the continent live without access to a public electricity facility. The group says African poor rural households and small businesses pay $10 billion per year for lighting purposes, while communities not connected to the grid spend $4.4 billion annually on kerosene. Read also: Pay-as-you-go solar power lights up rural Africa Looking to address the issue of energy poverty, Hajee, a social entrepreneur with a lot of experience in international development, spent more than a month in Rwanda in 2008, trying to figure out what were the energy needs of the country's off-grid population.	1
The "Dream 9," five women and four men, say that they are "undocumented and unafraid." Don't believe it. I bet they were afraid. Who wouldn't have been? The nine -- Claudia Amaro, Adriana Gil Diaz, Luis Leon Lopez, Maria Peniche-Vargas, Ceferino Santiago, LuLu Martinez Valdez, Mario Felix-Garcia, Marco Saavedra and Lizbeth Mateo-Jimenez -- spent more than two weeks in a federal immigration detention facility in Eloy, AZ. Martinez Valdez and Peniche-Vargas--had been put in solitary confinement for what was supposed to be 15 days. All because they wouldn't take "go" for an answer. Some of these "Dreamers" had been deported to Mexico by the Obama administration, though President Obama has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport Dreamers--the name taken by young immigrants who are in the U.S. without papers. Three of them who were on this side of the border -- Saavedra, Martinez Valdez and Mateo-Jimenez -- "self deported" to Mexico to join the other six. Then, on July 22, all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the United States. The idea was to draw attention to the administration's repressive immigration policies. The nine asked for humanitarian parole. When that was denied, they claimed asylum. Opinion: Let's deport Rep. Steve King Now, they have been set free. Earlier in the week, federal officials found that all nine have "credible fear" of persecution or torture in their birth countries and thus cannot be removed without a hearing before an immigration judge. Pending those hearings, the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the United States. It's a major victory for the Dreamer movement. For many, this is a heartwarming story about the power of the individual who is brave enough to make a stand. For others, it is major inconvenience. It's a story that the White House wishes would go away. Ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the Dream 9 and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency.	1
African-Americans are faring slightly worse relative to their white counterparts than they did last year, according to an index released Thursday by the National Urban League. The group's 2011 Equality Index stands at 71.5%, compared to a revised index last year of 72.1%, the league said as it released its annual report, called The State of Black America. An equality index of less than 100% suggests blacks are doing worse relative to whites, while an index greater than 100% suggests blacks are doing better. The league attributed the 2011 drop to a decline in the economics index, driven by housing and wealth factors, and to a decline in the health index, driven by children's health. Economics and social justice continue to be the areas in which blacks trail whites the most, with ratings of 56.9% and 58% respectively. Those are followed by health at 75% and education at 78.9%. Since the Equality Index was introduced in 2005, researchers have found growing equality between blacks and whites in the unemployment rate, the percentage of uninsured, the incarceration rate, and prisoners as a percentage of arrests, the league said. The index has also charted growing inequality over that period in rates of poverty, home ownership, school enrollment (both "preprimary" and college), and the level of educational attainment (both high school diplomas and bachelor's degrees). The index of median household income has remained unchanged, the league said. In 2010, the index measured Hispanics in America for the first time. This year's index finds them faring slightly better than last year compared to their white counterparts, at 76.8% compared to a revised 2010 index of 76.6%, the league said. It attributed the rise to improvements in health and social justice indices, but said those were offset by declines in economics and education. In the past year, the league said it has observed growing gaps in the relative status of blacks and whites in the areas of loan access, wealth and children's health. For Hispanics, there have been growing gaps in the areas of loan access and college enrollment, it said. The 2011 State of Black America report includes essays from a variety of authors including League President Marc Morial and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile.	1
The lawyer representing two Palestinian prisoners entering the 70th day of a hunger strike said his clients were nearing death and accused an Israeli high court of procrastination in delivering a ruling that could save their lives. "Their medical condition has gone from very bad to extremely worse," Jamil al-Khatib said of clients Bilal Diab, 27, and Tha'er Halahlah, 33, "I believe what the court is doing here is trying to break the will of both prisoners so they will back down in their hunger strike." Palestinians protest detention policy Diab and Thaer are among the estimated 1,600 to 2,000 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons staging a mass hunger strike to protest prison conditions and the practice of administrative detention, a controversial Israeli military practice that allows authorities to detain people indefinitely. The process also allows for detention based on secret evidence, and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial. Diab and Halahlah, members of the Gaza-based militant group Islamic Jihad, have been in custody for nine months and 22 months, respectively, under administrative detention. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, told CNN that both men "were arrested for their direct involvement in promoting terror" and suggested that administrative detention constituted "the only available means to thwart the danger" the men posed to Israel. Looking pale and weak, both men appeared in wheelchairs before the Israeli high court Thursday while their lawyers petitioned the judges that they be released, arguing that their continued detention was illegal and that their deteriorating medical conditions should be taken into consideration. The court was expected to rule on the matter Sunday, but no decision was forthcoming. Amany Daify, a project coordinator for Physicians for Human Rights, an Israeli group advocating on behalf of the hunger striking prisoners, said both prisoners "are in a life-threatening condition" and continued to refuse to be given minerals or liquids. "There is no documented history of any person who survived without food or supplements beyond 75 days," Daify said. According to a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Service, Diab is being held at an Israeli hospital while Halahlah is being cared for at prison medical facility. More than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli prisons for a variety of offenses, ranging from rock-throwing to murder. Of these, about 300 are being held in administrative detention, according to rights groups.	1
After divesting from luxury brands purchased in Europe, the Ford Motor Co. is revamping its Lincoln car line to try to recapture the prestige -- and market share -- of the past. "We had purchased Aston Martin and Jaguar and Landover and Volvo, and we had decreased our investment in Lincoln," Ford CEO Alan Mulally told CNN's Richard Quest. "With our One Ford Plan in 2006, we decided to have a laser focus not only on the Ford brand but Lincoln. We continued to invest in the toughest times and the MKZ is our first proof point of a new line of luxury Lincoln vehicles." Ford announced Monday it is renaming its Lincoln division as the Lincoln Motor Co. Lincoln is not being spun off into an altogether separate carmaker, notes CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena, but Ford wants to give it greater separation from the more mass market Ford "blue oval" brand. Lincoln have has its own product development team, designers and salespeople. The all-new MKZ is due to hit the market soon. "As you know the Lincoln has been part of the Ford Motor Co. for nearly 90 years and its always been known for elegant styling and design, inside and out, and also very useful and exciting technology and innovation," Mulally told Quest. Ford was able to avoid the bailouts required to keep U.S. competitors General Motors and Chrysler afloat after an aggressive restructuring that began in 2006, before the financial crisis struck. But the carmaker has been hit of late by the slowdown in the eurozone. The company announced in October the closure of two plants in England and one in Belgium in the next two years, which together employed 5,700 workers. "We are moving very decisively on our better plan to serve the European customers both with a more complete family of best in class vehicles that we describe, but also taking the actions on the productivity and the utilization of our facilities," Mulally said. "It's going to take us a couple years to do that, we know how to do it, everybody watched us do it in the United States." Mulally, who has been among the U.S. CEOs who have met with President Obama on the looming U.S. fiscal cliff, says he's optimistic the talks will avert crisis.	1
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution Monday to send 4,200 peacekeepers to Abyei, Sudan, as part of a recent agreement between Sudan ÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢s government and the rebels. Abyei is the site of the Darfur border between Sudan and Chad. At the meeting, representatives of the U.S., Russia, Britain, France, China and three Latin American nations called on Sudan to allow U.N. observers to monitor Abyei.

We've seen this dynamic before: A mundane and wonky issue that many have never heard of suddenly elevates to national prominence. Remember the debt ceiling and that it was mostly an unknown quantity five years ago? This time it's renewing the authority of Â, the secret agency that runs our nation's money.The Â is a little-publicized bureau housed in a nondescript office building in Washington, D.C., where its officers answer to no one. Its secret mission is to oversee the national bank and its financial system, a vast apparatus that has provided all our leaders with a steady supply of cash and credit for the best part of the past century. Its mission is the secret to running the country.What do they say in their mission statement, published on its web site? "The central bank is the heart of the U.S. government. It controls the money supply to help finance government and promote economic vitality. It is independent of politics, serving the nation as a whole rather than the constituents of any specific political party. The Â is responsible for maintaining price stability and for safeguarding the nation's money."But that little-known central bank has a surprising mission: to ensure that the money it issues comes from safe and reliable sources. Its powers to print and distribute money have led to record inflation, bankruptcies, defaults and bank failures, the latter often triggered by the bank's failure to deliver on its money obligations. The Â has also taken on the roles of bank for Wall Street, insurance company for the financial sector and treasury for the Treasury Department.The Â has never had much to do with politics, but it has been a key player in the 2008 financial crisis. The government is now scrambling to restore confidence in its ability to manage the nation's money but needs to address a long-neglected legal question: Can it?It can.A lot of moneyBy the time the money supply had stabilized after the Great Depression, many people had come to accept the notion that government's role in regulating and controlling the money supply was a fiction. They assumed that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an independent agency, would play the same role. That, too, turned out to be bogus.The Â was formed the same year, in the midst of the Roaring '20s, a period of intense hyperinflation. Its first chairman	0
The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered. "I don't care about overpopulation in India ... I believe God has chosen us to be like this (have big families). Those who are born into this family don't want to leave this tradition so we just keep growing and growing," he says with a smile. Ziona, who only goes by his first name, has 39 wives, 86 children and 35 grandchildren. Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will. "I never wanted to get married but that's the path God has chosen for me," he says. "It's not my wish to keep marrying again and again." All 160 family members live in a four-storey mansion perched on top of a remote village in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram. The state, neighboring Myanmar and Bangladesh, has one million residents, one of the lowest population densities in this country of 1.2 billion. Despite its natural beauty, special permits are required to enter the state, making tourism virtually non-existent. Four hours away from Mizoram's only airport, in the isolated village of Baktwang, Ziona's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out. The main room is a giant hall where the family cooks, eats and prays. The bedrooms are dormitory-style with an average of 20 beds, each double bed about a foot apart from the next. The children sleep with their mothers who take turns visiting the 69 year-old's master bedroom. "There is no discrimination amongst us, he treats us all equally," fifth wife Twangi says. Ziona first got married when he was 17 to Zathiangi, who is now 70. His youngest wife is 31. As the eldest wife, Zathiangi calls all the shots in the kitchen so meal times are an efficient exercise. Without much fuss, while some women of the house cook, others set the table, still others serve and clean. "We cook 25 kilograms of rice, 40 kilograms of potatoes and 5 kilograms of lentils everyday," Twangi says. The family indulges in meat three times a week and for every non-vegetarian meal, 30 chickens are plucked and a giant pig is roasted.	1
Big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands, but a group of Dutch architects hope to change that with the "Park Supermarket" -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place. The firm behind the proposal, Rotterdam-based Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, intends to produce everything from risotto rice, to kiwis to Tilapia fish all on one 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Randstad, Holland's largest metropolitan area. In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way. The land, which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession, cuts across the city fringes of Rotterdam and The Hague, serving a potential customer-base of over one million people, according to Van Bergen Kolpa Architects. "The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes," said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the "Park Supermarket" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November. "The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical. Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses," he said. But how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north European city? According to van Bergen, it's not as far-fetched or futuristic as it sounds. "The main differences between a Mediterranean and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening, " he explained. "To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop," So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of "snake walls" and "climate pylons."	1
A top Mexican drug trafficker has been arrested by Mexican police, authorities said Wednesday. Luis Rodriguez Olivera, alias "El Guero," was arrested at Mexico City's airport Tuesday, federal police said in a statement. The United States was offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Rodriguez's capture. Rodriguez, 39, is accused of money laundering and importing, possessing and distributing cocaine into the United States. According to Mexico's Ministry of Public Security, Rodriguez and his brothers Esteban, Daniel and Miguel were part of a criminal ring known as Los Gueritos, who smuggled drugs into the United States between 1996 and 2008. The crew worked under the leadership of Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Of the other brothers, Esteban was arrested in 2008, and Miguel was killed in a shootout in August, the ministry said. The Rodriguez brothers were indicted in New York in 2009 for drug trafficking. The U.S. State Department offered the hefty reward for Luis Rodriguez's capture. While Mexican authorities said Wednesday that Rodriguez was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. officials offered a slightly different biography of the trafficker. According to American authorities, Rodriguez and his gang broke away from El Chapo's federation around 2005 and tried to work independently. Eventually, pressured by the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, the Rodriguez brothers moved their operations to Leon, Guanajuato, and established a strong relationship with the Zetas drug cartel. Rodriguez's arrest was the second important drug trafficking arrest made in two weeks. Last week, Mexican army special forces arrested a top lieutenant for El Chapo. Troops arrested Felipe Cabrera Sarabia in the northwestern state of Sinaloa. Cabrera, who was responsible for the activities of the Sinaloa cartel in Durango and the southern part of the state of Chihuahua, was detained after fleeing from Durango, officials said. He is charged with possessing firearms reserved for use by the army and falsification of a public document, officials said.	1
Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a "title, cover and all" ready for a book  on the topic.The final, and perhaps decisive, step in the process involves the judge's decision about the case's future, a process that is expected to end Friday, when a jury is selected. Anthony is accused of murdering her 3-year-old daughter Caylee in 2005 and faces the death penalty.According to information obtained by New York magazine, one of the prospective jurors said she would be "extremely biased" if she were chosen as a juror."I don't think there's a chance for me to be unbiased," she said."It's not that I can't be biased; I can be very biased and prejudiced," she said. "I would be more biased in her favor than against her."Another potential juror also said she is "very prejudiced," according to the magazine.The jury selection process continued after noon Saturday as the potential jurors were questioned by Judge Joseph Bianco, who repeatedly interrupted the process and the men and women tried to speak but were not able to.He also directed the court bailiffs to remove the potential jurors from the courtroom after repeated requests by them for more time. Many of the men and women who were trying to talk were yelling and yelling.The jury selection process is expected to end by about 1 p.m.All but one of the nine jurors that were struck by the court had been questioned by the court.Some of the jurors who were given a strike, including one who said they were not biased, have not yet been seated on the jury. Some of the other jurors who are seated have said they will be biased and prejudiced in Anthony's favor, according to New York magazine.According to the article, the eight jurors questioned to day by Bianco said they would not be biased and will not be swayed by emotional appeals made by prosecution lawyers."If I'm sitting on the jury, I will try to be impartial," one woman said and is likely to vote to convict Anthony, according to the magazine.As the jury selection process continued after noon, Bianco spoke with the potential jurors in the courtroom."Is there anyone here	0
President Richard M. Nixon and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici, in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile, according to a newly declassified document.  Nixon's offer made public earlier this month by Citizens for Nixon on the web site of the Nixon Presidential Library suggests Nixon's visit to Brazil that November was also an attempt to recruit a friendlier foreign policy partner.A number of Brazil's neighbors felt it was their duty to ensure Allende's government was brought down. Nixon's offer of support was rejected by the Brazilian government—part of a well publicized effort to isolate and discredit the Brazilian government.The United States helped the Chilean government to set up an international spy network against Allende, which provided the U.S. with information about the latter's activities, and provided training for Chilean agents.Nixon's Brazil visit followed a visit to Chile by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, who was the first democratically elected government in Latin America to lose a rigged election. Nixon had publicly encouraged Aylwin's election as "a great example for the rest of the hemisphere to follow."  Following Nixon's visit to Chile, Aylwin was sent a letter by Nixon recommending that he not be re-elected in the 1964 election. Nixon had also urged Aylwin to remain neutral in the upcoming election between Allende and socialist candidate Salvador Allende in Chile. Aiding and abetting Allende's re-election would not have been good for the American image around the world.The book Nixonworld: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America was published in 2012, by HarperCollins. The book was the winner of the 2012 National Book Award for nonfiction.ReceptionNixon's book was widely praised by the American literary establishment, and its book club was selected by the New York Review of Books as a best book of the year.ReferencesExternal links Category:2012 non-fiction booksCategory:Non-fiction books about the Watergate scandalCategory:Works about Richard NixonCategory:Books about politics of the United StatesCategory:Books about the Salvador Allende governmentCategory:HarperCollins booksCategory:United States presidential trips	0
A Georgia man was alone before his fatal fall from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field, police said Tuesday, as they continue to investigate his death. Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against Â¬Â¬Â¬St. Louis when he fell from the second level of the ballpark, according to an Atlanta Police Department spokesman.Homer was taken to Emory University Hospital, where he died from his injuries. Officials did not immediately say how he fell.Police Chief George Turner said later Tuesday that the incident was not a suicide. Instead, he said, it appears that Homer could have been intentionally struck by the falling ball."I have to say there are several things that were contributing to the fall. He was alone. He was not wearing a safety belt," Turner said. "He was not wearing a helmet. And he was not wearing a seatbelt."Turner said a witness alerted police about the incident about 9:45 p.m. to say that Homer was falling from the upper level of the stadium. The witness said that in his 20 years as a Braves fan, he had never seen anything like the event.Investigators said they initially thought that Homer had jumped off the stadium by simply turning around in mid-leap. But police said they have since interviewed witnesses and discovered evidence that could help establish that it was actually more serious.Turner said the victim was wearing black shoes, a black pullover sweater and black pants, but no socks."A lot of times when people do not wear or do not wear things that are appropriate, it can get to the point where somebody gets hurt. So, we are doing everything we can to learn more," he said.In an emotional scene at Turner Field, the Braves put on t-shirts with Homer's initials, as well as one with a picture of the man. They also handed out copies of a letter from the man."Our thoughts and prayers are with Ronald's family as they process this tragic loss," team president John Schuerholz said in a statement. "Our organization is committed to supporting them as they seek justice for their loss."Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, noting that the Braves and its fans are "justifiably proud of the city, the region and the baseball team,"	0
Maram scrunches up her little nose and pauses as she remembers. The eight-year-old was daddy's favorite. "When he was going to work he was shot," she says. By whom, no one can say for sure, but Syria's merciless war does not differentiate between combatant and civilian -- and it is leaving behind countless children like Maram who have lost one or both parents along with their innocence. "I saw him when they brought him to the house when he was dead," Maram continues. "I said 'God have mercy on you' and I prayed." She has an inquisitive, heart-shaped face. She listens intently to our questions, and often stops to think before answering. "I would see him in my dreams, I would see him giving someone something or taking someone somewhere. I used to see him, but now I don't anymore." She is one of around 34 children between the ages of two and 10 who live during the week at the Beyti Orphanage in southwest Turkey, near the Syrian border. Their fathers are all dead -- some lost to illness and some, like Maram's dad, to the violence consuming Syria. Their mothers, refugees in Turkey, can't afford to properly clothe and feed them. At Beyti there is bath time, fresh clothes, and beds to sleep on. There are toys to replace those that the children had to leave behind, regular hot healthy meals, and clean water to wash with. Maram and her friend Mohammed whisper next to me on the couch. He pulls a tie out of his pocket. "Someone was giving them out," he explains. The pair erupt in giggles as Maram tries to put it on him. Her father had taught her how to tie the knot, but she doesn't really remember. "Are you guys best friends?" I ask. "We're not friends, we're siblings," Mohammed replies. Maram looks at me, her eyes open wide, and she smiles. "He considers himself my brother," she tells me. "We're all family here," another child pipes in. The Beytin Orphage, which opened in September, was established by the Maram Foundation. It was named not the little girl we met, but for another of the same name who was paralyzed from the waist down by a shrapnel wound to her spine.	1
A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity. Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July. She  had been raised as a Muslim. The family is refusing to take her to court for conversion because they say what she is doing is allowed in her religion.Columbus police say the girl is going to be charged with three counts of unlawful confinement.Here's a recent report on the family's religious objections.http://www.wchealthnews.com/news/society/2010/01/18/man-caught-threatening-bitch-for-converting-from-muslim-to-christian/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1458344/Man-Caught-threatening-bitch-for-converting-Muslim-Christian.htmlhttp://www.fox19.com/news/local/man-caught-threatening-bitch-for-converting-to-christian-after-she-spent-10-budAnd here is a story about a child who was given a choice when his parents caught him converting from Islam:http://www.lohud.com/news/nation/2010-01-18/bob-murdoch-defends-son-choice-converting-from-islamAccording to the Washington Post,A teenager from northern Ohio has been ordered to undergo sex-change surgery under the guise of a religious freedom claim, but the man who had his son killed in a church shooting claims he was killed only to "teach a lesson" and for being a practicing homosexual. Rifqa Bary's mother, Syreen Bary, refused to accept the surgery, as Muslims generally do, and now she is suing the boy's father, Sami Bary, for his wrongful death. She said that he had converted to Christianity as a result of her son's actions, and if he were not so stubborn, Sami Bary would be alive today. According to the Associated Press, "Bary, who is in his early 20s and was born on February 11, 1987, was not present at the shooting in September 2002, during his son	0
The Republican Senate primary in Mississippi had long been in the spotlight over nasty politics, but events just prior, during and now after the vote have placed the race in its own unusual category. Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel squared off months ago in what was viewed as a potential bellwether between the larger fight taking place nationally between the arch conservative tea party and establishment Republicans. It was cast as youth and fresh ideas against veteran incumbency and politics as usual. Spending was up, ads were intense, and the vote was expected to be close. The general election was considered pro forma in the reliably Republican state. This primary would decide who would go to Washington. But late in the game, things took a bizarre turn and have gotten more complicated since the June 3 primary resulted in a runoff, which Cochran won three weeks later. Here are the five most unusual moments: 1. Dirty tricks: In May, three tea party supporters and apparent allies of McDaniel were arrested for conspiring to photograph Cochran's bedridden wife in a hospice in an apparent case of political dirty tricks. Rose Cochran suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years. The photo of her surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran, The Mississippi Clarion-Ledger reported. McDaniel's campaign denied any connection to the matter. Then, after the runoff, one of those charged with conspiracy in the photo scandal, Mark Mayfield, died in an apparent suicide at his home. It remains under investigation. 2. Crying foul: Separated by less than 1,500 votes following the primary with McDaniel ahead, the two then turned their attention to a runoff won by Cochran with a narrow, but more comfortable margin of nearly 7,000 votes. McDaniel has cried foul and won't concede.

Firefighters early Thursday extinguished a massive blaze that scorched the exterior of a 40-story apartment building in Grozny, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. No one was killed or injured but dozens were evacuated from the skyscraper and nearby buildings, RIA Novosti said of the fire in the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya. It quoted a spokesman for the republic's emergencies service. RIA Novosti said preliminary information indicated the fire was caused by a short circuit. Plastic trimming on the exterior was destroyed. The building's interior was untouched, according to the news agency. Wednesday, officials told CNN that no one was living at the building at the time of the fire. It was not clear whether those evacuated were workers or others temporarily in the building. Most of the floors of the building -- the largest in Chechnya, and built just a few years ago, according to RIA Novosti -- were on fire, a police source told the news agency. More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze.	1
Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks played a role in the surprise ending of a domestic assault case in Los Angeles, according to defense attorney Andrew Flier. Hanks had been serving as a juror in the trial since it started last week. Flier's client was facing up to a year in jail and the attorney was prepared to offer closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. Instead, as proceedings wrapped Tuesday, the prosecuting attorney revealed that another lawyer in the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office had interacted with Hanks outside the courtroom, thanking him for his service. As a result, Flier asked the court for a mistrial, citing prosecutorial misconduct. In a hearing on Wednesday morning, lawyers on both sides of the case convened and settled on a reduced charge for the defendant: disturbing the peace and a $150 fine. City Attorney's Office spokesperson Frank Mateljan confirmed the interaction with Hanks, saying, "The city attorney has been appraised of the situation and will be reviewing it." CNN reached out to representatives for Hanks for comment, but has not heard back. The alleged victim's reaction to the resolution was unavailable. Prosecutors do not identify those who makes claims of domestic violence, and the parties involved have made no public statement, Mateljan said. Flier said he was initially concerned that having a Hollywood star on the jury would unfairly influence the case's outcome. "I think because of his celebrity status and because of his personality, I think (the jury) would have followed him." But after interviewing Hanks in jury selection, Flier decided he was a good fit for the final slot on the jury. "He never looked or made any statements like he wanted to get off jury duty. So based on everything, he seemed like a very fair juror," Flier said. Hanks' appearance didn't only affect proceedings inside the courtroom. Flier said the star also drew quite a crowd of photographers and fans outside the courthouse afterward. "Everyone was taking photographs. He was smiling. He welcomed anybody," Flier said. If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted. "He looked at me like he always had, smiled and said, 'I was going to vote the way of justice.' So he never disclosed what that justice was headed for, the defense or the prosecution." CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.	1
You've got to save your best leadership for home." These are the words of retired U.S. Army Commander Lt. General Russel L. Honore at a recent speaking event on leadership in the 21st century. Two nights ago, I found my two most active roles in life -- family man and journalist -- intersecting in a crisis. It was 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon when my wife alerted me. I was enjoying my afternoon off, comfortable in the warmth of our home, watching the snow from a rare winter storm blanket our deck and backyard. My wife, who is a fifth-grade school teacher in Fulton County, Georgia, received word that her school was shutting down because of the inclement weather. "Honey I've got the kids. I'm on my way home," she said after school was dismissed early, and parents were rushing to get their children. As a journalist, I recognized that a news story was breaking before me. My wife's normal 20-minute daily commute was about to turn into an ordeal that would last nearly 24 hours. And I soon discovered that skills honed over years in the newsroom, were my best tools for assisting my wife and children. More than three hours later, she still hadn't moved very far. We stayed in constant contact as she inched along the 6-mile stretch of state highway leading her home. From the news, I soon realized this was no ordinary traffic jam. My family was stuck in gridlocked traffic caused by a one-two-punch of bad weather and poor government planning. Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m. The half-tank of gas she started with that afternoon had dwindled, and temperatures were well-below freezing. The kids hadn't eaten. There was no restroom in sight. I felt hopeless and helpless. I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles. I wanted to know how my family was going to be helped. They told me, "We don't know sir. We're trying, but we are out-manned now."	1
Twelve photographers from four continents have been shortlisted for the Overseas Press Club's prestigious First Prize for Non-Fiction – the most prestigious award for journalists covering humanitarian affairs and development issues.The winner will receive over €70,000 ($100,000) and an international exhibition at which to demonstrate their abilities.The prize is awarded by the Overseas Press Club under the patronage of the Queen and former world record holder Usain Bolt. The prize is named after Usain Bolt because he believed “it is the duty of every person, in whatever country they may come, to contribute to the common good.”The prize gives the winner the opportunity to showcase the use of photography as a powerful news and political tool to tell the stories of people living in the most difficult circumstances.This year's jury judges selected the shortlisted photographers from 45 applications from 35 countries including Australia, New Zealand, England, France, Japan and Germany.“This year we were very excited and proud to have a number of entries from countries throughout the world. Everyone was an amazing photographer with many exciting work on display. From this collection we're thrilled to announce the winner!” said Jo Ann Lutcher, Chair of the Overseas Press Club and Editor-in-Chief of the Overseas Press Club Journal.“The Overseas Press Club has a great history of supporting photographers as they work to tell their stories to the world.

You're a mean one, Mr. Gingrich. Well, not really. Those of us who know Newt Gingrich tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming. Some members of the Washington press corps will admit as much, even though they  still think he is a nasty person, a man who will tell you where to plant a lawn.If his campaign has one distinguishing feature, it is that it is the most sophisticated campaign run by an out-of-power politician since the last one in 1974.In the days before his defeat in South Carolina, Gingrich's campaign operation felt like a ship at sea, with a single sail caught in a whirlwind. The ship was a collection of more than 1,000 people all doing their own things, from the time they wake up in the morning to the time they retire for the night. The crew was an unruly motley mix of staffers with a lot of different skills and backgrounds -- from the traditional political operation to the media in-house and those who were on their way from other countries.A lot of the people in his own inner circle worked at the campaign until they were persuaded, by Newt's own admissions, that he should be president. They worked on it as if he were still in the Senate, often taking the lead role in a campaign in which they were not the chief executive.It was a campaign from the ground up and, as it developed, the campaign was in an increasingly difficult environment, for which the campaign was largely responsible. At points, the campaign had to make a major decision. It had to choose between attacking Gingrich as a flip-flopper and continuing to attack him as an extremist. At times, the campaign had to make a choice between running against Gingrich on his record of failure and running against Gingrich as a serial philanderer and drug user.It was a campaign from the  ground up, not at the top, as it had been in the past.He was on the road only a tiny part of the time. The campaign office was in Washington, D.C. and was a place where people who worked there felt they would soon be moving to. For months, there was virtually no contact between Mr. Gingrich and his campaign staff.The campaign was in such a state of disarray that the press was frequently asked to write stories that they felt would be damaging to Mr. Gingrich, and then asked to retract	0
Mitch Hurwitz has good news for "Arrested Development" fans. "I'm working on the movie right now," the show's creator tells Rolling Stone. "I can't get into much more detail because I don't want to  spoil everything, but I'm in the process of being a father. And I'm a father to a baby, and she's going to be a father to a baby. There's a lot of stuff I'm working on that I can't talk about much at the moment."Hurtwitz, who is producing through his Monkey Wrench Productions and exec-producing through ABC Studios, is also taking an early interest in "Arrested Development's" upcoming fourth season. "I was hoping to do another season this year, but we're still working through the process," he says. "It's hard to tell exactly when we're going to show up or when we're going to start shooting. The show is in the middle of a huge undertaking of being able to finish it. I'm working at the moment to find some writers to finish the last four episodes.""Arrested Development" has already done plenty of work on the last four episodes. Hurwitz says the only "Arrested Development" film he is not involved with is "Gabe and the Giant Pool of Blood," which was written by the show's cast, but is awaiting final release. In fact, he doesn't even plan on getting a call to come and help "Arrested Development" finish its season. "I might go to Sundance," he says. "I might bring something to Sundance to see if it can get screened, but I don't know if we'll get much of a chance there."He's also not quite sure if he'll be working with Mitch Hedberg, the show's beloved and quirky star (and, to a degree, star maker). He hopes to, though says "I've seen some of his stuff and he's great. I've tried to be nice to him and kind, and I've seen a lot of his stuff from 'The Simpsons' movies. And he's doing 'Arrested Development' right now, so we'll see what he's doing."Hurwitz also says that he'd like to see the show continue to evolve. "I don't have much of an interest in expanding it into a TV series," he says. "	0
Even when Chelsea held a nine-point lead over Manchester City atop English football's Premier League, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho always maintained his team wasn't the favorite. He is being proved right -- with iced-coffee victories in three finals in six seasons."The most important thing for us in these finals is the quality of the players," he says. "We must make sure we have the quality we need... To lose, for us, it is not a final, it's a tie, but we are going against Manchester City."He goes on to predict a "miracle-turn" for Chelsea in the title campaign, citing new signings, a deep run in the cups and the return of former Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole."There is a lot of quality in our squad. The players who will help us in these finals are the players on the bench," says Mourinho, an eight-time winner in English club finals, including a win over Chelsea in 1980."We're not a team lacking in confidence. We know we have a strong squad, a strong team spirit, we are playing in a team that has strong quality."We played well in the beginning of 2013 and in the last two seasons. But we have to improve. And it is no secret that we improved a lot in the last two seasons. We lost a lot of points. But these are the four finals, it is difficult to lose points for losing many."Mourinho is in the process of finding more of the back-to-form players of old. He signed Diego Costa and David Luiz, and has brought in Florent Malouda and Tiemoue Bakayoko."We have to find an additional player, a strong, talented central midfielder." The Spaniard has been in splendid form. "He has a quality, he has a certain personality and he's a player I believe in."Lloris, who was in the starting lineup until last weekend, has been in fine form over the club's last four games. And Mourinho believes goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been brilliant this season and will be key to Chelsea's success.The Frenchman has kept 13 clean sheets in the Premier League since the start of the 2012-13 season, and has made five saves over two games in the Champions League for Chelsea."He is a great goalkeeper,	0
The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's. It was an especially dark and foggy Friday night, and rescuers were having a hard time figuring out the location of iced-over terrain. They knew the plane crashed in the tundra, but there was no road. So they couldn't find that out. They also knew the plane was carrying a lot of equipment — fuel, for one — but where that was was a mystery.The first team of rescuers pulled up, got out of the helicopter and saw all the equipment on the plane. It took them hours to sort everything, since the pilot had gotten his eyes off the sky while approaching the crash site. They had to do a lot of guesswork, and they were frustrated with their work.Eventually they found the black-and-white plane, a small propeller-powered aircraft built by the British Aircraft Corporation. It was a popular trainer. It had an amateur radio license. It had been flying for more than a decade, and there were records it flew regularly. It had been certified by the FAA to fly for 100 miles at 50 knots. It was also certified for taking a passenger.This was an American-made plane, and it would take the pilots a while to figure out what had happened, and how they could recover their airplane."It probably was flying just under instrument flight rules at this point," one rescuer said. I asked him how long they thought the plane was flying."I would guess they were flying for a couple of hours or a day."We flew to Alaska, flew out of the airport in Bethel, and then flew along with one of those aircraft. It had wings painted on it, but they were not painted or marked in a way that the pilots could read them. We flew for three hours and we saw the planes fly overhead, at first over and then off to the side of the airport. We saw the pilots flying on a compass course and we saw them change course.At first there was a radio transmitter attached to the airplane, and then we got more close. We flew over a little house with a big red flag sitting on the roof and it looked like it was flying over the house.The plane was flying at about 20,000 feet. The radio transmitter was on its nose.

Described as the largest single gathering of displaced residents in the world today, tens of thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu, according to the United Nations. Members of ÂMoral Support and Protection Unit' are reporting that over a thousand displaced Somalis have arrived at the border with Kenya and Ethiopia.There are reports of many people fleeing from the terror of the war and having fled to neighboring countries. In fact, many of the displaced are from the same neighbourhood and are being held at the same building on the main street.Residents living near the front line report people fleeing the war and are being fed by aid groups who have already organized large scale food distributions. Many are also reportedly being held in camps for the displaced in areas adjacent to the front line.The front line is between the towns of Hawlwad and Garowe. The Somali government will have to take responsibility for the refugees, whose presence is not sanctioned by Somalia's constitution. Those who flee to Kenya are a problem for the country already, as they provide a safe haven for the Al-Shabaab terrorist group.The U.N. Security Council has been meeting to discuss the situation in Somalia for several months now. The latest report from the U.N. refugee agency in Kenya said, "About 15,000 Somalis were displaced when the fighting began in the south, more than half of them in Garowe."The Somali government's response has been largely to simply ignore the issue. In fact, Somalia is reportedly the only country in Africa that has not signed a peace agreement with the government. In fact, the Somalis reportedly refuse to abide by the peace agreement signed in late February.The government has been accused of not providing emergency assistance to the people who are fleeing, as well as refusing to allow aid workers and representatives of the United Nations to enter Somalia.The reports of people fleeing from war and being taken into Kenya provide a new challenge to the government and the peace process. They also reveal a different reality. It is the civilians who find themselves at the front line, who are also at risk, and for whom the peace agreement isn't even a viable option.MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - Thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu as another round of conflict rages in the country's	0
South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years. The news iced the cake on a day when the sport’s governing body was fighting a fresh battle with South African officials over financial issues in world rankings and tournaments.The five-year deal also will allow the event to be held in South Africa if needed, but guarantees to have the right to host the event in 2023.“It’s great news for South Africa and great news for golf in South Africa,” said South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa after the announcement was made by the IOC, which had given the country the right to host the annual event in 2022.“The World Championships is on the up as a competition. We want to make sure that we’re hosting it well, and we’ve made a commitment to the host country and, of course, to the people of South Africa.”South Africa were bidding for the 2022 event over fellow country Jordan, and were considered favorites for the lucrative event, including with players such as Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Sergio Garcia and Ernie Els.However, the host nation was forced to drop their candidature as it received a letter from the International Olympic Committee, citing a lack of financial guarantees.“When you look at the World Championships, and the fact that we have to pull out, and if you look at the fact that we’ve lost the WGC, you will see that we are not the favourite anymore,” said Nelsie Viljoen, the chair of golf’s board of directors.“We were told very clearly that the host countries would have to go above and beyond financially to ensure the successful return of the championships and the positive impact they have on the games.“We haven’t done that. We’ve tried to, but we’ve gone for the short term.”While there was some good news for the sport in one sense, it came at the expense of financial certainty, a situation that has plagued the sport for many years.South Africa’s first-ever major championship, the Open Championship in 1999, will be in April on the southern tip of Africa	0
Two days after an embarrassingly early European Champions League exit, Manchester United have been dealt a further blow with the news that club captain Nemanja Vidic will miss the rest of this season. The defender was stretchered off during Wednesday's 2-1 defeat to Basel in Switzerland, a result which saw last season's finalists exit Europe's premier club competition at the group stage for the first time in six years. The Serbia international has ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee, and manager Alex Ferguson said the 30-year-old will see a specialist on Monday to reveal the full extent of the injury. "We thought it was a bad one," the Scot told reporters on Friday. "He's out for the season. It's not unexpected but it's still bad news." The 19-time English champions are second in the Premier League, five points behind arch-rivals Manchester City ahead of Saturday's home match against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vidic's injury limits United's options in central defense, with experienced England international Rio Ferdinand to partner Northern Ireland's Jonny Evans or one of versatile young duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. "He'll see a specialist on Monday to work out the progress of when he has the operation," confirmed Ferguson. "It won't be immediate as we have to let the swelling come down. "We'll now have to choose between Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. I thought Rio had his best game of season on Wednesday. His experience will be vital." Vidic is part of a growing injury list at Old Trafford, with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez also sidelined after damaging an ankle during last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa. Midfielders Anderson and Tom Cleverley, Brazilian twins Fabio and Rafael da Silva, and veteran striker Michael Owen are also out. However, Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov could return for Saturday's clash with Mick McCarthy's 16th-placed Wolves.	1
ALS has no survivors.  Zero. The disease is an incurable -- let's change that -- progressive degenerative neurological disorder.  For reasons that are still not completely understood, the nerve cells in my brain and spinal cord will gradually deteriorate. I will ultimately lose the ability to move, speak, swallow and finally breathe.  ALS leads to complete paralysis.  The average life expectancy is two to five years.  Shit. This is not fun to talk about! I have what is called familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Only 5% to 10% of ALS patients have this genetic disposition.  My grandmother Marie was diagnosed when I was in middle school.  She passed away six years later.  My mother, Catherine, was diagnosed when I was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years.  Although most of my mom's muscles have atrophied away, she's the longest living ALS patient in her clinic.  She is the most beautiful and inspirational person you will ever meet. Four years ago, I graduated from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles and moved back home to help care for my mom.  I started a wedding photography business.  I photographed weddings on the weekends and would help my mom during the weekdays while my stepfather was at work.  I was fulfilling two passions:  photographing 40+ weddings a year and spending much needed quality time with my mom.  I loved it! But then my hands, arms and shoulders started getting weak.  I was carrying camera equipment all day, and it became increasingly more difficult to change settings and hold up my camera.  After a wedding, I felt like I was hit by a bus.  I was so incredibly exhausted, and it took my body a long time to recuperate.  I thought I was just overdoing it, but realized I couldn't ignore the symptoms anymore. On January 27, 2014, at 26 years old, I was diagnosed with ALS.	1
The lawsuit against Porsche related to the fiery crash that killed actor Paul Walker suffered a setback in court, but a lawyer says it will go on. Roger Rodas' widow is suing that carmaker's North American branch, claiming negligence and a poor design of the high-powered Porsche Carrera GT caused the crash last November. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez dismissed four of the five grounds for the lawsuit, finding that the complaint did not include enough specifics. Rodas can revive the arguments by amending her lawsuit, Gutierrez said in an order filed in federal court Monday. "He only granted a partial dismissal with leave to amend, which we will," Rodas lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN Tuesday. Kristine Rodas filed the suit against Porsche Cars North America in May, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old "Fast and the Furious" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California. She also alleged product liability and wrongful death. The only allegation that was not dismissed was the "strict liability claim" regarding the lack of a crash cage and racing fuel cell for the high-performance car. The Rodas lawsuit contends that a "properly functioning crash cage" would have prevented the deaths by preventing "intrusion into the passenger compartment," damage to the fuel tank, and the splitting of the vehicle in half. Read the judge's full decision here Roger Rodas, 38 at the time of his death, spent his competitive racing career driving Porsche cars. According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor. A few years later the two men formed the racing team Always Evolving Racing, where they were both drivers. "Although Mr. Rodas had a passion for cars, Mr. Rodas was first and foremost dedicated to his family, his wife, Kristine, and their two young children," the complaint states. The court documents filed by Kristine Rodas describe the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that her husband was driving as a an "ultra-high-performance-super-sports car for the road," that goes from zero to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 205 miles per hour. The complaint argues that such a high-powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection, and that a mechanical malfunction forced Rodas to veer off the road.	1
While the horrors inflicted by the Nazis during World War II are well documented, "Defiance" director Edward Zwick wanted to make sure the stories of those who fought back aren't overlooked. Liev Schreiber, left, and Âme co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan talk during an interview in Toronto on Feb. 3, 2014."I've been studying history ever since I was a kid, because I always had a lot of books around me," explains film director Edward Zwick, who was behind the movie "Defiance."At age 5, he was inspired by reading Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech in front of his class. "I was totally fascinated with his dream, which is that America is the answer to the question of world peace," he says."One of the reasons I really got into the film business was to make films that spoke to the American public and I figured that if you could do that, you could make a difference."Zwick created a documentary of a civil rights movement at the University of Georgia that has gained international attention over the past decade: the 2007 "Defiance" was the second-highest-grossing film in America for its first weekend of release, and the movie's director says the civil rights movement movement is the most important piece of history in decades."This is what the country is about," Zwick says. "It's not just about black and white Americans. We are an American culture and society, and as such, we are at our best as people when we celebrate our diversity. ""What I love about this movie is that it's not just an entertainment piece. They're talking about real people, and the movie talks about real people trying to get justice, and it's that sort of justice that we need in America today, especially in a time of fear.""I thought they were a good group of people and they had a good sense of where they were," says director Steven Spielberg, who received an Emmy nomination for casting the movie."One big reason why the civil rights movement was so important was because it gave us a chance at healing the country. And right now we're living in such terrible divisions – we're tearing ourselves apart, so why not have a civil rights movement that brings us all together?"The film is the story of the three-day march from Sel	0
Classic rock band Cheap Trick got a scare Sunday night at the Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest. The stage iced up and a man in a cowboy hat stood next to a group of people for quite a while and would not leave. The group of people that stood next to the man were fans, and they tried to talk to the man on the stage and tried to take pictures of him, but he wouldn't do anything. Eventually the stage staff came over and told the man that he was going to be arrested if he didn't leave the stage. He finally left and came back around but the iced stage was gone. The stage staff said he may have put snow on it.Cheap Trick is back! Just in time for the end of the touring season and all the great shows that are happening this week! The band will be playing tonight at the Ottawa Bluesfest with the band The Riff Raff. Tickets will go on sale Friday at noon at Ticketmaster.ca, and you can pre-order your tickets now at the Ottawa Bluesfest website. And please come see the band if you can, they are great live!It is my sincere hope that this will be short lived, and please, if you have tickets to the show tonight, please buy them now, because the show is sold out, and they don't want to fill the venue, and, if you don't buy the tickets now, you risk being left holding a bad buy, and I will be sad. If you haven't seen the band live, please come out to Ottawa to see them live and hopefully they can make this short lived.Also for all you Ottawa fans, please come out and support local artists! It is hard to get tickets to shows when they are sold out, and it is not fair to those fans who want to be at a show, to be left out when the rest of the fans want tickets. Please support local Ottawa artists, including: The Dandy Warhols, The Riff Raff, The Burden Brothers, Hot Tuna, The Wild Ponies, The Great White, The Stereo Mufflers and the band The Wrecking Crew.I don't say I'm upset, I think its great that they are going for more shows in Ottawa, and, if you have not seen them live, you should definitely come out to see them tonight. They have been amazing, so well done Cheap Trick.	0
President Obama said in an interview aired Sunday that the hardest decision he's made since taking office was to send more troops to Afghanistan. In a "60 Minutes" interview, President Obama said, "I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney." Also in the interview on CBS' "60 Minutes," Obama defended his decision to shut down the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,  and he countered criticism from former vice president Dick Cheney. "I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney -- not surprisingly," Obama said. "I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we can't reconcile our core values, our Constitution, our belief that we don't torture, with our national security interests. I think he's drawing the wrong lesson from history." Obama was responding to comments Cheney made to CNN's "State of the Union" on March 15, when he said the president is making the nation less safe by closing the Guantanamo prison and ending interrogation practices that Bush administration critics consider torture for terror suspects. Just a month into office, Obama ordered 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the "war on terrorism" sparked by the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. "I think it's the right thing to do. But it's a weighty decision because we actually had to make the decision prior to the completion of the strategic review that we were conducting," Obama said. Coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of AIG, Obama said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation. Obama joked that even if Geithner were to tender his resignation, the president would tell him, "Sorry buddy, you've still got the job." Geithner has come under fire over the $165 million in bonuses AIG paid its top executives after the insurance giant received more than $170 billion in federal bailout money. A loophole in the recently approved economic stimulus bill, included at the behest of the Treasury, allowed AIG to pay the bonuses. "It's going to take a little bit more time than we would like to make sure that we get this plan just right," Obama said. The president also stressed that his administration won't endorse a House bill that would levy a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that receive bailout money.	1
My son Jason Rezaian and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in Iran more than 200 days ago. Since then, he has been languishing in a jail with no firm trial date in sight. Our patience has been exhausted. It is time to release my son or let him face a fair trial. Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was taken with his wife, Yeganeh, from their apartment on July 22. Jason, a dual Iranian-American citizen, has been at Evin Prison, held on suspicion of somehow posing a security risk to Iran. Yeganeh was released in early October, and through November she was permitted three phone calls and two visits each week. But last month, she was only permitted one brief visit. In a meeting December 22 with two members of Jason and Yeganeh's interrogation team, I was informed: "The West has an unfair view of us (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard). We do not rape, we do not torture; we do not waterboard. We are not Guantanamo. ... We do everything by Islamic, true Islamic law." When I visited my son in Evin on Christmas Day, he told me: "I will be a model prisoner if I am granted my rights under Islamic law. Rights attributed to Imam Ali, a fair and just man. And I don't believe I've been granted any of them: the right to meet with my attorney, my trial scheduled in a timely manner, and visitation rights with my wife." Following my trip, Iranian newspapers -- moderate and hard-line alike -- highlighted that I had met with Jason twice. Last weekend, in Munich, Germany, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on his role in that process. But while I sincerely appreciate Zarif's "humanitarian" efforts, as well as the orchestrating of Jason's one telephone call to me for Thanksgiving Day, the fact is that as a dual citizen and therefore Iranian mother, it is my right to visit my son in prison. In fact, in the early months, I was told the Iranians were asking Jason, "Where is your mother?" when I wasn't there all the time because they are so accustomed to seeing mothers waiting outside the prison gates. Yet in January, I was given no assurances of permission for further visits.	1
Republican presidential front-runner Sen. John McCain on Thursday defended his statement that U.S. troops could spend "maybe 100" years in Iraq -- saying he was referring to a military presence similar to what the nation already has in places like Japan, Germany and South Korea. Sen. John McCain defends his stance on troops in Iraq Thursday on CNN's "Larry King Live." This week, Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama both took McCain to task for the comments, saying that if he's elected he would continue what they call President Bush's failed policies in Iraq. "It's not a matter of how long we're in Iraq, it's if we succeed or not," McCain said to CNN's Larry King. "And both Sen. Obama and Clinton want to set a date for withdrawal -- that means chaos, that means genocide, that means undoing all the success we've achieved and al Qaeda tells the world they defeated the United States of America. "I won't let that happen." Last month, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire, a crowd member asked McCain about a Bush statement that troops could stay in Iraq for 50 years. "Maybe 100," McCain replied. "As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, it's fine with me and I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training, recruiting, equipping and motivating people every single day." The remaining Democratic contenders for the White House seized on the statement.  Watch McCain talk about Mitt Romney's endorsement and his critics on the right » "He said recently he could see having troops in Iraq for 100 years," Clinton said at an Arlington, Virginia, rally last week in a line she's repeated on the campaign trail. "Well, I want them home within 60 days of my becoming president of the United States." Obama took a similar tack. "Sen. McCain said the other day that we might be mired for 100 years in Iraq -- which is reason enough not to give him four years in the White House," Obama has said on several occasions. McCain told King he thinks opponents are taking the quote out of context. He said any long-term troop presence in Iraq would depend on agreement from the Iraqi government.	1
After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, "Fashion Police" is going on an extended break. The  afternoon talk show was abruptly called off by ABC after the show received backlash for posting an expletive-laced "locker room" photo of one of the co-hosts, Candace Cameron Bure, and the word "pussy."The photo shows Bure, who has openly mocked transgender people on "Fashion Police," in a white dress, sitting next to male co-hosts Cameron Diaz and Nick Cannon. "The photo was a joke," Cameron said in a statement that also included the caption, "I'm not transgender."After Bure tweeted about the photo Sunday, she was temporarily suspended by the CBS Corporation. After the suspension, she tweeted: "The photo was taken at my locker room...I was NOT laughing or smiling..No one was offended nor did anyone get offended. It was a joke." She added, "This was an honest mistake and I am sorry for the damage this has caused."Since being suspended by CBS (and, according to Deadline, potentially losing her contract and job), Bure has tweeted a series of apologies. "I am an actress, I can laugh at myself," she tweeted shortly after the photo was posted, and she followed up by saying,"I'm sorry for my inappropriate jokes."The original photoAfter a series of tweets where Bure appeared to be making fun of transgender people, Twitter users responded with outrage. One user asked if the photo was "pornographic?" Another asked: "How do we know it wasn't taken in a women's restroom?" Even conservative Fox News personality Todd Starnes questioned the photo, calling it "disturbing and disgraceful.""Fashion Police" co-host Candace Cameron Bure.CBS declined to comment about the photo. They did confirm that Cameron Bure is still a network host despite the photo. "Fashion Police" also did not make a statement about the reason for its abrupt cancellation, which took place in the wake of the backlash to Bure's tweet.On the surface, the photo seems to be a joke about Bure's hair. In a video of the photo posted to Facebook on Monday, she is shown with two male co-hosts, Cannon and Diaz, who are sporting long, thick hair	0
An Istanbul court slapped a world-renowned musician Monday with a 10-month suspended sentence for posting a series of tweets that poked fun at Islamic descriptions of heaven. Classical concert pianist Fazil Say, 43, was found guilty of "openly insulting the religious values held by a portion of the public" for the tweets, which were posted last year. "Although I am innocent and have not committed any crime, this decision I received is more worrisome for the freedom of expression and belief in Turkey than it is to me as a person," Say wrote in a statement posted on his Facebook page. The sentence marks a "very sad day for freedom of expression in Turkey," Say's lawyer Meltem Akyol told CNN. "We were expecting an acquittal." "Freedom of expression does not entitle you to condescend or offend or insult people," countered plaintiff Ali Emre Bukagili. "That's a crime." Say's tweets included: "You say the rivers will flow with wine, is heaven a tavern? You say each believer will receive two women, is heaven a brothel?" according to the indictment. In another, Say joked about the short duration of a cleric's traditional Islamic call to prayer. The tweet asked a rhetorical question to the chanting cleric: "What's the hurry? Lover waiting?" the indictment said. Say also was convicted of retweeting allegedly offensive posts, such as, "I am not sure if you have realized it, but where there is scum, a lowlife, a thief or a fool, s/he is always an Allahist. Is this a paradox?" Faruk Logoglu, deputy international affairs chairman of the nation's main opposition party, CHP, called the sentence a "new link in the long chain of assaults on the freedom of expression and freedom of conscience in Turkey." "This is shameful for Turkish democracy," he said. Say won't have to serve his sentence as long as he doesn't commit a similar crime within the next five years. "The decision is a correct one," said Bukagili. "In our laws, it is against the law to publicly insult a belief, and he did that." The case was filed last June after three plaintiffs lodged formal complaints.	1
The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday. Anders Behring Breivik raised his arm to deliver a defiant speech as the trial opened for the 22-year-old defendant in Oslo."We are just a small portion of a larger and more powerful nation," he said. "We must show that this can be done easily. We must show that we can do it."Breivik later left the courtroom after his defense lawyer submitted the case to the stand. Prosecutor Jens Stance Mathiesen was not present, and his two other prosecutors announced they would not give evidence during the opening statements, according to the Associated Press.Breivik, who is charged with murder and terror and is considered armed with terror-related material, said he is not guilty of the charges. But he insisted that his actions were "justified," and he said his actions were justified by a belief of "no less than divine providence.""I am a murderer, but I did it for a higher reason," Breivik said, according to Reuters.Norwegian police have said that the attacks, and Breivik's claim to be a martyr, are evidence that the attacks were inspired by Islam. "We have received an enormous amount of information in the last days, and it is becoming clearer and clearer that the attacks were a response to some kind of radical ideology," said Deputy Police Commander Asle Toke.A report released by the country's Police Security Service, which investigates terrorism, said Breivik was inspired by al Qaeda.Breivik, who was raised a Catholic, and his father, also named Anders Breivik, are both well-known on Norway's streets for their inflammatory speeches. But Breivik refused to admit that he is a terrorist, saying he wanted to "give free speech for my views."Breivik was arrested five days after the shootings in the seaside town of Hålogaland, in the country's far north, and was held in a mental hospital until his trial.The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday.

A dispute over natural gas supply flared Friday between Russia and Ukraine, even as a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine appeared to be taking hold. Both sides in the conflict have begun withdrawing their heavy weaponry from the front line of the conflict, in line with a peace deal agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, two weeks ago. There has also been a reduction in the fighting between the two sides, although some artillery fire can still be heard. But the ceasefire remains fragile. A spokesman for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko cited him as saying on Twitter: "We starting withdrawing only some of the heavy weaponry. Ukrainian military are ready to return the equipment to the front line any time." The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zacharchenko, said separatist forces there had withdrawn 90% of their heavy weapons. But he also warned that they reserved the right to return the weapons to the front line if authorities in Kiev did not keep their end of the bargain. A CNN team on the ground saw a small convoy of artillery, flying the yellow-and-blue flag of Ukraine, heading south out of the conflict zone Thursday. The separatists began the withdrawal of heavy weapons a couple of days earlier. Under the terms of the Minsk agreement, the two sides have until Monday to complete the withdrawal and create a buffer zone of at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) for heavy weapons. The Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire and the withdrawal. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said Friday that three Ukrainian troops had been killed and seven injured in the past 24 hours in continued clashes. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak warned that Russian energy giant Gazprom could cut the supply of natural gas to its neighbor in the coming days if payment is not received. Russia's Tass state news agency said that Gazprom confirmed receiving $15 million Friday in prepayment from Ukraine. But that is enough to pay for only a day's supply of natural gas, the news agency said. A meeting between the European Union, Russia and Ukraine is due to take place in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday to discuss gas supply to Ukraine. Russia has used gas as a weapon before, cutting off supplies to Ukraine three times in the past decade. A new dispute could affect the rest of Europe. About a third of the European Union's natural gas comes from Russia, and 15% flows through Ukraine.	1
A flurry of small earthquakes rumbling near the Mammoth Mountain Volcano, have been categorized as "volcanic unrest" by the United States Geological Survey. Nearly three dozen earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2.6 to 3.8 have swarmed the area, northeast of Fresno, California, over the last two days. Earthquake swarms in this region are not uncommon.  David Shelly, a seismologist with California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is "bigger than we've seen recently, but normal in the area."  He adds they are keeping a close eye on the movement, "but in the larger scheme of things, it's within in the range of activity over the last several decades." Mammoth Mountain is in an area called the Long Valley Caldera. The center of the caldera has been uplifting slowly over the last several decades and seismologists continuously monitor it.  "We think there is fluid coming up from the crust triggering the earthquakes," said Shelly. The last swarm of quakes from 1997 to 1998 produced over 2,500 earthquakes per week at its height, according to the USGS. Since then, the region has been relatively quiet. In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic-gas monitoring station on the mountain. It tracks gases that fluctuate with earthquake activity to better track the changes in real-time. The awareness level on the USGS website remains at green/normal.  Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last erupted about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS.	1
A powerful British media group is fighting new accusations that it illegally got information on members of the royal family and top politicians, after a lawmaker accused it of hacking. Police have information that "strongly suggests" that a private investigator targeted royals, lawmakers and high-level terrorist informers on behalf of Rupert Murdoch's News International, Labour lawmaker Tom Watson said in Parliament Wednesday. British media said the targets included former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Kate Middleton when she was dating Prince William, the second in line to the throne. They married in April. Buckingham Palace and Prince William's office at Clarence House both declined to comment. But London's Metropolitan Police told CNN Thursday it "has received a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy.... These allegations are currently being considered." News International rejected the accusation. "With regards to Tom Watson's specific allegations, we believe these are wholly inaccurate," the company told CNN Thursday, adding that it was cooperating with ongoing police investigations into phone hacking and had not been asked about the work of the private investigator Watson named in Parliament. But it said it was "well documented" that the investigator "worked for a whole variety of newspaper groups." Murdoch's media group, which owns the Sunday tabloid News of the World, has already apologized to a number of celebrities and offered them compensation after admitting it had their phones hacked. Actress Sienna Miller was among the victims, a British court ruling in June confirmed. A News of the World royal correspondent and a private investigator were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voice mails of members of the royal staff. But Watson named a different investigator Wednesday, undercutting the long-standing News International claim that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. The Metropolitan Police are conducting an investigation called Operating Weeting into the accusations of hacking by British media. They said Thursday the allegations they have received this year are "outside the remit of Operation Weeting." But Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday that a "police inquiry does not need terms of reference" and that police are "free to investigate the evidence and take that wherever it leads them." Murdoch's media empire encompasses the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, Fox News and Harper Collins publishers, as well as the Times and the Sun newspapers in London. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Carol Jordan and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.	1
A "pocket dial" mistake can result in an unwanted phone call, annoying for the recipient and potentially embarrassing to the caller. But a new study found a staggering number of those apparently accidental calls in New York City are made to emergency responders, jamming up 911 lines in a city that has prided itself on its ability to respond in a crisis. Nearly 4 million of those calls were made to the city's emergency call centers in 2010, according to a recent Winbourne Consulting report, commissioned by the city after a massive blizzard delayed first responders and left Mayor Michael Bloomberg open to criticism. That's more than one-third of some 11 million emergency calls made in New York each year, the study found, which was released Friday. Those calls were 19 seconds or less. Authorities determined that they were likely accidental and say unnecessary communications add an increased burden on emergency response systems. "The increased proliferation of cellular telephones has caused a dramatic increase in the number of accidental 911 calls made," the report said. In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission issued a report estimating that 70% of all 911 calls -- intentional or mistaken -- were made from wireless devices. The consulting firm recommended implementing a citywide information campaign to alert the public of the issue and to streamline systems between the police and fire departments, among other recommendations.	1
There are two Rick Santorums: The first one I might not agree with, but the second one truly scares me. "Santorum One" pushes for less government regulation for corporations and shrinking the federal government.  You  know the saying "corporations are people too?" They really are. There's no difference between a corporation and a person except  the amount of money they (and/or their shareholders) can spend or invest. As the economy moves  away from the capitalistic model of corporations and money, we will be increasingly beholden to corporations. And in the process, we will be forced to accept lower and lower worker and consumer standards at the hands of corporations. This is the way the system works currently. There are no "natural rights" or "civil rights" in the United States: "it's just the way it is".Santorum TwoThis is a guy I would certainly love to get behind with our presidential race. We are in a battle to control the economy and who owns it. He also has a plan for getting rid of the minimum wage and getting us to a "fair trade" bill. While I won't vote for him, I would certainly be happy to sit down with him. And I suspect I will be getting another chance to meet with him soon."When I see the people pouring over the fence, it looks to me like they're preparing for a revolution."- Eugene V. DebsRick Santorum is a true American-an American of the heart. He is pro-life, pro-family and pro-life values. He is pro-life because he believes that women should be able to have control of their bodies and have equal rights with men. He is pro-family because he considers marriage to be a covenant between a man and a woman. He is pro-family because he believes in the family - a father, a mother, a husband, and a wife. He is pro-family because he believes in the sanctity of marriage. He is pro-life because he believes strongly in the sanctity of life. He is pro-life because people have a right to life. He is pro-family because he believes in the family - a father, a mother, a husband, and a wife. He is pro-life because people have a right to life.

Mo Elleithee was a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign but he says his new job as communications director for the Democratic National Committee has nothing to do with his former boss' ills.“There's no particular connection between my new position and Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party except that my new position is a very important part of the overall communications strategy that is the core of the party’s future,” the Texas Democrat told me. “It just so happens that since I used to be her campaign manager I've been able to influence her policies, which have been very beneficial for the country.”For most of the 20 years he's been in politics, Elleithee was a campaign staffer and strategist for Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. He says he's worked for two Democratic presidential candidates, John Kerry and Al Gore, and at four Republican presidential campaigns: Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain. He did not work for George W. Bush.Election 2016I asked Elleithee why he felt the DNC needed someone from the Clinton campaign for its communications effort.“I don't think the DNC will find anyone more qualified than Hillary Clinton,” he said. “She's the only candidate who has done so much for the country. It just so happens that I've been able to influence her policies.”Elleithee's former role as campaign manager for Clinton prompted some Republicans to question whether he had been working with the White House.“The truth is that when Hillary Clinton was in the Senate, she was the only senator in American history to have not had her home life on the line for nearly three decades in the Senate,” said former Sen. Bob Bennett, a Nebraska Republican. “She just happened to be married to the president of the United States of America, and I don't think we should be surprised that she's having influence for good in the DNC.”But when asked whether he thought he would have to sign a nondisclosure pact, Elleithee said he had not done so.“I wouldn't have signed a nondisclosure agreement, because I'm not the most private person in the world,” he said. “Every day when I go into a meeting, I try to make	0
Kemba Smith Pradia voted for the first time in her life in Indianapolis city elections last fall. This year, she moved from Indiana to Virginia, a few months ahead of the November presidential election, in which Â she's polling a distant third, behind Donald Trump with 40% and Hillary Clinton with 39%. She is one of several former Indiana voters who came out on the left side of the ledger and voted for Bernie Sanders; she describes herself as a social democrat. "We need a socialist," she says. Pradia, a retired teacher and nurse, says she does not support the single payer Medicare system favoured by much of the Democratic presidential field.As she prepares to travel halfway across the country to make her second trip to the polls, Pradia is considering a third way: voting for the most radical candidate who remains unknown in her home state's presidential election, a decision she says she still regrets. Her first regret is her decision to vote for Sanders, the leftist Vermont senator who became the first independent from the Democratic Party to endorse Clinton. Her second regret is, she says, being so far to the left that she can no longer vote for her own party. That is, she says, because "we are too far to the right".In Indiana, where Pradia is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, "Sanders is probably a socialist, but it's not a Republican," she says. "Democrats are not going to elect a socialist." She describes herself as a social democrat, "a democratic socialist".Her decision to cast her vote for Sanders stems from a lack of awareness of the political differences in her part of the world, where Sanders has little support among black people. "The way it is in America, they don't understand us, and then they try to convince us they understand us," Pradia says.The Democrat on the left has found her home in this state, which has been a political stronghold for black voters for so long that many, even those who supported Sanders in the primaries, have difficulty understanding the position of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, a white woman. This is particularly true in Indiana, where Sanders won only three out of four polling places in the last election, and in which the Democratic Party is still reeling from the defeat of Barack Obama.Indiana is also a battleground for the next election, in which Clinton has been dogged by a sexual abuse allegation and a controversy over	0
Boston was strong. Too strong for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Red Sox, defeated the Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday to win their eighth World Series title and cap a wicked good  season.Boston finished with a record 101-56, which also represents the most victories ever by an American League team in a World Series. The Red Sox scored 521 runs, which was second-most in the A.L. behind the Philadelphia Phillies at 548. The Red Sox averaged 5.7 runs per game, which was also tops.The Red Sox beat the Cardinals in five games, marking a rare two-game sweep. The first game, the Red Sox beat the Cardinals 11-1 on Oct. 21. The second game, a 1-0 win by the Red Sox on Oct. 25, was the second-longest game in World Series history.The Red Sox have become the first team ever to win six World Series titles since the Los Angeles Dodgers (1986-2000) had seven (in 1989-95). And just one year later, the Red Sox had five World Series titles again, this time over the St. Louis Cardinals (1997-1999).The Red Sox won their sixth title with this win because they were so, so good. The Cardinals were a middle-of-the-pack A.L. team in the final months. While the Red Sox beat the Cardinals, their record was 89-65.The Red Sox didn’t just win the World Series. They won a staggering amount throughout the entire season. Even in October, the Red Sox started the season 2-9. But they won 19 of their last 26 games to take control of the American League East. They won the division despite the fact that they had only 10 wins in their final 23 games.Boston’s World Series win wasn’t the only thing that made them great. They became the first team in history to beat the A.L. champs twice in the World Series. They became the only team to ever win the World Series with a total of 20-1.The Red Sox also used pitching to become perhaps the greatest team ever. They had five pitchers who topped 3.10 ERA, which is more than twice as many as any other team in baseball history and more than any other team in major league history.The Red Sox used three of those five pitchers	0
Federal officials said Thursday more needs to be done to warn rescuers of special dangers at the scene of small plane crashes. Although firefighters are well versed about the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris, they may not be aware that some ills they face are also common in crashes and cause injuries so severe they can make the difference between survival and death.While officials are aware of the dangers, some say rescue efforts at such scenes should be more aggressive."I would like to see it be a higher priority that we have emergency workers that, if we don't get there in time, they are there to save lives," said William "Smitty" Smith, state fire marshal.The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch Tuesday afternoon when National Guardsman and University of Maine student Jacob Stensland made a "dangerous turn" while piloting a light plane, which ultimately forced him to land in the Kennebec River.State officials said Stensland, a member of the Guard, did not follow proper procedure when taking off just after the warning time of 11:45 p.m. Officials said he did not wait for a mandatory 15-minute radio silence, instead flying off with other military members.The weather service issued a tornado watch for much of eastern Maine on Wednesday morning. But it later lifted its warning after officials said some of the storms would be too small to pose a threat to the area.The National Weather Service says as of 10 a.m. Wednesday, the worst conditions would be around the Bangor area, where tornado watches were issued Thursday morning for the areas of Waldo and Belfast.Smith said there is a better way to handle potential rescue situations at an accident scene."One thing that works and what we're doing is we're putting a second person in the airplane with an oxygen mask on. They can be in communication, can see things from the inside, and they are a rescue worker," he said.The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for much of eastern Maine on Wednesday morning.

There are two good ways to buy your new car or truck at a reasonable low price and avoid all of the negotiating games and hassles: 1. Buy through the Internet Buying your new or used car or truck through the Internet is Âs top choice: You never have to leave the comfort of your own home to negotiate prices. CarShopper.com, AutoTrader.com and e-zBuy.com are the three most valuable ways to find the cheapest prices and terms.2. Rent or lease from a local car dealership You can choose to rent or lease a new or used vehicle from a local dealership. If you decide to rent or lease through a dealer, be sure to choose the location where the dealership has a good reputation and a good return on your trade-in vehicle. Car dealerships charge lease-only financing rates, which are often higher than financing rates available on the open market. You should always remember that leasing is only for vehicles for which you do not possess a vehicle title. If you use a dealer lease plan, remember to take into account the monthly payments and the length of the contract before you commit to the lease. The term of the contract is directly related to the length of the lease, and the monthly payments are usually higher than what you would expect to pay on a regular personal loan.I would highly recommend that you visit several dealerships in your area before you decide to make a purchase decision. I have driven several cars since I started working with AutoShopper.com as an independent automotive consultant, and I have never seen a dealer that has not only one or more of the following: excellent service, a well-trained sales staff, a competitive price and a variety of available models.I know that not every dealership offers every model and that all dealerships are in different locations from each other. However, by visiting a few dealerships in your area, I can tell you the ones that are most likely to help you as they have been there for many years, have relationships with many manufacturers and will have a competitive price.I encourage all of my readers to visit the dealerships in the areas where you live and live in business to find the best deals on the vehicle of your choice at the lowest possible prices possible!I also encourage you to learn more about the vehicles you might be interested in and to take advantage of the low price guarantees for any of the	0
Thailand could soon recognize a third gender category for the first time in the country's constitution. "It is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender," vernacular trans activist Preecha Kittikachorn said.By most counts, Thailand has the world's lowest rate of transgender people. There are an estimated 900,000 transgender people worldwide, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association.The government isn't too worried about the public's reaction.The law says trans people have the right to choose their gender and to live, work and travel in whatever gender they choose — although it specifically mentions only two options: male or female."This is not a constitutional amendment. We will have to wait until the next government comes, after the one that is in the new parliament and the new constitution is drafted," said Somsak Jitpawan, the head of gender equality and youth development in the Ministry of Gender Equality & Youth.The government isn't afraid of being criticized, Somsak added.Thailand's government is preparing for the upcoming General Election. The two main parties are both expected to maintain their support."The government is planning to use all of the legal means to achieve this objective of protecting and developing the rights of transgender people," Somsak told VICE News.That includes pushing for the inclusion of gender identity in the new Constitution, which is set to take effect in 2020, according to the constitution draft."If there are no legal protection and protection, then the rights of transgender people will not be protected," said Preecha.According to a Human Rights Watch report, "the Thai government has adopted a discriminatory "bathroom policy" for transgender people." The policy prohibits them from using public bathrooms that do not match their gender identity, leaving them to use the restroom of the sex they were assigned at birth."My bathroom is a woman. It's not a problem. I don't care about that. I just want to wash my hands, use the toilet and leave," Preecha said.	0
Seattle is bigger, but Portland's scrappy supporters pushed the Oregon city to a win in the latest CNN.com city smackdown. The voting in our unscientific poll was neck and neck. Portland edged out Seattle with 52% of the vote, but despite that narrow margin, Portland fans came out with much greater force and enthusiasm to defend the City of Roses. iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland. "Well let's face it, Seattle is perhaps in the most beautiful location in the continental United States. But does physical beauty make it a better city?" Absolutely not, Wood claims in his defense of Portland, and goes on to list why "Portland thumps Seattle." Among his reasons: Portland has more park space, much better mass transit, a stronger bicycling culture and proximity to superior skiing, a renowned Pinot Noir wine region and great areas for water sports. Plus, the weather's better. Seattle's beauty is not so easily dismissed by iReporter Jane Crummett. "I lived on Bainbridge Island, Washington, 'backyard of the Emerald City,' for many years. The ferry system never got boring, and every time I rode the ferry I was dazzled by the beauty of the Puget Sound," says Crummett, who lived in the Seattle area for 12 years before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina. Seattle resident Jessa Moon is a bit conflicted. "While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city," writes Moon, who grew up in Portland. PORTLAND Moon names Last Thursday, a street fair held on the last Thursday of each month, as an example of what she loves about Portland. Hippies and yuppies rub shoulders during the event held on Alberta Street in Northeast Portland, and "hipsters showcase their latest patched vintage tweed jacket and creative take on facial hair to crowds that take in food truck fare, art, hand-sewn sock puppets, glass blown jars and any other obscure item your heart might ever have desired," Moon writes. The Portland Saturday Market, an outdoor artists market open every Saturday and Sunday, also receives a thumbs up from several CNN.com readers. Local Vern Baker and his wife are brunch aficionados. "Brunch is one of our favorite food groups," he says.	1
Two days after a Philadelphia woman's abduction was captured on video, police say they have a lead across the state line: Someone used her bank card Tuesday morning in Maryland. A male used Carlesha xtremez's Bank of America account on Jan. 14. The bank's customer service rep says she's now in custody. Police have not said what led them to that account, which was on the same card as a Maryland bank, but that's why they're saying the woman is in custody.Carlesha xtremez is being held in a Baltimore police cell at the Westview Detention Facility while an investigation continues into the incident.A police search of the woman's vehicle turned up a number of items including a computer, a phone, two cellphones and an iPod.The couple's two dogs were given shots Tuesday, police said.The woman, who police said is in her late 20s, was found in the 1300 block of North Main shortly after the kidnapping took place.At that point, police began receiving tips and looking into the possibility that her husband had returned to take her, according to the Tribune.It was then, police said, that they received a phone call from her family, saying they wanted to speak with her. They called it in to police.From jail, xtremez told reporters she had no idea what her husband was doing."I am a new married woman and I am scared and I didn't know what he wanted," she said. "I don't what he wanted to do. This was a terrifying experience."She said that the kidnapping, which occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 14, started off as something fun. They went to dinner last Sunday, where she said they drank at least five bottles of wine."I never had a problem. I never did drugs," she said. "He said he needed money, so I gave him the money to pay off bills and rent and the bills he said. And then he said he needed money for the new house. I gave him the money."About 10 minutes after they got a call from her family, xtremez said, it became more serious. Afterward, she said, her father said they had to go home because her husband had taken her.She said she got on the phone with her husband, who was	0

Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I scream, you scream, we all scream for CNN Student News! Reporting from the CNN Center in Atlanta, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care AZUZ: 14 for, 9 against. That's how the votes stacked up yesterday when the Senate Finance Committee voted on a health care proposal, and that was enough for the proposal to pass. Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat who helped write the bill -- called the Baucus Bill -- he called it a balanced plan. But the committee's top Republican says he's concerned about the direction that the bill might take health care in America. Now one thing we want to point out, this vote is just part of the process. Jessica Yellin looks at how we reached this point and where the debate is going from here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There have been at least 60 hearings, more than $124 million of TV ads, one presidential address, and an unknowable number of status updates. Finally, it's game day. Off the blocks, Chairman Baucus was feeling strong. YELLIN: It's going to pass today? SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Yep, yep, yep. Big day. YELLIN: But all eyes were on Senator Olympia Snowe, the one Republican who might vote yes. Would she? SEN. OLYMPIA SNOWE, (R) MAINE: Let's say I'm sorting through all the issues. YELLIN: All this attention, all this interest. BAUCUS: The meeting will come to order. YELLIN: This must be the final decision on health care reform, right? Wrong.	1
You think March Madness is all about basketball? Think again. Sure, millions will be watching the 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament to see whether Kentucky's bid for an unbeaten season can be quashed or whether a 14 seed can make it to the Final Four. But the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications, vasectomies and HDTV upgrades. What are the odds? (Probably a heck of a lot better than picking a perfect bracket.) Here are some of the more unusual aspects of the Big Dance: Glass slipper, golden payoff Cinderella teams don't just provide a couple weeks' entertainment; according to some studies, their success has long-term effects. Thanks to exposure from the NCAAs, such teams as Florida Gulf Coast and George Mason see rises in applications and endowments. Academics call it the "Flutie Effect" after the charge Boston College received from a last-second 1984 win against Miami, thanks to a Hail Mary pass from quarterback Doug Flutie. (Go ahead and watch it again, we'll wait.) Experts debate how much of an influence athletic wins have on admissions, but there's no question a Cinderella turn gives schools greater exposure, which certainly can't hurt. George Mason, which went to the Final Four in 2006, and Gonzaga, which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late '90s, saw applications go up after their turn on stage. Money in the basket March Madness pulls in more national TV revenue (as of 2013) than any other postseason sports franchise: $1.15 billion. A lot of that money comes from fast-food franchises, which know you like to eat while watching the games. And those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins. According to WalletHub, there's a 19% increase in pizza orders and a 9% rise in dessert orders by fans after their teams lose. Investors certainly know it: Buffalo Wild Wings stock has traditionally gone up in March. Making the cut Doctors report up to a 50% rise in the number of vasectomies during the NCAA tournament. Well, if you have to spend a few days resting on the couch ... Everybody into the pool According to a survey by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 50 million Americans participate in March Madness pools. Productivity, shmoductivity, part 1	1
My friend Brian Hull and I were both born 40 years ago today. Our lives overlapped for six years, from those first terrifying weeks of seventh grade through high school graduation. Then, like many of the friends  I've known, we drifted apart from one another.Brian was a tall and somewhat gangly kid. He was quiet and reserved, a loner who kept to himself. He was a librarian by trade, then became a high school English teacher. I was a student. He was quiet during the day. I was talkative at school and at home. But then came the day when Brian left the house. I was upset, angry, and in a state of confusion. Where had he gone? In his absence, I became quiet and withdrawn as well. I spent the majority of my time playing video games on my computer. There were none of those rare but endearing moments of closeness. I learned to keep my mouth shut. Or do my best to ignore that. I still miss him today.The two of us, we'll never really understand each other. But we do share this common bond - the belief that we were destined to spend a significant part of our lives in each other's presence.I met Brian in third grade, at a school fair in a town we never knew existed until then. He was the vice-president of the student council. During lunch, we chatted about life and how great it'd be if everyone were nice to each other. One of my favorite memories of the trip was when Brian approached me with a group of other students, told them "hi" and asked if he could join their class for lunch. I was happy that he was doing something nice for me, but more excited to be included.A few days later, he walked up to me, grabbed me and kissed me. It was the most exhilarating moment I'd have ever experienced.I was nervous about his intentions, but thrilled at his boldness.I remember his face. He was tall and handsome, with a big smile and a dimple in the middle of his chin. When he smiled, it was a big, lovable smile. When he kissed me I could feel my heart pound against his lips.After that, we talked for hours, every day after school. It was fun to talk with him about all kinds of topics such as our love of dogs,	0
Both people who died of swine flu in the United States had pre-existing health problems, federal health authorities said Thursday in a report. A student uses disinfectant as she arrives Thursday at the National Technical Institute in Mexico City. The 22-month-old child who died April 27 of the flu, also called H1N1, had neonatal myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease, said the report, which was written by a virus investigation team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The child -- who was from Mexico and who fell ill while visiting relatives in Texas -- also had a heart defect, problems swallowing and chronic hypoxia, the report said. The 33-year-old Texas woman who died last week was pregnant when she became ill, the article said. She had been diagnosed with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The details came in a summary of the 642 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection that were diagnosed between April 15 and May 5 in 41 states among patients ranging in age from 3 months to 81 years. Sixty percent were 18 years or younger and 18 percent had recently traveled to Mexico, the report said. It said that 36 of the 399 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection whose hospitalization status was known had been hospitalized. Of the 22 hospitalized patients for whom data were available, four were younger than 5. Nine had chronic medical conditions, some of which included Down Syndrome and congenital heart disease. Seven patients said they had traveled to Mexico during the week before onset of illness. Eleven of those 22 hospitalized patients had pneumonia and eight patients were treated in an intensive care unit. Four were placed on ventilators. As of Tuesday, 18 of the 22 patients who had been hospitalized had recovered, it said. In a conference call with reporters, CDC's Dr. Carolyn Bridges said epidemiologists would be scrutinizing the disease's spread in South America, where the cool season is set to begin. Flu virus "prefers lower humidity and lower temperatures for transmission," she said. "We'll be looking closely to the Southern Hemisphere during their winter to see what happens. That may give us some clues as to what to expect." Brazil's health minister told reporters Thursday that four cases of H1N1 infection have been confirmed in Brazil.	1
Canada's Supreme Court has struck down the country's laws about prostitution. While selling sex for money isn't illegal in Canada, until Friday's 9-0 ruling, three specific laws had made it difficult for Â­pregnant women or people under the age of 16 to buy sex.The three laws are the age of consent in the country, the fact that buying sex is illegal in many communities that accept prostitution and the fact that many people who sell sex won't go through background checks.These laws were on the books in the province of Quebec, for example, for years.Quebec's top court decision in this case, which will now become law, has been met with shock and horror in Canada."The court is striking down a law," says Pauline Larivee of Amnesty International Canada."It's the right decision to make and it's the right decision to make in Canada," says former federal immigration minister Peter McKay.We can't speak for the Supreme Court, but we know that it's not just sex work that's outlawed in Canada, but also any activity that involves the use of drugs or alcohol - including people who sell alcohol or drugs."It's a very bad decision and it is also a terrible precedent," says Michael Kowalski of the Canadian HIV and AIDS Legal Network."They'll be able to get around it now," says Anne Mowat of the advocacy group, Amnesty International."They won't be able to get around it again. That's a very important message."We went through the three parts of this big ruling. Here's what happened in Part 0:How the laws were writtenA law called the Criminal Code and the Traffic Act is often referred to as legislation that criminalizes prostitution.That's not quite right. The Criminal Code prohibits prostitution offences. The Traffic Act is a law that makes it illegal for anyone in Canada to drive from Toronto to Quebec City.And it's not like the law says you can have sex with someone over five years old, or something in that nature. This is a very specific law in the Criminal Code that says you can't have sex with someone under 13, and you can't have sex with someone aged 14 and below.But, of course, many provinces have their own laws that make the same thing illegal. And the	0

North and South Korean officials started talks Saturday on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex, a suspended joint factory that marked a symbol of cooperation between the two rivals. Each side sent a delegation of three members to Tongilgak, the ersatz capital of the complex, the Korean Central News Agency reported. The United States and South Korea began discussing ways to restart production after a meeting of their defense chiefs in Seoul.The United States, hoping for quick progress, sought to use the talks to boost bilateral ties. The two Koreas have enjoyed broad confidence and stability in nearly 30 years of hostility, and Washington is eager to return to that with Seoul and Pyongyang in talks aimed at ending the war that started with a North Korean nuclear test in 2006. South Korean officials have suggested that North Korea would open up the complex for business once the inter-Korean stalemate ends.However, North Korean officials have suggested that the complex's closure was not a result of the war but of South Korea’s failure to pay its bills.Although the two Koreas continue to have strained relations, they have managed to maintain a strong military relationship despite the war that halted regular joint military exercises.The two sides are also working to reduce tensions, which have spiked since April 8, the date North Korea claimed that leader Kim Jong-Un had visited the South in what appeared to be a failed assassination attempt. The North Korean leader said he traveled to the demilitarized zone, the location of the 2000-square-mile no man's land, but the South Korea Defense Ministry said in its latest report on the visit that Mr. Kim stopped on the edge of the truce village, about 20 miles from the DMZ.South Korea's Defense Ministry said Monday that it was confident the military would secure the DMZ and guarantee the safety of all soldiers in the border area from North Korean provocations.About UsWelcome to the International Baccalaureate Program at Cane Hill School!

He racked up two within the space of a month in 2008, but six years on Padraig Harrington will once again find himself watching a major from afar. The two-time British Open winner's frustrating 2014 continued Monday after he failed to qualify for the U.S. Open for the first time in 15 years. Harrington was unable to advance from the 36-hole qualifying event at Walton Heath's New Course, falling six strokes short after recording rounds of 75 and 71. The disappointment follows on from the 42-year-old's failure to qualify for the Masters for the first time in 14 years last month, with his five-year qualifying exemption from his 2008 U.S. PGA Championship win having expired. "The damage was done in the morning with that 75," Harrington told the PGA Tour's official website. Harrington felt his unfamiliarity with the New Course played a part in his downfall. "[I] just made a few mistakes in not knowing the golf course and I was never comfortable with the pace of the greens, as there was a number of three-putts thrown in there," he added. Harrington's recent setbacks are all the more remarkable given that in 2008 he secured his second British Open title, before adding a maiden U.S.PGA Championship just a month later. The Irishman's form has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years and he is still searching for a first win on the European Tour or PGA Tour since claiming the U.S. PGA Championship. Harrington, who revealed that he had undergone skin cancer treatment in February, has slipped to 214th in the world rankings. The six-time Ryder Cup player is now set to take a week's break before returning to the PGA Tour for the FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis, which takes place from June 5-8. Harrington's compatriot Shane Lowry, meanwhile, built on his second-placed finish at the European PGA Championship Sunday to finish top at Walton Heath. Lowry, who missed out to Rory McIlroy by a shot at Wentworth, carded rounds of 69 and 67 to secure his spot at the U.S. Open. It is the second time in five attempts that the 26-year-old has been successful at Walton Heath in qualifying for the tournament.	1
Modern technology has made campaigning much easier in some ways. It's now possible to raise millions in small donations through the Internet, host Facebook town halls and galvanize millions of supporters through Twitter. An ad can be released on YouTube and attract enough media coverage to make it worthwhile without spending a dime on TV time. Technology is also a double-edged sword that's made campaigning more complicated. A candidate's every word can now be captured by modern technology and live in e-perpetuity. There is no such thing as wiping the slate clean after the primary. Candidates should be read their Miranda Rights before beginning a campaign. Anything they say can and will be used against them. How can Mitt Romney contend with some of the things he said during the primary campaign which will come back to haunt him in the general election? He needs to gracefully pivot. Nowhere is this more true than in his outreach efforts with Hispanics. Romney cannot Hispander (blatant pandering to Hispanics, usually involving mariachi music and merciless butchering of the Spanish language). He cannot flip-flop on immigration (again). He's fought the flip-flopper label for years, and neither the right that still doesn't entirely trust him nor the left that is salivating to defeat him will let him get away with a drastic change of position. Romney desperately needs to improve his numbers with Latinos. Polls show Romney trailing by as much as an unbelievable 50 percentage points behind President Obama with Hispanic voters. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain won 31% of the Latino vote. It cost him states like Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah. Unless Romney gets close to 40% of the Latino vote, he can kiss the White House goodbye. Polls also show that immigration is not the most important issue for Latinos. Like other Americans, we are most concerned about the economy. Still, immigration does set a tone. If Latinos perceive a candidate as anti-immigrant, it can turn them off, period. So, what's Romney to do? He can't erase the things he's said on immigration. Despite his campaign's efforts, they can't make supporters (or an adviser) like Kris Kobach disappear, and he is as radioactive as Kryptonite in the Latino community.	1
As the global population hits 7 billion in the coming days, nations can take steps to tackle critical challenges and prepare for the arrival of billions more people this century, the United Nations said Wednesday. The milestone is expected to Ã¢ÂÂbring humanity closer to the worldÃ¢ÂÂs greatest challenge of all: to feed a planet of 9.7 billion people within the next 30 years while reducing poverty-related environmental damage and global warming, while protecting the planet for future generations.Ã¢ÂÂThis could be a moment to look back at what we have accomplished as a nation, said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who will also present the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the U.N. General Assembly Feb. 23. According to Ban, the new United NationsÃ¢ÂÂ goals will not only make sure that everyone gets enough to eat, but will also ensure that everyone has clean water, proper health care and a decent education.The United Nations hopes to see a major paradigm shift toward economic growth that helps every child get an opportunity, said Ban. As global population reaches 8 billion, Ban said that we must continue to support a peaceful and secure environment to ensure that the planet can sustain a growing population.UN Population Fund Executive Director Josephine Strunska said that while the new goals are ambitious, they will provide the U.N. with a clear roadmap to ensure that women and men throughout the world are able to produce life, dignity and prosperity for their children.A lot of people have the misconception that we should be focused on population control, but population control is far from our main objective as people and we need to focus on quality of life, said U.N. Population Division Deputy Director Dr. Mary Robinson, adding that governments must work toward creating sustainable development goals that have the highest population.In addition to the new goals, the United Nations is announcing the first set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health and education. These goals were created to guide the United Nations and its member countries in their efforts to achieve what Ban referred to as the ``minimum acceptable standard of health and education for all people on the planet.``According to Ban, the new MDGs will include an emphasis on early and comprehensive health care services, access to safe water, equitable access to basic education	0
Eleven years ago this week, the world faced the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, a new epidemic that infected some 8,000 people, took the lives of 775 individuals, and inflicted $30 billion in damage to regional  health systems and economies. Although officials were initially baffled by the virus's spread, it's likely the origin of the spread of other viruses.The origins of the virus can be traced to contact with a single civet cat at a live-animal market in Guangdong province, China, which had been brought in from Hanoi by a visiting American missionary. In addition, the virus originated with another animal, a bat, in Guangdong. For three years, until the SARS outbreak began, several other viruses evolved in bats in Guangdong.A virus and the environment to which it gives rise can be thought of as an "artifact": a discrete item that has come about as the result of a complex series of interactions, driven by chemical and mechanical forces. A piece of a broken vase can be thought of as an artifact that, over time, has come about by a myriad of distinct interactions. Likewise, a virus may, over time, develop in a host animal's body.Viruses can exist as genetic material stored in host cells, and as proteins in the host animal's body. Viruses also have a genetic material that can replicate in cells; in human beings, some viruses, including HIV and hepatitis C, make their genetic material, called RNA, as a single piece in the host cell.All living things reproduce both RNA and DNA. This genetic material can be extracted from the host's own cells or from other sources. While viral RNA is synthesized and stored in the host's cells, DNA is replicated in its own cells. A virus's genetic material can then be extracted (extrinsically) from infected animals, cells, or tissue.It is these extrinsic sources of genetic material that give rise to the viruses, and that ultimately determine whether viruses will continue to emerge and spread. In the case of the SARS virus, the genetic material was extracted from animals and the environment to which it has given rise.The Viruses and the Environmental EnvironmentsThe environmental environments in which viruses have evolved have played a central role in determining the prevalence and spread of viral infections.

The legacy of U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died on Tuesday, spreads far and wide, and across the ocean to now-independent Bangladesh. There, he is still revered for calling attention to what many deemed an unfolding genocide. The genocide known as Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence, which resulted in Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971, is believed to have killed tens of thousands of civilians, or the “missing.”Kennedy led the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims for nearly 30 years before his death in London. He began by calling for investigations into Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He worked to pass the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in 2007. He also called attention to the United States' treatment of immigrants during his time in the Senate. He was a longtime advocate for justice in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He helped pass the Iran Freedom and Counter-Terrorism Act and was a lead author of the Iraq Liberation Act. Throughout his entire career, he was a fighter for justice and liberty. Kennedy was appointed to the Senate in 1962. He was elected to four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives before making his way to the U.S. Senate. During his career, he held many influential positions. He won five terms as a Democratic senator and was an outspoken critic of American foreign policy, which he saw as being based on "a moral and spiritual bankruptcy." His political philosophy was a mixture of liberal values and strong anti-war sentiments. He was a founding member of the Civil Rights and Immigration Committee of the Senate. Kennedy was a vocal critic of America's involvement in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken supporter of human rights and civil liberties. He was a critic of American foreign policy following the September 11 attacks, and called for international cooperation. His support for human rights and civil liberties helped him be a leading critic of U.S. policy. In fact, he became the first U.S. senator to call for the release of human rights monitors by the United Nations. His strong anti-war sentiments led him to support the Iraq War, in spite of being repeatedly voted down by his colleagues in the Senate. He was also a critic of the War in Iraq at a time when many of his fellow Democrats in the Senate were in support of the Iraq War. It was during his first term as a U.	0
Tiger Woods is no longer officially considered one of golf's top 50 players, ending a streak that extended back 15 years. According to the official World Golf Ranking, the 35-year-old Woods entered the weekend as the sport's 50th best player. But he lost that standing when Louis Oosthuizen finished tied for fifth at this weekend's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland, earning him a place in the standings and ousting Woods. The rankings are endorsed by Professional Golf Association tours in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, according to the World Golf Ranking website. An updated ranking comes out every Monday. The last time Woods was not among the top 50 was on October 13, 1996. Since then, he won 14 major championships -- a distinction used for the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA championship -- and, for much of the next 778 weeks, ranked as the game's best player. In recent years, Woods has been plagued by the fallout surrounding his infidelity and divorce from his wife as well as numerous injuries. His last tournament win was the Australian Masters in November 2009. His next competition will be this week at the Frys.com Open in Corde Valley, California. Despite his recent slump, American team captain Fred Couples chose Woods as one of his wild card picks for next month's Presidents Cup in Australia. CNN's Jason Durand contributed to this report.	1
Sudan ordered a number of international aid agencies to leave the country Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued for the country's president, a United Nations source in the capital city of Khartoum said. Sudan's President Omar ursal Omar al-Bashir appeared in court and was ordered to remain in custody pending an investigation into alleged embezzlement of funds earmarked for famine victims, the official told CNN.An Egyptian official told the Daily Telegraph that the country's former leader, Hosni Mubarak, was being taken to a hospital in Cairo after suffering serious injuries, which officials suspect were inflicted by protesters. Hosni Mubarak, the 82-year-old former armed forces chief who ruled Egypt from Cairo for nearly three decades, was injured in clashes during the day as supporters of deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi rallied outside the prosecutor's office.The US and Britain on Thursday called on Sudan to free President Omar al-Bashir, a day after prosecutors in Khartoum issued arrest warrants for him and nine other individuals on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, a prosecutor said. Bashir, who has been in office since 1989, has denied the charges, which relate to the sale of oil on behalf of Sudan as well as his alleged involvement in a number of other graft scandals.British Airways said it is investigating reports that three of its employees have been detained at its Brussels airport by anti-riot police after a flight to Toronto was cancelled. British Airways said in a statement that the three were arrested at about 8:45am local time (0645GMT). The airline said that "the aircraft, flight, and crew are safely in Dublin for a full investigation." It added that it is working with the authorities to ascertain what happened.Egypt's embattled President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Wednesday lashed out at the United States for not lifting its ban on military aid to Egypt, but said he does not regret allowing the arms to be used on the streets. In response to the US decision to keep the military aid on hold for the next three months, el-Sisi said, "It is an act of treason" and that the decision will harm Egypt, while "it is a great and historic mistake".Former US President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged a swift end to the fighting between government forces and Islamic militants in Somalia, where a string of bombings have killed nearly 300 people so far	0
Lake Urmia in Iran used to be a site to reckon with. Twenty years ago, it ranked as the sixth largest saltwater lake in the world, and the largest in the Middle East. Tourists would revel in the lake's buoyancy (like the Dead Sea, the salt level made it impossible to sink), and the flocks of flamingos, pelicans and yellow deer that once inhabited the surrounding areas. Today, Urmia is a shadow of its former self. Decades of poor water management, aggressive agricultural policies and drought have rendered it almost completely dried up (according to the United Nations Development Program, the lake has shrunk by two-thirds since 1997). Rusted boats lay abandoned in what is now essentially a giant salt flat. The tourists are long gone, as are many of the animals that once called the lake home. "It's like seeing a scene from a different planet. I saw caterpillars and bobcats taking salt from the dead body of the lake," recalls Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Iran. "It's a testament to how rapidly we can break something." It's a problem that President Hassan Rouhani is aware of, and one he wants to fix. Last month, he agreed to spend $500 million in the first year alone of a ten-year recovery plan (the total bill is $5 billion). "If the lake dries up, this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat," he said in a public statement in January. It's not an overblown statement. According to experts, Iran is on the brink of a water crisis. "In the year 1956, the per capita water available in Iran was 7,000 cubic meters. Today, it is 1,900 cubic meters. In the year 2020, it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters," says Lewis. The estimates fall far short of the 30 million cubic meters he believes will be needed to accommodate the burgeoning population -- which could reach 90 million in the next decade. Shortages are cited throughout the country, not just at Lake Urmia, but in the Hamoun Wetlands in the east of the country -- a one-time oasis surrounded by fishing villages that has since dried up. In 2012 alone, the Hamoun water crisis sent 600,000 environmental refugees into the north of the country.	1
Manchester City crashed out of European competition following a 1-0 defeat at Borussia Dortmund. Julian Schieber scored the only goal of the game to claim victory for the Germans and kill off any hopes City had of reaching the Europa League. City has endured a dismal Champions League campaign and knew its hopes of reaching the last-16 had already faded before the trip to Dortmund. But it had hoped to at least pick up the consolation of making it through to the Europa League, especially with Ajax facing Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. English Premier League's hidden costs revealed But that dream was left shattered as the English Premier League champions were given a reality check. Boss Roberto Mancini will now look ahead to Sunday's Manchester derby after his team became the first from England to not win a single group game in the competition. "We lost our qualification tonight," he told reporters. "We lost it before tonight, we tried (to qualify) but we're missing more players. We had the chance to score but if in these moments you don't score it's difficult to win. "We are not in the Europa League, and for this we should be disappointed." Elsewhere in Group D, Kaka scored the 28th Champions League goal of his career to become the all-time leading Brazilian goalscorer in the competition. The Real Madrid star was on target during his side's 4-1 win over Ajax with Cristiano Ronaldo and a brace from Jose Callejon completing the rout. Kaka's strike takes him past former Barcelona star Rivaldo, who had led the way with 27 goals to his name. Messi and Ronaldo battle for Ballon d'Or Ronaldo's effort was his 61st goal of 2012, one more than last year, and his seventh against Ajax in the Champions League. The win means Real qualify in second place behind Borussia Dortmund. In Group A, Paris Saint-Germain claimed a 2-1 victory and top spot against Porto with both teams already having qualified for the next stage. Thiago Silva and Ezequiel Lavezzi were on target for the home side with Jackson Martinez netting for Porto, which finishes second in the group. Dynamo Kiev was forced to play through a snow storm during its 1-1 draw at Dinamo Zagreb. Both teams were led off the field with just 11 minutes on the clock as a blizzard forced the game to be halted.	1
The arrests of 11 people accused of being part of an espionage ring under deep cover for Russia shocked their neighbors in the suburbs. Presumably it was also news to President Obama, coming as it did right after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's departure. What should not be a surprise to any of us, however, is that Russia continues to spy on the United States. Espionage is a fact of international life and always has been. The first spy manual, The Art of War, was written by Sun Tzu some 2,500 years ago. Espionage fills a vital niche; a successful operation can provide insight into intentions, plans, and human dynamics that cannot be gleaned from intercepted communications or pictures from space. It is safe to assume that since the end of World War II there has never been a day that the Soviet Union or Russia was not spying on the United States, or vice versa. Espionage will continue, even as the United States and Russia work out a new modus vivendi. Presidents Obama and Medvedev may have recently "reset" the U.S.-Russian relationship, but that does not mean U.S. and Russian interests or perspectives are necessarily aligned. There remain significant issues of disagreement over European security. The two countries have until recently been at loggerheads over Iran. After September 11, Russia reluctantly allowed the United States military to operate out of bases in Central Asia, which it views as its own backyard. The two countries belong to the G-8 and the G-20 -- venues not only for cooperation, but also for sparring. Russia also has great incentive to continue its historical efforts to ferret out America's economic secrets and steal its weapons technology. Frankly, in a world in which even allies spy on one another, the Russian intelligence service would be shockingly incompetent if it were not spying on us. Espionage operations tend to operate on long timelines, and the alleged Russian implanting of "illegals" in this country fits the pattern. Juan Jose Lazaro and Vicky Pelaez came to our shores more than 20 years ago; Richard and Cynthia Murphy reportedly came in the mid-1990s; Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley in 1999; Michael Zottoli in 2001.	1
It's the most wonderful time of the year." That's what Andy Williams sang 50 years ago, and for some, the song rings true. For others, left cold by carols and gift wrap, urgings to iced coffee and a hot toddy, the season is a time of year when we're all too busy to notice the light and warmth in our lives. There's nothing like a cozy fire crackling on the hearth with hot tea and a sweet potato pie on the table. While the holidays have always brought comfort, our need of them may vary from person to person. We are all different, and we all have to figure out what each holiday is about to make sense for us as individual individuals.With a little bit of research and a bit of contemplation, we can find a personal meaning that makes us happy and a happy meaning that fits us. We can also find a message that speaks to our own spirit. And if we're too busy to get the full meaning of the season, we can have a great time without feeling guilt for not getting the full meaning of the season.#  **SUMMER: A SALE SEASON**I never thought about the fact that summer was the sale season until I went away to college. I studied English and the sale in English was called the Oxford American College Sale. (You don't find that word anywhere else in the English dictionary.) So, I went to the sales and studied the catalogues. Every year, they'd have something new and something I really liked. Sometimes the best things in my college catalogues were the things that I had to go get.A catalog of sales in a college is not a comprehensive list of all the items available: there are no categories, no price limits, and no need to buy everything. Just buy what you like and don't get overwhelmed by the selection. I know I do it myself from time to time. Some years, I buy the books I really like and don't buy the rest of the books at all. That way, when I look back, I think, "See, I did learn something from the sale." I like to read more than I used to in my younger years, but I don't buy that many books.When I was in college, there were three main kinds of sales in my country, but we were fortunate to have the greatest sales that one could possibly have.	0
Pakistan detained a senior Army officer for suspected connections to a militant organization, a military spokesman said Tuesday. Brig. Ali Khan, stationed at military headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi for the past two years, has been in custody for the past two days over alleged links to the militant group Hizb ut-Tahrir, said spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. He said the Pakistani army follows a "zero tolerance policy" for anyone "indulging in such illegal and unauthorized activities." An investigation into Khan is ongoing. Khan's detainment comes as Pakistan's ties to the United States have been strained over strategy in combating terrorism. Lask week, Pakistan's intelligence agency detained several people who gave information to the United States before the raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. Washington has complained that Pakistan has not done enough to fight al Qaeda and other militants. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. Hizb ut-Tahrir has been critical of Pakistan's American allies and has called for an end to the U.S. military presence in the South Asian nation. CNN's Aliza Kassim and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.	1
To wander the Farnborough airfield during trade show week is to be dwarfed by the big beasts of global aviation, from the epic Dreamliners to the needle-sharp fighter jets, and all for sale. But with even the cheapest models costing many millions of dollars, is there any prospect that owning an aircraft could follow computers and cars in becoming affordable to the masses? The figures indicate otherwise. Private jet sales slowed to a crawl following the global recession, falling 3.4% to 682 in 2012 in the U.S. and rising just 0.9% the following year. Even this minor growth has been concentrated at the top end of the market, with sales contracting toward the lower end. Bombardier airline President Eric Martel was candid about the prospect of an upturn, saying Monday: "It's no secret the light segment has been difficult over the last couple of years." An enthusiast could still fulfill their dream through a fixed kit plane, or a discontinued antique. But looking ahead, their best bet might be the emerging field of the car-plane hybrid. This week at the Farnborough International Airshow, Parajet is showcasing the SkyRunner to potential aviation distributors with a price tag of $80,000. The design combines an all-terrain vehicle with a light sport aircraft capable of soaring 15,000 feet at a speed of 55mph, with a flying time of three hours. Powered by an innovative low-carbon petrol engine, the hybrid is presented as "the next generation of recreational aircraft...designed primarily to make aviation easily accessible and fun." The vehicle has undergone testing over five years, including a voyage from London to Timbuktu flown by inventor Gilo Cardozo. It builds on the motor design of the company's signature product, a propeller-powered jetpack already established on the market. Parajet manager Tom Prideaux-Brune believes the new concept is ready and is now being fine tuned for specific markets. "We have built it and proved it works so now we can take it forward to manufacturing. We can launch when we have the distributors." Classified as a light aircraft, SkyRunner must overcome regulatory hurdles. "It's about planning and registering it, so that the authorities know who is operating it and has had sufficient training. The Civil Aviation Authority has been very positive."	1
It started out as a lovely summer night in northern California: an outdoor concert at a winery that's set among redwoods and that bills itself as "miles away but worlds apart." But Thursday's show by the band The Swell Season at the Mountain Winery, just outside San Jose, turned tragic when a concertgoer leapt from the roof of the stage, landed near the lead singer and died, in what authorities say was a suicide. "Upon arriving, deputies found a doctor and an EMT on the scene, performing CPR on the victim," said Rick Sung, public information officer for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. "They did that for almost half an hour when the doctor pronounced the victim dead." The suicide victim, Michael Edward Pickels, 32, had attended the concert with a friend, Sung said. "During the performance, the victim left his personal items behind with his friend," Sung said. "The next thing (witnesses) see is the victim appears on the rooftop out of nowhere and throws himself off." The roof was about 35 to 40 feet above the stage, Sung said. The doctor who pronounced Pickels dead had been attending the concert. Authorities said Saturday that Pickels had been out of jail on $150,000 bail after threatening to kill his girlfriend and himself on New Year's Day. Pickels had been charged with assault with a firearm, domestic violence and false imprisonment, Sung said. Pickels had bound his girlfriend, aimed a loaded gun at her, and said he was going to kill them both, according to Sung. The girlfriend talked him out of it, Sung said, then fled and phoned the sheriff's office. When deputies arrived at Pickels' house, he refused to come out for 90 minutes before surrendering. Pickels' death was ruled a suicide by Santa Clara County's coroner Friday, Sung said. The Mountain Winery relies on Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies to patrol its parking lot and concessions area during concerts, Sung said, but provides its own security for the stage and audience area. The winery, located in Saratoga, did not immediately return a call for comment Saturday night, though it addressed the incident in a brief message on its web site.	1
December 6, 2010 Download PDF maps related to today's show: • Afghanistan • South Korea • Albania • Israel Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Welcome to CNN Student News with Carl Azuz! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Now that is how you get a show poppin'! Thank you gentlemen very much. Welcome, all of you, to a new week of CNN Student News! I'm Carl Azuz, and we thank all our viewers from all over the world for tuning in. First Up: Unemployment Report AZUZ: The first Friday of every month, the U.S. government usually announces the current unemployment rate. Bad news: This past Friday's announcement came as a surprise; the rate went up to 9.8 percent. It had been 9.6 percent for several months. Some experts were predicting it would stay the same. More than 15 million Americans looking for work, not good news. But there are some people who are actually encouraged by the increase. The unemployment rate only counts people who are actively looking for jobs. So if the rate goes up, it could mean that Americans who'd stopped looking think they have a better chance of finding work, so they're back on the job hunt. Still, analysts say it is disappointing the overall job market hasn't gotten better. Afghanistan Visit AZUZ: President Obama is back in Washington after a trip to Afghanistan. He made a surprise visit there on Friday, meeting with thousands of U.S. troops. This is his second trip to Afghanistan since he became president. Dan Lothian has more on the president's time in Afghanistan and why it didn't go exactly as planned. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It was a secret trip the White House says was in the works for more than a month; flying into Bagram Air Base for a little more than four hours to salute the men and women who are carrying out the administration's stepped-up strategy in Afghanistan. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This part of the world is the center of a global effort where we are going to disrupt and dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and that's why you're here.	1
Spanish police have arrested 750 people after a nationwide investigation into fake businesses, according to a statement Wednesday. The mass arrests were part of a crackdown on a scam through which $28 million of public funds were paid out for Social Security benefits, according to the police statement. Police targeted fake companies operating in tourism, construction, industrial cleaning and package delivery, and made the arrests over recent months. "Among those arrested are 30 managers of the fake companies who, without any real business activity, registered people for Social Security to illicitly obtain benefits, or to obtain residency or working permits for foreign citizens," the police statement said. A total of 8,400 people were registered on Social Security rolls as part of the scam, and in 2,100 cases, they received some form of government payout. In addition, 362 foreigners were able to get working or residency papers in Spain through the fraud, the police said. The investigation uncovered 4,000 crimes of document and other fraud linked to the payments from public funds. More than half of the 750 arrests were made in Madrid and Barcelona, but there were also dozens of arrests each in the cities of Almeria, Alicante, Jaen, Granada, Valencia and Guadalajara. The operation, which the police said was the largest to date, represents about half the arrests made in the past year to crackdown on such fraud. Police say it has cost the state a total of $64 million. The police statement did not detail how they would recover the money or revoke fraudulent working papers. The Labor Ministry press office said the 8,400 people falsely added to social security rolls were recorded as part of the government's employment statistics. But they are likely to have had little impact on the real statistics, which show 5.9 million Spaniards out of work and the unemployment rate at 25.9%.	1
Microsoft unveiled Windows 8 for public testing on Wednesday in the hope that it will help the brand win back some of the ground it has been losing to Apple and Google. The new operating system works on tablets as well as PCs and Â¡Ã¸Ã¼ with touch-enabled devices. Windows 8 is a clean update to the Windows Phone 7 operating system, and the new interface is visually appealing. The user interface is designed to be easy to use and yet still attractive.Windows 8 is currently in a very early beta stage. Microsoft says that the public testing stage will last until mid-2012Â¬ though the Redmond, Wash. company also has a specific date for the final Windows 8 launch and the roll-out to every user in the world. The company has been working with partners and building in test centers around the world to ensure adequate quality of the public testing so Windows 8 can be widely used.Windows 8 is being built upon the foundation of the Windows Phone 7.5 software that is now available for the Android, SymbianÂ¬OS, and iOSÂ¬Operating SystemÂ¬.

An overwhelming vote by residents of the Falkland Islands to remain under British rule didn't quell claims from Argentina on Tuesday. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called this week's two-day referendum a "parody" and maintained that the territory, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, rightfully belongs to her country. "It is as if a consortium of occupiers had voted on whether to continue illegally occupying a building," she said at an event in Buenos Aires. "The results were fixed." Asked whether they wanted to remain a British Overseas Territory, more than 99% of voters who cast ballots said yes, according to a Falkland Islands government spokesman. Just three people voted no, spokesman Darren Christie said. Pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in Union flags as they cast their votes. Cars displayed banners that read, "We're British and proud." A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday. The vote drew praise from British Prime Minister David Cameron. "It's the clearest possible result there could be," he said, "and the fact is that the Falkland Islands may be thousands of miles away, but they are British through and through, and that is how they want to stay." Argentina should respect the will of the islanders, he said, adding that the United Kingdom "will always be there to defend them." Before the results were announced, one lawmaker from the islands criticized Argentina for arguing that the vote was illegitimate. "I believe we are like other people in the world, and we are entitled to determine our own future. ... I think it's dreadful that someone like Argentina should be trying to deny us that," Sharon Halford, a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly, told CNN. "They obviously don't care what their own people think, but worldwide, everybody has the right to determine their own future, and why should we not be the same?" Argentina's top diplomat in the United Kingdom, meanwhile, maintained her government's position that the referendum did nothing to settle the issue. "The British inhabitants of the Malvinas Islands unquestionably enjoy civil and political rights," Argentinian Ambassador Alicia Castro said in a statement Tuesday. "But they do not have the right to decide the sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom." Renewed tensions	1
It was impossible not to be deeply moved by Harun Calehr when he and his family joined Chris Cuomo live on "New Day" on Wednesday. You see, up until that moment we had been detached. We may have seen the bodies of the dead scattered across the Eastern Ukrainian countryside, distorted, rotting, a dog running from the crash site with something in its mouth. Seen the scattered belongings, many strangely intact, the house keys, the Bali travel guide, the child's toy perched on top of the wreckage, retrieved by a villager from where it had fallen from the sky. We may have dashed along potted roads, finding new routes to avoid the shelling, pleading with the sun not to fall so we could be safer. Through check point after check point, guns aimed at us. Convoys of tanks and artillery on those same roads, belonging to both sides and wondered their destination, purpose and origin. We may have sat across from the self-appointed Prime Minister of his self-declared Republic and asked him if he and his men, so many of whom are from Russia, had shot down the plane. Eye to eye, asked him if he was backed, armed and incited by Russia. And we joined the OSCE monitors as they gathered around the train being used to transport the dead from this militia controlled so called Republic, and balked with them at the stench, the hacking, repulsive, gut wrenching smell as the refrigerated train door opened to reveal desperate, bagged and reeking cargo. MH17: What happens to the victims' bodies next? But standing in front of a family who lost two of their children, ten year old Miguel and nineteen year old Shaka Calehr. Two bright lives, crushed by mistake or design. Looking at their mother, far too emotional to even speak. That was too much. We came off air for a commercial break, but actually it was a break down. We'd covered every angle of the story in Eastern Ukraine and standing in Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, the origin of that desperate flight, surrounded by those paying their respects, laying flowers on Holland's day of national mourning. As journalists we are often fickle and fleeting in our gaze, but we remain proud and committed to impartiality. Too often impartiality breeds a lack of empathy, not wanting to be drawn too close to one side or the other.	1
Editor's note: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci: Progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but "our work is just one little piece of a giant jigsaw puzzle," Fauci said to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee just ahead of President Obama's announcement last December that U.S. government funding for AIDS research had increased by $750 million. The $750 million, for the most part, was spent in the U.S."I think you are going to see some real progress in the next five or 10 years, not just as a result of what we've done this year, but as a result of the future funding that we'll receive," Fauci told the committee."It does not mean we are all set up for success, but we're on the right course," Fauci said. "I think there is a real possibility of HIV/AIDS being beaten, but it takes money."Last year's funding was partly a result of renewed outrage at the U.S. government's failure to stem the tide of infection, and the funding increase was "a reflection of the efforts taken by the administration" during the first term, Fauci said. "The number of the new infections are down from their peak, but there are now more infections in more countries than ever before."Fauci, the director of the NIH, pointed out that it was the AIDS crisis that ushered in an era of highly skilled scientific breakthrough in the fight against AIDS."We know that prevention will be the most effective way to help this disease go away," Fauci said. "You can imagine if we had a problem like AIDS in the 1970s."But prevention has not worked and "we are still seeing more new cases than we did back then," Fauci said. "We are not done working on the research front of the issues. It will take money, effort, and time."Fauci told the committee he agreed with President Obama's commitment last December to double federal AIDS funding to $1 billion annually.Fauci also gave an upbeat outlook for scientists to continue their research."I'm looking out at a very promising research area that's working	0
If the Gaza truce holds and Israel's Operation Protective Edge comes to its conclusion, some things are certain. Both Israel and Hamas will declare military victory -- Israel pointing to the destruction of militants' tunnels and depletion of Hamas' rocket supply; Hamas pointing to dozens of dead Israeli troops and the survival of Hamas leadership in Gaza. But unlike in previous conflicts, when Hamas had the support of many Arab nations, things have changed. This time, as CNN has reported, the fighting between Israel and Hamas has been a proxy war for the Mideast. Key regional players Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have their own reasons to want to fend off the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is part, experts say. And Europe, like the United States, lists Hamas as a terrorist organization for its numerous attacks on civilians. But the group does have the support of some countries. "It's no longer the Muslims against the Jews," said Danielle Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. "Now it's the extremists -- the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, and their backers Iran, Qatar and Turkey -- against Israel and the more moderate Muslims including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia." A look at some key Hamas supporters: Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supports Hamas. "Erdogan has tried to use the cause of the Brotherhood to bolster his own Islamist credentials at home," says Eric Trager, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Turkey also has "more of an ideological sympathy with the Brotherhood," Trager says. Qatar Qatar supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt -- which was toppled from power in a coup last year. Qatar funds many Muslim Brotherhood figures in exile, including Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal, who is believed to have orchestrated numerous terrorist attacks. "Qatar has a long history of providing shelter to Islamist groups, amongst them the Muslim Brotherhood and the Taliban," Shashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute tells Time. Advocating for Hamas is beneficial to Turkey and Qatar in their political objectives because the cause draws popular support at home, says world affairs writer Frida Ghitis in a CNN.com column.	1
To insure or not to insure?" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week. Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. "For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested," said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like "The Parent Trap," is too risky to cast in a film.  Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles » It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in "Poor Things," a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.  See a gallery of Lohan's films » A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. "I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue," said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. "It's pretty standard year to year." But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be "serious at this point." She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted.	1
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday that human genes cannot be patented. But in something of a compromise, all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable, a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented. Legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing, likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable. The overriding legal question addressed was whether "products of nature" can be treated the same as "human-made" inventions, allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies. The broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting-edge medical science, the power of business and individual legal rights, and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases, like cancer. The issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities. But it was a blockbuster celebrity, actress Angelina Jolie who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test. The Supreme Court case involves Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified -- BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities. It says 1 million patients have benefited from its "BRAC Analysis" technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly. An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second called BART to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars. Jolie had Myriad's breast cancer test. Plaintiffs and testing Among those challenging the Myriad patents were sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40. The initial BRCA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carried the cancer-causing mutation all along. Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers.	1
Flooding described by India's prime minister as the worst in recent times, has left at least 95 people dead and almost 2 million others homeless in the country's remote Assam state.

Even if the Senate backs President Barack Obama's call for military action against Syria, a wall of outright opposition or skepticism from Democrats and Republicans in the House makes approval there very difficult. House Speaker John Boehner, who backs  a broader congressional authorization for action against Bashar Assad, said in March that he had no intention of approving any Syria military action without it.The biggest obstacle to authorizing military strikes against Syria is not a lack of support from congressional Republicans -- most of them, indeed, are opposed to it -- but opposition from the White House itself. It's been reported that White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice has privately told lawmakers that a strike would risk triggering a regional and Western-led bombing campaign and, therefore, could trigger an unwinnable war between the U.S. and Syria, according to U.S. and British officials.Rice, an Obama administration favorite who previously served as his deputy national security adviser, was also an advocate for the intervention in Libya, and now, in an attempt to be as supportive of Obama as possible, she has become the face of the administration’s policy.But her support for the Syria strike is far from clear, and it has caused quite a bit of consternation within the Obama administration. On Sunday, Rice told CBS's "Face the Nation" that "we need a decision... that is made on the basis of the intelligence that we have" in order to launch the strikes, which the White House has requested.The House and Senate Intelligence Committee is now reportedly preparing subpoenas for four witnesses -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; CIA Director John Brennan; U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice; and Susan E. Rice, the wife of the national security adviser -- concerning their participation in the alleged plot against Assad.In the Senate, Democratic Whip Dick Durbin told Politico he would use his "unique" powers to force the intelligence community to make available all of its data on the alleged Syrian chemical attack. "I would take every tool of the intelligence community and I would bring it to bear on this," Durbin said.As far as I am concerned, if the Bush administration had been in charge when George W.

Peter Trimble found his formula through trial and error. A design student at the University of Edinburgh, he was aiming to produce an artistic exhibition for a module on sustainability, when he stumbled on "Dupe," a living alternative to concrete. A lab technician introduced Trimble to Sporosarcina pasteurii, a bacterium with binding qualities, sometimes used to solidify soil to hold road signs in place. The student tested it with one of the world's most abundant resources - sand. Pumping bacterial solution into a sand-filled mould, he added nutrients, urea derived from urine as fertilizer and calcium. After a year, and hundreds of failed experiments, this process manufactured a stool around 70% the compression strength of concrete. The process requires less than one-sixth of the energy used in concrete production, and is completely biodegradable. Crucially, Trimble believes his mechanism has the added benefit that it could be employed by anyone, anywhere. "Once you have the basic framework it should be transferable. Imagine a Tsunami-hit farm in Indonesia that is not getting supplies. You could use sand and bacteria on site, practically free, and have shelter housing that is far more permanent." Trimble is working with NGOs to apply Dupe to Aboriginal settlements and insecure regions of Morocco. But while the applications are new and experimental, the concept of growing the material for our built environment is increasingly regarded as not merely interesting, but essential. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the construction industry accounts for 40% of the world's C02 emissions, 40% of U.S. landfill and has been uniquely resistant to change. Concrete, bricks and cement have remained the dominant materials since the industrial revolution in the early 19th century, and as pressure mounts on resources and climate, scientists and architects are looking to the natural world for solutions. Building bacteria Bacteria have been at the center of alternative methods. North Carolina start-up Biomason is growing bricks on an industrial scale, cultivated from sand by microorganisms. The company has won major prizes and funding for the bricks, which will be used in a structure for the first time this year in a pedestrian walkway, ahead of building projects across the world.	1
Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. "The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons," Lee told Reuters. "Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply." The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and "transplant tourists" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk.	1
Do you want to hit this?" a man asked President Barack Obama in a bar in Denver Tuesday night. The president laughed but didn't indulge. It wasn't the only time Obama was offered weed on his night out. That's apparently what happens in Colorado, which recently legalized recreational marijuana. The man posted the exchange on Instagram for the world to see. Obama has admitted to smoking pot as a young man. He was an active member of the "Choom Gang" in high school, which perfected all sorts of techniques for getting high. The President has since spoken about those times in more serious settings, saying as recently as this year that he made "bad choices" without considering "the harm it could do." Earlier in the evening, the presidential motorcade passed a bearded man holding a sign: "Free weed 4 Obama." A sign outside a marijuana dispensary offered the same thing. The motorcade didn't stop. And Obama waving off the offers didn't seem to ruin the fun. His boys' night out with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper at the bar the governor used to own consisted of, well, things that take place in bars. "Did you see how many balls he still has on the table?" the President joked after a game of pool. Hickenlooper had five, while the President sunk the 8-ball. A patron offered to buy the President a beer. "It's too late, man. I just got one," Obama said. While Obama the bear was loose, the entire night was not all jovial. A woman stopped the President, telling him that her brother died in Afghanistan four years ago. Obama gave Kalynne May Arrick, from Tyler, Texas, a challenge coin usually reserved for veterans, who collect them. Her brother, Marine Sgt. Kenneth May, was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. "I'm so sorry," he told Arrick, hugging her. Presidential meet-and-greets rarely veer so far off script. By the time Obama sat down at a pizza joint with people who had written him letters, the President had loosened his blue tie and rolled up his sleeves. A teacher, a couple who own a small business, a college student, and a furniture store worker sat Obama down at the head of a table crowded with plates and pizza trays. "Where do you all want me?" asked the President. "Right at the head of the table."	1
Shad Gregory Moss hasn't gone by the name Lil' Bow Wow for some time now. But if you squint hard enough and try to ignore the barrage of broad vernacular the 49-year-old rapper uses when he's not singing and rapping about gangland-style bling on "Bow Wow," you might just be able to see him as the young, untainted soul he was back in 1988.Shad Gregory Moss was born in Philadelphia. By age 11, he wanted to become a singer, but his parents instead encouraged him to study computer science at the University of Delaware. After a stint working as an engineer at Disney World, Moss was introduced to fellow singer/songwriter and childhood friend B. D. Wong, who put him in touch with producers who were looking to produce him. Their meeting was a success, and Moss and Wong quickly became friends. When Wong wasn't able to find a place to stay, the two of them wound up in their shared apartment in New York City. They spent several hours talking about music and dreams. There were plenty of those, and all the while Moss was working as a backup vocalist to a band whose leader, an ex-boyfriend of one of his former singing partners, was in the middle of an epic cocaine, vodka, and crack cocaine bender.The two of them went down and spent a few days at a recording studio in the Bronx where Wong was looking for a place to stay. (They both had jobs with the record company.) They made a record, which Moss co-wrote with Wong, and put out an album. Moss was just 18 years old. He had written and performed most of the album's songs, but he had also been recording with Wong in a makeshift studio upstairs in Wong's apartment."This was something I wanted to do, but I guess I was just naive enough to think it would happen," Moss tells Inverse. "I was just in love with the songwriting process and the whole thing of writing and singing. I didn't think it was a possibility."It was only after Moss moved to Boston and began to tour with Wong that he heard about the recording sessions for Lil' Bow Wow. It appeared that Moss was going to have a chance to make a name for himself, not only as a songwriter and singer but as someone who was going to have more success than just working at songwriting gigs with local	0
For better or worse, Iraq and the United States have been attached at the hip for decades. From the 1991 Gulf War to the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein to subsequent years marred by violence and instability, there's no  doubt the two countries have enjoyed a close relationship. But the last two years have witnessed a steady decline in US military operations in Iraq, a drastic shift in American focus to Afghanistan, and the slow but sure destruction of US and Iraqi cooperation, with mixed results for the United States and Iraq.Iraq has seen a string of coups since US-installed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was toppled by US-led forces. These were followed by military coups in 2005 and 2009, which were finally brought to an end by a US invasion. The violence and instability the Iraqi people endured during those coups, which included US-led occupation for four years in order to help Iraqis restore a semblance of stability, was only compounded with the invasion of Iraq in 2003.As the United States has sought to stabilize the Middle East and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and other regional ambitions, the situation in Iraq has been marked by an intensification of violence and instability. With US-led military operations having been largely halted, Iraq's problems have deepened.In this series of articles, I hope to show how Iraq's problems have deepened with the departure of U.S. forces and withdrawal of coalition government forces, while simultaneously, the United States is making a conscious effort to shift military and political focus to Afghanistan. The Iraqi people will suffer the consequences of US disengagement in the long years ahead, but the United States has already lost their trust, and many Iraqis have expressed the belief that the United States won't come back, or is simply unwilling to do so. The United States, on the other hand, could very well do so.Iraq and the US Relationship: Iraq's TroublesIraq was in a downward spiral of violence and corruption prior to the US invasion. The United States' invasion in 2003 brought about a short-term stabilization of Iraq, but it did little to address the underlying causes of the country's problems, such as the high rate of inflation, large budget deficits, a growing unemployment rate, and a lack of basic services.In the first few years after the invasion, Iraq was characterized by the rise of violent gangs such as the Islamic State of Iraq , Al Qaeda in Iraq , and various other	0
Across the country, insurance companies, trial lawyers and legislators are closely watching a November referendum in the state of Washington that could change how insurers are required to treat their customers. Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state. Insurance giants like Allstate, State Farm, Safeco and Farmers have poured more than $8 million into the referendum battle. Their goal is to convince voters to reject a law passed earlier this year that could force insurers to pay up to triple damages and lawyer fees if they fail to pay a legitimate claim and then lose in court. A "yes" vote on the referendum allows the law to go into effect while a "no" vote strikes the law down. Supporters of the law say it forces insurance companies to pay legitimate claims in a timely and fair fashion and frees the courts from relatively minor cases that clog the system for months and even years. One supporter, the Washington Trial Lawyers Association, has raised almost $900,000 to fight the insurance industry over the referendum. "Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby. Kirby and his fellow Washington state lawmakers heard so many complaints from policy holders who believed insurers weren't treating them fairly that earlier this year they passed a law called "The Fair Conduct Act." Hearings were held, the bill was revised -- even watered down, according to Kirby -- and both the House and Senate passed it. The governor readily signed it. But the very next day a coalition, funded primarily by insurance companies, moved in to stop the law from going into effect by filing petitions for a voter referendum on the law. Representatives of the insurance industry say the law will raise premiums and that the system is working fine as it is. The law, they said, will only make things worse, and they want voters to have the final say. "The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law. Childers said the state's own insurance commissioner sees no need for the law. "His own information that he provided to the legislature and the public says that this law simply isn't necessary,'' Childers said.	1
A patent application filed by Apple reveals an interesting possible development of iPad's Smart Cover, which may get a display  screen this year.The invention will offer a unique and innovative way for users to interact with a small screen of iPad without having to look at the touchscreen itself.The user can interact with the smart cover through the use of the stylus, which is placed in the opening of smart cover. This allows the user to control the cover through the stylus in a manner similar to how we've long used the trackball, while still having the convenience of seeing the screens for which we're using the smart cover.This particular feature could potentially prove an amazing way to enhance a notebook computer or similar.So far, we've seen iPads become somewhat mainstream, with several models now being available on various Apple's platforms.

Lynsey Addario was five months pregnant and taking photos of skeletal children in the Horn of Africa, when she felt her own baby kicking for the first time. "He came to life as a little person inside me as I entered Somalia,  a country I had never seen and would never visit. I fell in love with the country that I was living in, " says Addario, now 35.Addario and her partner, Ali Mohamed, were on a journey to flee famine and civil war in Ethiopia, along with thousands of others from the Horn of Africa. In September, they packed their bags and boarded a ship bound for Europe. After three weeks, Addario was given a visa to enter Switzerland, and her baby, the couple's first, was born in January 2004.The journey from Africa to Europe had been arduous and dangerous, but the couple's story was not typical. In most cases, refugees are forced to take one of two paths: First they move internally to the countries that are hosting them, where conditions of life are poor. Then they are expelled to other countries, often to countries with a less favorable reception for refugees. While Ethiopia was a relatively stable country, where their refugee status would quickly be granted, the rest of Africa was full of violence, chaos and misery. By March, the team had been caught in a cycle of misery for months. They survived by moving constantly from one country to the next, without access to legal status or resources.When Addario and her baby arrived in Geneva, where the couple's legal status was already in the process of being established, there was little they could do to bring them forward to the next step. But the team at UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, had a message for them. They said, "You have to be here," and they launched a campaign to get Addario, and others like her, to the next stage of refugee status. And they did it by using a simple but powerful idea: a legal instrument called a protection visa."The system of protection visas is a system that enables people to move around the world to places where their rights and access to services are not adequately protected. We were able to secure it for them so that they could safely move ahead in the international community," says Elizabeth Anderson, UNHCR's manager for protection and support visas.Addario, now in London, says the move was a new beginning for her.	0
Before a deadly fire that burned a home in Annapolis, Maryland, technology executive Don Pyle and his wife, Sandra, spent a day with their four grandchildren. The day included shopping for costumes, dinner at the Medieval Times restaurant and a sleepover at Pyle's waterfront mansion. Monday was a school holiday, and the children -- Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6 -- stayed over, a family spokeswoman said. Pyle, his wife and the four grandchildren are now feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed the mansion early Monday morning. Authorities have recovered four bodies from the ruins. They continue to search for the others. The smiling grandchildren and their grandparents are seen in images released by family members, who described a boundless and unconditional bond between the victims. • Lexi loved her sister and new baby brother, her classmates, field hockey, lacrosse and ice skating, the family said in a statement Friday. "She was thoughtful, social, smart, and determined," according to the family. "She loved her dog Sophie. Her favorite adventures included trips with her parents, grandparents, and cousins. Lexi wanted to be a vet or on television when she grew up. She was going to be famous." • Katie loved her family and her new brother, the statement said. She was described as a kind and compassionate girl who enjoyed soccer, gymnastics, ice skating and singing to Taylor Swift. Her recent adventures included her birthday party with the Baltimore Ravens cheerleaders and a trip to New York City. "Having just turned 7, she was loving and thoughtful beyond her years," the statement said. • Charlotte loved her family, horses, basketball and swimming. Her friend held a special place in her heart, the statement said. "She was fun-loving, intelligent, and kind," the statement said. "She wanted to be known as a gamer with an epic love of Minecraft. Charlotte loved making videos with her guinea pig, Oreo. Charlotte's future dreams were to run an animal rescue." • Wes loved his friends and family, Doctor Who, Legos, Minecraft, Plants vs Zombies and swimming, according to the family.	1
Michael Jackson's father filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against Dr. Conrad Murray on Friday, the anniversary of the pop star's death, Joe Jackson's lawyer said. The suit alleges that Murray gave paramedics and doctors false information about the "polypharmacy" of drugs Michael Jackson had been given and hindered efforts to revive him in an ambulance and at UCLA Medical Center, according to a copy obtained by CNN. The suit said that "other parties responsible for Michael Jackson's death" would be added but that the plaintiff "has not yet gathered sufficient information regarding their potential liability or responsibility." A complaint filed by Joe Jackson with the California medical board this month also named AEG, the company that was producing his son's comeback concerts. Murray was hired to serve as Jackson's personal doctor two months before the London debut of the concerts were set. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Michael Jackson's death was caused by an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia that Murray has acknowledged the pop star used to help him sleep. Joe Jackson attorney Brian Oxman obtained a court order this year giving him medical records from UCLA Medical Center, where Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. The suit also alleges that Murray delayed calling for paramedics for over an hour, after he found Jackson not breathing minutes after he injected him with propofol to help him fall asleep. The suit contends that Murray used the time to hide evidence of drugs he had been giving Jackson. When the ambulance carrying Michael Jackson from his home arrived at the emergency room at 1:13 p.m., he was identified as "Soule Shaun," the suit said. He had "no pulse, blood pressure, spontaneous respiration or heartbeat," it said. Murray, who had taken over control of resuscitation efforts from paramedics, said nothing to emergency room doctors about the propofol or "other drugs" he had given Michael Jackson earlier in the day, it said. It quoted a report written the next day by one of those doctors, who wrote that Murray told them "the patient had been working long hours but had not been ill." "The only reported medications reported for the patient were valium and Flomax," Dr. Richelle Cooper wrote. "There is no history of drug use by the patient as reported by Dr. Murray." A police report said Murray told investigators two days later that "he was afraid Michael Jackson was addicted to propofol."	1
The ever-expanding outbreak of life-threatening fungal meningitis in back pain patients linked to steroid injections prepared by a compounding pharmacy, which so far has sickened at least 214 people and killed 15 in 15 states, is a public health catastrophe. What is ick is that the majority of patients who experienced this kind of harm had no previous history of serious allergic reactions – and, in most cases, received only a single dose of the steroid.“We have a public health crisis on our hands. The most common symptoms of this kind of fungal meningitis are headache, fever, lethargy, chills, neck pain, stiff neck, fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, diarrhea, confusion, and even seizures,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of fungal meningitis usually appear 4 to 24 hours after exposure, and are usually preceded by a flu-like illness. Symptoms can last more than a week.So far, at least eight patients have died from the meningitis outbreak, according to the Associated Press. Two men also received steroid injections that were contaminated with bloodborne pathogens at a compounding pharmacy in Kentucky. One patient in Tennessee also suffered from meningitis and a second patient in Virginia is thought to have died from a fungal meningitis.The CDC is currently coordinating a nationwide investigation into the source of the outbreak, which is not yet fully understood.The most common symptoms of fungal meningitis are headache, fever, lethargy, chills, neck pain, stiff neck, fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, diarrhea, confusion, and even seizures. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)Families and individuals who’ve been victims of contaminated steroid injections are calling for tighter regulation of compounding pharmacies in an effort to protect other patients.“When someone has to go that route, it’s better to know it’s dangerous,” said Dr. David Fritsch, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.“So far, we don’t know what has caused this outbreak just yet, but we are certain that it was related to steroid injections performed by a compounding health care professional.”Fungal Meningitis Is a Boon to Steroid Users – How Did This Happen?	0
Bayern Munich have pulled off a major coup by successfully courting arguably the most in-demand coach in the world -- Pep Guardiola. One day after Guardiola had talked openly of his desire to manage in the English Premier League, Bayern announced the 41-year-old Catalan had agreed to coach the German club for three seasons from the start of the 2013/2014 campaign. "Pep Guardiola is one of the most successful coaches in the world and we are sure that he can give not just Bayern, but the German football, lots of shine. We look forward to working with him from July 2013," Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness told the club's website. The 41-year-old Guardiola stepped down as Barcelona coach at the end of last season after four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs to take a year-long sabbatical. Bayern told CNN there would be no further announcements before the German season resumes on Saturday. Guardiola enjoyed a hugely successful spell at the Camp Nou, guiding the Catalan club to 14 major honors including three league titles and two European Champions League triumphs. The news of Guardiola's appointment coincided with the announcement that 67-year-old current Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes will be retiring from coaching. "FC Bayern today announces that head coach Jupp Heynckes has decided to retire when his current contract expires on 30 June 2013," read a statement on the German league leader's website. "In his place, the club has appointed Pep Guardiola as head coach for three years from 1 July 2013." Blog: What can we expect from 2013 CAN? Heynckes is currently in his third spell as Bayern coach having taken over from Dutchman Louis van Gaal in 2011. After a second-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, Heynckes' team lead the table by nine points at the halfway stage of the 2012/13 campaign. Guardiola had been heavily linked with a move to England, with Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all rumored to be interested in appointing him. The former Barca captain seemed to fuel those rumors by telling the English Football Association's website: "I've always found English football very fascinating, just for the environment, the crowd and the supporters.	1
Lately, Dan McMullen has been bringing an extra gun to his office in Ferguson, Missouri. McMullen runs Solo Insurance on West Florissant close to where looting and vandalism briefly broke out in early August after a police officer shot to death teenager Michael Brown. "I bring an extra gun now only because it has a bigger magazine," McMullen says. He began carrying it after tensions increased in the area following the shooting. He says he would never use it to protect his business, but he would use it to save his life. "So maybe I get trapped here or something and have to have a John Wayne shootout," McMullen says before interrupting himself, smiling. "That's the silly part about it: Is that going to happen? Not a chance. But I guess, could it? I'm the only white person here." McMullen is particularly cautious now, as all of Ferguson and much of the nation waits to see whether a grand jury will indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting. Though the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come in mid-November. McMullen warns others considering getting a gun not to be reckless. When his adult son told him he wanted a gun to protect himself after the grand jury decision, McMullen warned him not to rush into it. "People like him need to think about it, and not think about 'I'm worried about this stuff,' " McMullen says. On Monday, Steven King, who owns Metro Shooting Supplies, told CNN that customers bought 100 guns this weekend. A typical weekend brings in about 30 buyers. "People are afraid they are gonna throw Molotov cocktails," says King, referring to the mostly nonviolent protests that have taken place in Ferguson since the shooting. The increase in gun sales reaches across racial and ethnic lines, he says. "A lot of black people are coming in saying they are afraid of the hooliganism," he says. "But not all of Ferguson is hooliganish. The media portrays us that way. If the world can just see this is one little street in Ferguson going crazy, they'd understand that we're not just one big burning city." At Metro Shooting Range in nearby Bridgeton, Missouri, manager John Stephenson says gun sales are up 40 to 50% as of last week.	1
Poaching tourists from the trendy tango bars of Buenos Aires or the glamorous beaches of Rio de Janeiro would be a tall task for most cities. But the Chilean capital, Santiago, is looking to do just that by encouraging travelers passing  under the city’s iconic bridge to stop and take photos of the monument that houses the country’s crown jewel, the Iguazu Falls.The bridge itself, the Puente de la Concepción, was built in 1877 as a toll bridge, and as such has been the site of a number of accidents involving motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians, that have led to both fatalities and hospitalizations among the thousands of people who have crossed it over the course of its nearly 300-year history. When it was first planned, it was built of wood, but when the city’s population boom began in the 1950s, Santiago began replacing the wooden structure with iron, which turned the bridge into a danger zone. That is, until the Santiago Metropolitan Council decided to finally replace the bridge and pay for it to be repaired by building a stone structure above the current metal beams. It’s a decision that Santiago Mayor, Sergio Bergman, is pleased with.“The idea of building a bridge that isn’t really a bridge, but rather a bridge that is part of a public plaza that we can use and that has a more beautiful public plaza than the plaza [at the foot of the bridge] that we have, is an important one. It’s an opportunity to really improve public spaces such as the Plaza de Armas and to improve the street life of the city,” Bergman told me by phone recently.With the new bridge, the Plaza de Armas is on an entirely new level. The former plaza, which had been at the foot of the bridge with its statues of politicians and soldiers, was now a plaza that was part of a public space that was built above a narrow concrete-reinforced footbridge over the Iguazu River, which is the city’s main channel.The plaza was designed by Santiago architect and design consultant Hernan Ortega. According to him, the idea was to create something that looked like a public square, rather than something that looked like something a public square should look like. But it’s not just the plaza that has been given a makeover.	0
Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is "not a fit person" to run a major international company, British lawmakers investigating phone hacking at his tabloid News of the World reported Tuesday. The ruling could prompt British regulators to force him to sell Â¡24 News Corp., his publishing group, to a media investor that would then take charge of Britainâs No. 2 newspaper.News of the World reporter Glenn Mulcaire will be sentenced to jail time and serve almost a third of his 18 month sentence next month for his part in phone hacking and other crimes at this British newspaper.Mulcaire, who has already been ordered to stand trial, is fighting the charges in British court.The British parliament is going to investigate the Murdoch family and the News of the World, as well as phone-hacking by the newspaper, in an attempt to prevent media and privacy violations in a country where government, law and media are closely intertwined.The investigation may set a precedent for other media giants and their publishers, especially when it comes to phone-hacking or other violations of the publicâs right to privacy. However, the allegations of government and law violations are not new. The News of the World made waves as far back as 1992, when the United Kingdomâs Parliament considered the potential violation of civil rights by News of the World. While lawmakers said it would be illegal to withhold documents and phone records from the public, they didnât give prosecutors an indictment against the paper.The News of the Worldâs phone records were kept for two decades without ever going to police. The paper also hired a private investigator to look into private affairs, including allegations that the Murdochs had hired prostitutes in Ireland. The paper and its publisher, who have both denied the claims, were investigated a year before the phone hacking scandal broke.âA few years ago MPs and police were asking when they would get something against the News of the World,â said David Cameron, Britainâs prime minister, who is leading the governmentâs charge on phone hacking. âThis shows that some members of our government and media should wake up to the fact that the law needs to be enforced.âThe British	0
Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation. Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles. Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was "responding well and recuperating" Thursday, her publicist said. Cole had been on what she called "a very long list" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match. It was a "directed donation" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. "Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match," Mone said. Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said. The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said. Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live" on March 31. "I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors," said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. "I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body." Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.	1
Fred Berretta was aboard US Airways Flight 1549 bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he heard a loud bang and the plane shook. The New York Fire Department rescued passengers from the downed plane in the Hudson River. "We were still on ascent, and the engine blew out," he said. "The pilot turned around and made a line for the river." Passenger Alberto Panero said that immediately, he smelled smoke. "All of a sudden, the captain came on and said brace for a landing, and that's when we knew we were going down," he said. The Airbus A320, carrying Panero and more than 150 other passengers and crew, crash-landed in the Hudson River on Thursday after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York.  Watch Jeff Kolodjay describe the crash » A New Jersey State Police source told CNN the pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency. "We knew there wasn't a lot of time because we were quite close to the ground, and it felt as though the descent was somewhat rapid," said Berretta, who said he was sitting in seat 16A.  Watch Berretta describe the landing » As the plane headed down toward the river, the cabin was mostly silent, he said. "After he told us prepare for impact, it was pretty evident we were not going to make the runway." At first, it felt like the plane was gliding, Berretta said, as if no engines were working. "People started praying, and there was a lot of silence, and the realization that we were going in was really hard to take in at that moment," he said. As the plane started to go down, some passengers shouted to those in exit rows to be prepared to quickly open the doors. Berretta spent that time contemplating the chances of surviving a water crash. "I think that [it] certainly went through my mind that this probably very much could be it," he said. Then the plane hit the water. Panero said the impact felt like a car crash. Some said that as the plane hit, there were extremely loud noises. "The plane was jockeying about, spinning a bit," Berretta said. "Then all of a sudden, it was 'Get out, get out now,' " Panero said.	1
Is it too soon to make a horror film inspired by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which a vast area of the world was  covered in ash and burned to the ground, resulting in the highest levels of radiation ever recorded by mankind? In response to the film, one of the filmmakers who made it, Andrey Zvyagintsev, claims to have filmed his film “a couple of years later” than the original story.While I don’t claim to be able to provide a definitive answer based on a few short sentences, let’s look at whether there is any reason to think that the Chernobyl film was shot “a couple of years” later than was originally supposed to be the case or that the director of the film was “forced” into making it earlier.According to Andrey Zvyagintsev (who is also the author of the screenplay of the original 1986 Chernobyl story), the Chernobyl disaster happened on April 26, 1986.The first evidence of the disaster that happened in 1986 comes from a document with the title "Official Declaration of Damage and Radioactivity" from the Russian Federation. [Chernobyl in the media]Based on this document, it was estimated that the fire at the Chernobyl nuclear plant caused 20.2 million radiation doses. Of these, more than 8.8 million were recorded in Ukraine (where the fire started) and more than 1.8 million in Belarus (where the fire spread further due to the lack of communication between the two countries).Chernobyl in the mediaThe first film about the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster was made in 1987. The director of the film was Andrei Mironov. Since the story was very well known by this point, there is not much in the film that would need to be changed. The film was released on video in the summer of 1987. According to Andrey Zvyagintsev, the film was shot "a couple of years" after the story was told. He also added that this was the only way he could get his film shown in the state and foreign film festivals.Chernobyl in the mediaIn 1991, the film was released in Russia. In 1992, in Germany, the film was awarded Best European Film and was awarded the Stig Dagerman prize. The film was also awarded by the	0
Every third Monday in January we gather as Americans to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His tireless advocacy for civil rights, equal protection under the law, labor rights, and for the ultimate realization of our essential creed that we are "one nation, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is taught in every school in America, and is now enshrined in a memorial on the National Mall. Dr. King believed so strongly not only in these values, but also in the moral imperative to heed the "fierce urgency of now." He knew that in the face of injustice no moral man or woman can stay silent -- and he paid for it with his life. He was a "drum major for justice" He inspired us -- not just with his eloquent sermons, rich in purpose; or his speeches, inspiring and provocative -- but he challenged us with his dream, his daring imagination: to see an America where all of God's children would be equal; all of God's children would have a seat at the table. Dr. King, along with other men and women of his generation did not just see the barriers. They believed in the opportunities that could be realized if we could just move beyond racial inequality and injustice. He truly believed that we had to "take the first step in faith, even when you don't see the whole staircase." Just take the first step. I've written and spoken about Dr. King many times, but this year, one area of his crusade seems particularly worthy of remembrance: the fight for the ballot. Prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African-Americans and many others faced regular and malicious restrictions to the free exercise of their constitutionally protected right to vote, especially in my native South. Literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses: many insidious techniques were used by certain states to restrict, confuse, and write off, marginalize and disenfranchise so many eligible citizens from voting simply because of the color of their skin. Southern governors and those in Washington comfortable with the status quo hid behind arguments about "states rights." Yet these laws were little more than legislated racism and all knew the real goal behind their unequal effects. In a 1957 speech titled "Give Us The Ballot," Dr. King spoke plainly about the imperative of equal voting rights.	1
South Korea said Wednesday that it had put a satellite in orbit for the first time, giving a lift to its homegrown space industry and matching a feat achieved last month by its hostile neighbor, North Korea. Amid a billowing plume of ersatz space debris, a satellite launched into a geostationary orbit Thursday by the Asian country's top space agency carried an array of scientific and commercial experiments on technology, health and education. The satellite, called Kwangmyongsong-1 or "Sunrise 1," also carried an array of experiments for a U.S. firm and a South Korean company, officials of both countries said. The South Korean agency built and launched the satellite, which is 10.7 inches long and measures 4.4 centimeters in diameter, according to its specifications.The experiment included an array of instruments on board that will study and test communications and medical technology, a U.S. company official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the experiment was confidential. It will also study the effectiveness of the air conditioner's cooling system on the satellite, said the official, who added that Kwangmyongsong-1 will study the technology of a medical diagnosis device and "biological data." The experiment will be able to observe the effects of sunlight on humans, and will study how the body responds to the sun's rays, said the official.The agency, called the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, had previously developed a satellite with scientific experiments that are similar to those of Kwangmyongsong-1, the official said. The U.S. company, which did not provide a name, performed experiments in its laboratories on the ground in the United States. The institute "provided a scientific space mission system that is very high in quality and excellence, and also in an international standard," the official said. The U.S. company's experiments in the United States will be carried out on Kwangmyongsong-1, the official said, but the company will still conduct its own experiments by using the satellite. The experiments were conducted by the U.S. company on earth, and the experiments on board the satellite were conducted by the institute, officials said. The Korean Aerospace Research Institute and the U.S. company do not disclose the content of the experiments conducted on Kwangmyongsong-1.The U.N.

If you don't get the job done at work, you won't get paid. But Congress plays by its own rules. Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years. This is basic -- and required by law. Congress seems   To understand why Congress   has had so little to say about its budget and so much to say about its wars,   read a few words of it into   the record.   I'm talking about the $1.4 trillion that Congress appropriated to the Department of Defense in July   2010. It does not address the Department of   Homeland Security's budget of $8.7 and a half   trillion. Nor does it address the separate budget for the other agencies of the federal government.   Of course, Congress controls its own budget process. One reason is because the Constitution gives Congress   the power to appropriate money. Another is because the Constitution gives   Congress the power to "make all laws which are necessary and proper" to govern the government.   Why hasn't Congress acted?   The Constitution doesn't say. A Supreme Court decision in 1935 and other court decisions in the past say.   So why isn't Congress doing its job?   A recent survey   showed that three out of four of those surveyed were unsure of the reason for inaction in Congress. There are a lot of reasons it could be uncertain, but two were most important.

For consumers, the news that the Department of Justice is suing Apple and several publishers, accusing them of price-fixing, boils down to one kitchen-table question: Will this mean my e-books will get cheaper? ## Why this is newsworthyThe news that Justice Department attorneys are suing Apple and several publishers has many reasons to be interesting. ### For publishersFor a lot of publishers, this is about the worst thing that could have happened.It shows that, even after five years of a great deal of pressure from Congress and the public, the Justice Department still won't even consider that a company could be a price-fixing "cartel." And it shows that, even after almost five years of trying to get in serious trouble with the government, publishers have not learned their lesson. They were caught with their pants down — so to speak — because they tried to gouge consumers and, instead, paid billions in fines.### For consumersFor consumers, the news that the Department of Justice is suing Apple and several publishers is a big deal. If e-Books are indeed getting cheaper, and many consumers think they are, this could mean that it will now cost more to buy and read e-Books. As more and more e-Books become available, consumers will have to pay more and more for them.And, this could mean that e-Book prices could rise until, well, the time when most of us stop reading them, if not before.### How it happenedThis is what happened. Apple, Google, Amazon, Barnes & Noble and a whole host of other companies are trying to make e-Books cheaper than the paper versions.In the past, e-Book publishers have tried to make them cheaper by allowing publishers to mark up prices by a couple of percentage points. But the government stopped them, claiming that such anticompetitive practices would likely hurt competition. ##   **What's the big deal?**Why should we pay more for books when Amazon has the same books as we do and for which we get the same service free of charge?The biggest reasons are that we've learned that e-Books are more convenient than paper books and that we want the convenience we get from e-Books.In fact, we've learned that e-Books are a lot better than	0
It's getting a lot of chatter, but is it real? A new story about some New Jersey hospitals seeing a spike in births nine months after Superstorm Sandy has sparked talk that there just might be a post-Sandy baby boom. Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch is seeing a 35% jump, and two other hospitals are seeing 20% increases, a review by the Asbury Park Press found. It's the latest in a series of reports suggesting that when Mother Nature knocked out the power, some couples who were cooped up at home let nature take its course there, too. As CNN's Susan Candiotti reported in March, some doctors have been overwhelmed with business. "It got to the point where we had to stop seeing new obstetrical patients to the practice," said Dr. Robert Rubino, who runs an OB/GYN practice in West Orange, New Jersey. "We think we have a Sandy baby," Rubino's patient Meredith Swormstedt and her husband Hank told CNN. Stephanie Tych and Brian Boruch said the same. "Well, there was no TV," Boruch said, blushing. Tych put it this way: "We just got closer." For these couples, there's no doubt that Sandy -- amid all its destruction -- led to something joyous. A study suggests some natural disasters lead to an increase in pregnancies -- not where the destruction is most severe, but in areas that are affected and remain livable. "You may run out of power, but you're not running for your life. There's probably more opportunities for reproductive behavior," says Richard Evans, an assistant professor at Brigham Young University and author of the 2007 study "The Fertility Effect of Catastrophe." In 2009, CNN affiliate KPRC reported on some hospitals seeing an increase in births after Hurricane Ike. But some hospitals in the area struck by Sandy are not reporting any increase in birth rates nine months after the storm. Sandy still bringing down homes, but families vow to be back New York City's Mount Sinai hasn't seen any such spike, Dr. Raymond Sandler, head of labor and delivery for the hospital, told CNN on Wednesday. The idea that people have more babies after natural disasters is "just not documented," he says. "I don't know why people are even saying it."	1
Congress set off for a two-week recess Friday, flying out of Washington under a dark cloud: the "Do-nothing" label. But that term is too easy. If you take a closer look, it turns out the better fit may be the  "do-the-least" label.Indeed, even before the latest government funding impasse, the most striking fact about the 115th Congress of the United States has been not its numbers, but its tone. In many ways, it has the feel of a junior high school assembly where the students are still learning how to use their scissors.It's not that they're rude; it's how they speak — with a tone of voice that's meant to be friendly rather than hostile. It's as if the speaker is trying to get a group of kids to feel like it's a fun event rather than a grilling. If you listen on social media and talk to those in Congress, they all seem to be from the same family, friends, or neighborhood."There's this group of senators who seem to be having a blast, and in my book, they're not doing anything," said Ron Brown, a Republican from Texas, who chaired the House Appropriations Committee from 2007 until this year. "It's pretty much all in good fun. They're not taking anything seriously."Another Republican who had a role in the chamber often described as one of the most dysfunctional in living memory, Jim Gerlach, said he had "a really good time" as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee."I'd like to see how many times we talk about a bill, or how many times we go over the same issue," he said. "We're not that serious about it."But with more spending than any nation has ever demanded, in some cases exceeding more than the size of the economy itself, the problem is there's a cost to such carelessness, and it is indeed serious.In December, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported a $6.6 trillion federal debt, which is equal to about $16,000 for every man, woman and child in America. That's more debt than all the countries in the world combined, and it is projected to grow by another $6 trillion over the next decade. In a single month in January, it grew to $25 trillion, which represents nearly a third of the U	0
A previously unpublished collection of photographs from the wedding of John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy will be auctioned this month. The negatives of the photographs were found in 1993 in the darkroom of Arthur Burges, a World War II veteran and freelance photographer who was hired as a backup photographer for the wedding, according to Bobby Livingston, an executive vice president at RR Auction. "They're relatively scarce," Livingston said. "To come across a photo archive like this of such a famous event, they're a nice find." The future first couple was married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island. The event was also famously displayed in LIFE magazine with shots by photographer Lisa Larsen, according to Rachel Flor of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. The magazine called the wedding "the most impressive the old society stronghold had seen in 30 years." Letters reveal private thoughts of young Jackie Kennedy Burges' photos, or the "outtakes," as the auction house refers to them, include shots of the couple exiting the church and cutting the wedding cake. According to a press release from the Kennedy Museum, the wedding cake had five tiers and was accompanied by "a luncheon of fruit cup, creamed chicken and ice cream sculpted to resemble roses." Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding dress, captured in Burges' black and white stills, was made from 50 yards of ivory silk taffeta and took more than two months to make, according to the museum. Livingston estimated the collection of 13 shots will sell for several thousand dollars. The photos are being auctioned online through October 15. 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view	1
A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants on Wednesday, intelligence officials told CNN. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the suspected drone fired two missiles on a militant hideout Â»Â¶Â¶Â¶Pakistani media say an American drone strike is suspected of killing several militants in the country's northwest province of Balochistan on Wednesday. The strikes, announced by the country's army, are the latest in a series from the US in Pakistan, and mark a shift in tactics by the unmanned aerial vehicles. Reports on Tuesday said an American drone killed eight suspected militants in Pakistan's border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The strike came two weeks after three suspected militants were killed by one or more U.S. drones in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Here's what you need to know about drone strikes in Pakistan:What is a drone?A drone is an unmanned airborne vehicle that can be fitted with a camera and remotely controlled. They are operated remotely, usually from a command location hundreds of miles away. Such drones are not capable of precision attacks like cruise missiles or small-arms fire, and they are not designed to kill enemy combatants themselves. But they can carry out covert, precision strikes against targets they choose.A U.S. intelligence report released earlier this month concluded that the strikes in Pakistan are directed by the CIA, with at least 60 percent of the strikes being carried out by unmanned aircraft.How many drones are in Pakistan?There are seven operational drones in the country, according to the military's media office, and several other models are kept at a U.S. base near Karachi, Pakistan.There are also at least four drones that are not fully operational, according to The Associated Press, citing Pakistanis familiar with the drones.One of those is a drone that can be fitted with a camera and fly in low to the ground for surveillance purposes, according to the military's briefing with reporters in Islamabad on Wednesday.Another drone that cannot fly, but could conceivably be fitted with a camera is located in Peshawar, Pakistan, according to The New York Times. Another drone that can only fly at certain times is still being examined in Peshawar, and could be taken to Pakistan's Khyber tribal region for attacks, The Times reports, citing Pakistani officials.The military	0
Jack White left his Radio City Music Hall audience confused and angry on Saturday night when he abruptly left the stage and ended the show after only playing for about 55 minutes. Over the short course of a 12-song set backed by his all-male band, White stuck mostly to his new material with high-energy takes on "Sixteen Saltines" and "Hypocritical Kiss," plus four White Stripes songs; he sprinted to the piano for a new version of "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" and strapped on his Telecaster for an epic "Ball and Biscuit." Despite the crowd's visible enthusiasm, White seemed displeased with its energy level. "Jesus Christ, is this an NPR convention?" he asked after "Love Interruption" -- a perplexing statement, since the entire floor was standing and cheering. (Later, he asked the crowd to quiet down, "because I can't hear myself think." They cheered anyway.) White regularly eggs on his crowds with sarcastic banter. At one point, he also suggested performing the rest of the show acoustically, which he joked only ten percent of fans would want. Jack White Drops Video Directed by Hype Williams Soon afterward, White made a short announcement before leaving the stage, leaving some fans wondering if it was just an intermission (maybe he'd be returning with his all-female band?) or a ploy for encore hype. The audience stuck around for several minutes after White's disappearance, expecting him to return even as roadies emerged to unplug instruments and shut off the amps. The waiting crowd broke into a "Seven Nation Army" singalong, but once the curtain went down, the song quickly devolved into booing and some shouting of "F--- Jack White." Premiere: Jack White Jams in the Woods at Outside Lands According to the New York Observer, the ushers at the concert seemed equally mystified by its early ending, and a member of the security team later offered an explanation to the reporter. "He wasn't happy with the sound," he said. "I don't know why he pulled that." The paper also noted that White had several "angry exchanges" with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security. After clearing the auditorium, a loud and disgruntled crowd of about 100 fans reportedly gathered outside the venue near the main backstage exit, banging on parked cars.

The shocking video of James Foley being beheaded in Syria has set off multiple investigations into the mystery of who killed the American journalist. A day after the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country are close to identifying the killer, two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that counterterrorism experts are still unable to ID Foley's executioner. U.S. analysts said it's not knowable from the video released by ISIS who carried out Foley's killing, because the entire slaying is not shown. A man moves a knife across Foley's neck, then the picture fades to black. Now one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video. It's one of several puzzles, but there are a number of clues as to who committed this horrible act and where. 1. Accent The focus has been on a man in the video who has a British accent. Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that British agents have been using "very sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on" to identify the suspect.  "We are very close to identifying who this guy is," he said. Martin Barry, an audio expert, told CNN it sounded like the way someone in a certain area of London would talk. "The speaker is using a variety of English known as multicultural London English and that's a kind of melting pot accent that's emerged in recent years, particularly in deprived, multi-ethnic areas of inner London," Barry said. There is only one voice heard on the audio track. 2. Stature But Ross Patel, a forensics expert who spoke to CNN, said there is another man, and he might be the actual killer. The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit. "There's definitely a change of actor," Patel said. "There are noticeable, there are subtle but there are also noticeable changes in their build, their physical appearance." The video contains other data like the measurements of a face, even though it is hidden. That could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos. 3. Knives The man who speaks holds a knife in one of his hands. It looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to Foley's body. The dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different, Patel said. 4. Holster	1
Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on FBI insider W. Mark Felt as a reliable but anonymous source for their stories on the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. Carl Bernstein says "Deep Throat's" information on Watergate was "absolutely invaluable." Felt, referred to as "Deep Throat" in the Washington Post stories and in Woodward and Bernstein's book "All the President's Men," died Thursday in California at 95. He revealed his identity for the first time in 2005. Bernstein never met Felt until this year, but praised his courage during an interview Friday on CNN's "American Morning." AM: What are your thoughts on the occasion of Mark Felt's death? Bernstein: I think it's a little emotional, even though he was 95 years old. He was integral to our coverage. He was one of many sources in Watergate who had both the intelligence and the courage to tell the truth. And in his own organization he was one of the few, and he was near the top. What his information enabled us to do was to confirm stories that we had really obtained elsewhere, more than anything else, rather than give us that much primary information. But it was invaluable, and he performed a great act of courage and national service.  Watch a video obituary of W. Mark Felt » AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in "All the President's Men" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, "I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail." Was that an accurate portrayal? Bernstein: Yeah. Yeah, that's what we did. But his knowledge gave us a grounding and assurance that we were right in what we were saying and reporting. [He gave us] a certainty in a situation where you had the leader of the free world attacking the press every day, making our conduct -- Woodward's, myself's, the Washington Post's -- the issue in Watergate rather than the conduct of the president and his men. So I think Mark Felt's confirming this information (and occasionally he gave us some important information that we hadn't obtained, toward the end, elsewhere), it was absolutely invaluable. AM: It was always Bob Woodward's intention to keep the identity of Deep Throat secret until the occasion of Mark Felt's death.	1
The head of ACORN on Tuesday sharply deplored recent videos showing some of the group's workers advising people how to set up a prostitution business. ACORN leader Bertha Lewis defends her group at the National Press Club on Tuesday in Washington. "It made my stomach turn," Bertha Lewis, chief executive officer of ACORN, told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. "It just made you sick." ACORN workers who did perform their tasks properly "did not deserve to have co-workers who did not live up to their standards," Lewis said. "So yes, I terminated those employees." At the same time, Lewis defended the community organizing group and punched back at widespread criticism, touting the group's efforts in helping poor people in the areas of housing and voting. She backed up the group's legal action in Maryland against the makers of one of the videos. Video, shot with a hidden camera, shows conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute. Lewis said that "we want to hold them accountable" for what she said was breaking the law. Similar videos were made at other ACORN offices. "It is illegal, as Linda Tripp will tell you, to record someone in the state of Maryland without their permission. Just because we were embarrassed by these highly edited tapes, which don't tell the whole story again, and hopefully that will come out, doesn't mean that these people didn't break the law in order to embarrass and attack the organization," Lewis said. Lewis was referring to the former White House employee who recorded conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky about her sexual encounters with President Clinton, which ultimately led to his impeachment. ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- was in the headlines during last year's presidential campaign after GOP allegations of falsifying voter registration applicants. Some of its voter registration workers were prosecuted, and some other employees resigned. But after the recent release of videos, the political criticism grew. In the videos, some ACORN workers advised the undercover conservative activists how to set up a prostitution business involving underage, foreign girls. Along with firing employees, ACORN also is conducting an investigation through an independent auditor. The Justice and Treasury departments are investigating the group, too. The U.S. Census Bureau has terminated ACORN's involvement in its public outreach program, both chambers of Congress have voted to deny federal funding to the organization, and several states are looking into ACORN operations.	1

In a television interview, the mother of a man charged in the murder of an Auburn University freshman repeatedly says she's sorry about the suffering the victim's family is enduring. Courtney Larrell Lockhart was arrested Friday in Phenix City, Alabama, about 35 miles from Auburn. "I never thought Courtney would do this. I never, never thought," Courtney Larrell Lockhart's mother Catherine Williams told CNN affiliate WRBL on Saturday. "But I'm sorry for that family and I'm sorry. I'm just sorry," she said. "I got nothing else to say. I'm just sorry for the loss of that family." Police announced Saturday that they had arrested Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, in connection with the shooting death of Lauren Burk, 18, of Marietta, Georgia.  Watch the mother cry and apologize » Lockhart faces charges of capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery and capital murder during an attempted rape, police said. Also, Lockhart is facing robbery charges in the Phenix City, Alabama, area, said William Clanton of the Phenix City Police Department. Clanton did not know how many robberies Lockhart was suspected of committing. Lockhart is being held in the Russell County jail, but is expected to be moved to Lee County soon, where Auburn University is, Clanton said. Burk was found shot Tuesday night on North College Street, a few miles north of campus. She died later at a hospital. Minutes after police responded to a call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they received a report of a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Authorities believe gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, Auburn Assistant Police Chief Tommy Dawson said Friday. Police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was related to the case. Memorial services for Burk were held Saturday and Sunday at a Marietta church and synagogue. A campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. A memorial service was held Sunday in Athens, Georgia, for another slain university student Eve Carson, the Athens Banner Herald reported.	1
A Florida death-row inmate convicted of abducting and murdering 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in 2005 has died, prison officials said Wednesday. John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005. John Evander Couey, 51, died at 11:15 a.m. ET of natural causes, a Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman told CNN. He had been taken to a Jacksonville, Florida, hospital from Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida. Because of privacy laws, no further information could be released by the Department of Corrections. A source close to the case told CNN that Couey's death was not unexpected and he had been ill for some time. "I never dreamed it would happen like this," Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, told CNN. He said he never thought he would live long enough to see Couey put to death because of the lengthy appeals process. He said he was sad when he heard the news of Couey's death. "To me, death is sad," he said. "But her death, Jessie's death, has been redeemed ... I'm relieved. I'm glad it's over with." Couey was sentenced to die in August 2007 for abducting and raping Lunsford, then killing her by burying her alive. The girl was snatched from her bed in her family's Homosassa, Florida, home the evening of February 23, 2005, by Couey, a registered sex offender. Her body was found three weeks later, buried at the home of Couey's half-sister, who lived within sight of the Lunsford home. The girl's body was wrapped in plastic garbage bags, and her hands were bound with speaker wire. She was clutching a stuffed dolphin -- a toy won for her at a state fair by her father, and which Couey allowed her to bring with her when she was abducted. "I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday. "I don't feel sorry for him. I think God said, 'John Couey, it's time to go.' "	1
No candidate won enough votes to secure outright victory in the first round of the Afghan presidential poll, the election commission said Thursday. The election will proceed to a runoff on June 14 between former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, the two candidates who received the highest number of votes. In the first-round, in which around 7 millions Afghans voted on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. A candidate needs to receive more than 50% of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff. Preliminary results had been announced in late April, but had to be finalized after investigations into fraud complaints. The final results from the runoff will be announced on July 22, the election commission said. It's the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and is set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile, war-torn country. Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, and although he was once an ally of incumbent President Hamid Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years become an opponent. He challenged Karzai in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and also as finance minister in his Cabinet. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.	1
Here is an unofficial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court if President Barack Obama is reelected. This list was compiled from a number of legal and political sources, including government officials deeply involved in the selections of Justices Sonia Sotomayor (2009) and Elena Kagan (2010). The Obama administration, like those before, keeps an informal list of possible high court nominees to consider in the event of a sudden vacancy. But serious vetting only begins when such a vacancy occurs or is announced in advance by the retiring justice. Election raises stakes for possible high court vacancies Kamala Harris, California attorney general Born 1964. She was elected to her current job in 2010. She is part African-American, part Asian-American. Her father is a Jamaican-born Stanford University economics professor and her mother is an Indian-born (native Tamil) physician who works as a breast cancer specialist. Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and author of "Smart on Crime." Her political savvy, ethnic background, telegenic personality, law enforcement credentials, and early support of President Obama's 2008 candidacy make her a favorite for any high court vacancy in any second-term, and possibly for U.S. Attorney General. Complications: Harris may seek re-election in 2014 and then may run for governor the following year. Judge Paul Watford, 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, San Francisco Born 1967. His age and race (African-American) have made him a favorite among some liberal court watchers. Named to the appeals court in 2012. Clerked for conservative Judge Alex Kozinski on the 9th Circuit, and later for liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A former federal prosecutor and law firm partner. Supporters call him an ideological moderate, which may not sit well with progressives seeking a stronger left-leaning voice.

John Cossman's friends call him cancer's iron man. He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago. The cancer has spread to his right lung, ileum and pancreas – all the organs vital to his function as a pilot.Cossman, 57, is the first person in the U.S. to receive head and neck cancer radiation therapy and chemotherapy this way."This is for my life," he told CBS News. "This is not some minor issue, this is my whole life."His cancer began as a sore on his tongue, he said. It turned into a tumor that spread over the past few years, first to his lymph nodes and now to his neck.There's no cure for cancer and even a five percent cure rate is considered very good, but his radiation and chemotherapy have worked and he's continuing his treatment.He now has chemotherapy once a week and radiation to his neck every Sunday. He's lost about 30 pounds in the past three years and says he feels much better."I'm really looking forward to the future," said Cossman, who is retired from TWA and now works for UPS. "This therapy is going to give me something to look forward to."It's not the first time Cossman's cancer has been treated as a whole body treatment. He had a bone resection to combat the cancer and had a bone marrow transplant that helped him recover from the initial damage."The first time was tough. But I did it," he told CBS News.But now, he's just taking it day by day. He just finished a new round of radiation therapy last week.He said he's very close to finishing chemo, as well."I'm very excited for this final treatment," he said. "I'm not nervous, because I know this is going to be the last thing. It's going to be more than I expected."He's very close. Cossman is feeling better, but he remains hopeful that he can beat it.Cancer researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Dr. Robert A. Kasten, said the cancer is called head and neck cancer because it affects the head and neck, and not the usual throat and mouth cancer	0
Bishop Eddie Long has apologized to the Anti-Defamation League over an incident in which he was wrapped in a Torah scroll and crowned "king." As shown in a video that went viral, the televangelist was wrapped in a "Holocaust Torah" and crowned king during a recent ceremony at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, his suburban Atlanta congregation. "The ceremony was not my suggestion, nor was it my intent, to participate in any ritual that is offensive in any manner to the Jewish community, or any group. Furthermore, I sincerely denounce any action that depicts me as a King, for I am merely just a servant of the Lord," Long wrote in a letter dated Saturday. The letter was addressed to Bill Nigut, southeast regional director of the Anti-Defamation League -- a Jewish group that fights anti-Semitism. "While I believe that Rabbi Ralph Messer has good intentions during his message at New Birth, I understand that the ceremony he performed on Sunday, January 29th, caused harm to the Jewish community, for which I am deeply sorry," Long wrote. On Sunday, Nigut acknowledged the apology and said he was grateful for it. "I thought it was a very heartfelt, sincere, humble apology," he told CNN. "I was very gratified by Bishop Long apparently recognizing what our concern was." Nigut said he was deeply offended by the "fake ritual," and by how the Torah was handled during it. Video from the ceremony showed Messer wrapping Long in the Torah scroll, which he said was recovered during the Holocaust. He then directed four men to lift a seated Long in his chair and parade him before the New Birth congregation. "He is a king. God's blessed him. He's a humble man, but in him is kingship, royalty," Messer shouted. He said during the ceremony that the Torah was a "priceless" 312-year-old scroll that had been recovered from the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. He said he wanted to honor Long "on behalf of Jewish people, and the land of Israel." Rabbi Hillel Norry of Congregation Shearith Israel in Atlanta said last week the ceremony was "ridiculous." There's no Jewish coronation ceremony where someone is wrapped in a Torah and made a king, he said.	1
American Steve Stricker clinched a one-shot victory on the final day of the John Deere Classic to win the event in Illinois for the third year in a row. The 44-year-old finished with two birdies to card a 69 and move onto 22-under-par, narrowly defeating rookie Kyle Stanley. Canadian Matt McQuillan and world number 33 Zach Johnson were four strokes behind the 23-year-old Stanley, tied for third position on 17-under-par. Stricker, who has claimed 19 tournament wins since turning pro in 1990, is only the 10th post-war golfer to have triumphed at the same event three years running. Donald secures Scottish Open victory "It was an unbelievable week and an unbelievable finish," the new world number five told the PGA Tour's official web site. "I still can't believe I'm sitting here. Stricker holed a 25-foot putt on the 18th to complete his triumph, having recovered from losing a five-stroke lead during his final round to emerge victorious. "When I get into a situation where I have to make a putt, I feel like my nerves kind of go away and I focus extremely hard on trying to make that putt. And that's kind of like the little zone I got into on 17 and 18, I guess." Americans Charles Howell III and Chez Reavie shared fifth place on the final leaderboard, both carding 16-under for their 72 holes. Australia's Cameron Percy and Brendon de Jonge of Zimbabwe were tied for seventh on 15-under, with Briny Baird and Brian Gay one shot back in ninth. Meanwhile, So Yeon Ryu defeated her fellow South Korean Hee Kyung Seo in a three-hole playoff to clinch the women's U.S. Open. The 21-year-old secured her first major championship win after finishing the additional holes on two-under-par, three shots better than 25-year-old Seo.	1
Few female Chinese artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor Xiang Jing enjoys. Her work has been exhibited in America and throughout Europe. She was the subject of a recent joint survey show at  the Whitney Museum of American Art, and is represented by the New Museum in New York.Xiang was born in Shanghai in 1926 and grew up in the 1930s to 1940s, when she began carving wooden pieces while living with her grandfather, an artist who was one of the few in China to exhibit his work to the West. Her work first gained attention as she created a series of "hundreds and thousands and thousands of tiny pieces" [in a style similar to contemporary art] that appeared in various newspapers in Shanghai. As a result of that display, she was invited to participate in the 1936 Olympics when she placed third.In 1949 Xiang returned to her hometown, and began carving, which she continued to do through the 1970s when she made a study trip to Europe. She returned to Shanghai in the 1970s to attend art school, and continued to carve until the end of her life. Her works have been exhibited throughout the world, and were included in the "Chinese Masterpieces on Sale" exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, in the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2005) and the Brooklyn Museum of Art (2006).Xiang had a long and distinguished career. In addition to her numerous awards, she has been honored as one of the "most promising young artists" in China (1957), awarded the Third National Prize for Fine Arts, (1961), the National Prize for Fine Arts (1962), and the National Prize for Fine Arts (1962). She was awarded the First National Prize for Fine Arts in 1957, the Second National Prize for Fine Arts in 1962 and the Third National Prize for Fine Arts in 1965.In 2012, a group of artists and art lovers gathered at the Whitney Museum of American Art to commemorate the artist’s centenary. The Whitney hosted an exhibition, "The Art of Xiang Jing," which featured art created by her grandson, Xiang Jing, and other relatives as part of the exhibition.Xiang Jing also wrote two books. Her first book, "Masterpieces of the Art of Sculpture," was released in China in 2004. It is a collection of essays she wrote on her life and work and her family’s history.	0
Chris Pratt's career is about to soar out of this world â€” or, more accurately, out of this galaxy. EW has confirmed that the "Parks Â©" star is set to star in Sony's epic James Bond film Spectre, which will reunite him with Daniel Craig (from Casino Royale) and Javier Bardem (from InSpiral)."I am very excited that this is a 'James Bond' film that I will be playing, and I am just as thrilled to have Daniel Craig directing, and Javier Bardem reprising their roles," Pratt said in a statement. "Spectre is one of the most ambitious, exciting, and exciting James Bond films that I have ever seen, and I can't wait to get started!"This year proved to be a fruitful one for Pratt. After taking on the role of Ben Grimm in the new "Parks Â©" movie, Pratt will play the lead in Sony's new live-action Spider-Man movie, and he wrapped production on "The Walk," where he co-stars with Idris Elba.Sony will begin filming in July."Spectre" reunites James Bond to an all-new foe — one who has already been unmasked, and will be revealed to us in the film. The villain was once called Spectre, but now, at the behest of a mysterious figure named Daniel Craig, we no longer know who he is. That's right, Daniel Craig (who also directed "The Judge") was revealed last year as the villainous Agent 007 in "Spectre," and now the role is being reversed, with a new character — the new Spectre."Spectre" is set for release on Oct. 25, 2019, with Craig reprising his role as Bond in the film, and is directed by Cary Fukunaga, who also directed "The Florida Project." "Spectre" marks the second time that Sony releases a new James Bond film, following 2016's "Spectre.""The Bond franchise is one of the most successful franchises in cinema history, and James Bond is a hero for all of us. The prospect of taking Daniel Craig back into the role of James Bond was an absolute delight to me," said Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman. "I can't wait to see what his journey with this new character in Spectre will bring. This is a huge opportunity for	0
On Saturday he was the comedian-in-chief, cracking jokes with reporters and celebrities at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. On Sunday he oversaw one of the riskiest special forces operations since Desert One, Jimmy Carter's  trip to Cambodia to rescue American hostages there. But today, by virtue of his position of responsibility, he made it into prime time. He gave a speech at the National Archives and Records Administration, in which he talked about the importance of preserving documents that explain the rise and fall of nations. And he made a visit to the Library of Congress, where he pointed out some of the best public repositories of information, such as the National Archives and the National Book Foundation.You can see the whole thing here, for free.Let me repeat that. For free.That's because, in an important public service, the president of the United States has made the Library of Congress a special public archive that is not only accessible to everyone, but funded by taxes paid by every American, and thus is in effect open to the public for free.This is in contrast with, on the one hand, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which is run by the Department of Defense, and which also offers the public access for free (through its website at nradata.gov, and through a very limited number of offsite sites). This is in contrast to, on the other hand, the U.S. Navy's Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), which offers the public access for free only for its own archival collections, and then charges a nominal $1.25 each time you visit its "Digital Experience Gallery" in the Washington Navy Yard museum (see figure 1). All of this, and more that I'll describe further on, is at stake in the fight between NARA and NHHC over who gets to run the Library of Congress for public use.This fight is the opening chapter in a contest between rich and poorThis is the story of how the Library of Congress was created, first as a public library, then as a national archive, and of the fight between the government and private archive owners over who is responsible for preserving the records of the United States. And it is the story, as well, of the battle between the government's desire to open up the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to the public and the NHHC's desire to keep the	0
It's no shock that people love to hate Facebook. On Friday, for some, the emphasis shifted to hate as Facebook went public, turning its CEO into a billionaire and, as CNNMoney gracefully put it, Âgiving up on its users.ÂPeople are still angry over the Cambridge Analytica scandal , and many were calling for Zuckerberg to be sued, and for Facebook stock to be sold. But the real-world repercussions of his actions are more indirect and less shocking to me.He has lost credibility and respect. He has given up control and power. He gave up control and power. He gave up control and power. He gave up control and power.On Friday, I felt he gave up control and power. He gave up control and power. He gave up control and power. Because he has lost control over Facebook and Facebook's stock.He gave up control and power. Because he has relinquished control over the future of Facebook, which means Facebook has taken on a new, very uncertain and difficult future without him.This is a huge risk.This is a huge risk. The board of directors is made up of Facebook employees and investors. They're people who work directly for Facebook and it's in their job to run Facebook. They don't have the option of not following Facebook. That power is gone.The board of directors was made up of Facebook employees and investors.The board is made up of Facebook employees and investors. We've seen how bad it's gotten in those situations where the board doesn't have complete control over their company's direction.

The board is still made up of people who also work for Facebook.That's an enormous risk. That's an enormous risk. There's no reason for me to put my trust in some CEO who can't stand up to the board of directors or to the shareholders.What if there's a board meeting, someone says to Zuckerberg, "Look, Facebook's going to IPO within five years, and I think we should stop looking for revenue and instead focus on expanding the size of the company and how we get people to like it."What then?

Are technology companies ailing? Hewlett-Packard certainly is. The venerable behemoth announced it will implement a restructuring that includes eliminating 27,000 jobs. HP tried to bring itself around by replacing its CEO last year. That didn't quite do the trick, so now it's resorting to the good old-fashioned mass layoff. One suspects that HP is a little too venerable. It was the first "Stanford spinoff," fittingly reflected in the presence of Hewlett Hall and Packard Hall in the engineering corner of the Stanford campus. Yet HP hasn't stayed ahead of the innovation curve, failing for instance to adapt well to the tablet craze. This could be the end of an era. Consider two Stanford neighbors of Hewlett and Packard Halls -- Gates Hall and the Huang Center. Bill Gates' company may be losing the innovation war, too. It's getting pummeled by the tablets as well, and just this week Google's Chrome Web browser overtook Microsoft's Internet Explorer in popularity. By contrast, the Huang Center was funded by Jen-Hsun Huang, whose firm NVIDIA has been revolutionizing the supercomputer field. But won't those laid-off HP engineers be snapped up by the booming tech sector? Many will not. The tech job market is excellent for younger workers, but many of those who are laid off and over 35 will find the market less welcoming. They're perceived as too expensive. The HP layoff will consist disproportionately of older workers. Indeed, jettisoning the veterans is often the hidden agenda in mass layoffs. It's no coincidence that many of the U.S. core engineering openings at HP have titles like Recent Graduate, Intern and Post Doc, all aimed at the younger crowd. The difficulties of older techies have been investigated statistically in studies at American University and the National Research Council, but a very public human face was placed on this recently in an online town hall meeting with President Obama. The wife of electrical engineer Darin Wedel explained to the president that her husband has never found a permanent job after being laid off by the electronics giant Texas Instruments. Granted, family issues restricted him to the Dallas area, but if the hype regarding a seller's market for engineers were true, Wedel should have been able to find something in that region, which sadly has not been the case.	1
Days after North Korea's most famous defector revealed some of the details in his accounts about life in prison camps weren't true, the country's government fired back Tuesday. Shin Dong-hyuk's "admission of his lies goes to  the core of the national security issue regarding the existence and construction of military camps and prisons," it said.Shin, a retired North Korea defector who defected in 1992, said the camps were run by his country's government and that his account was "truthful."On Tuesday, he told "Face the Nation" he was not allowed to leave and that he was forced to tell lies because of government orders."I was not an eyewitness of the construction of the North Korean Gulag, and I had no access to it because they had told me I could not go beyond the camp boundary," Shin said.When asked if he was lying, Shin said, "No, I didn't lie at all."He said he told lies to get his son out and that the information he provided to U.S. officials was "strictly based on the intelligence of our people at that time."U.S. officials have been eager to learn the details of Shin's account. And on Tuesday, the State Department called his claims "a cause for concern.""The credibility of this defector's claims is problematic," a State Department spokesperson said. "In light of this, we are working our way through the details of his claims in an effort to determine if any of them are true and, if in fact there are any discrepancies, to resolve those. The United States is firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we are hopeful the North Korean regime will take serious action to begin the process of restoring peace on the Korean Peninsula."But the U.S. stance against Shin was unclear Tuesday. During an hour-long interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz, Secretary of State John Kerry said "there are a series of inconsistencies" in his account and expressed concern about the claims."His account is concerning" and he "doesn't speak for us," Kerry said. "So we are going to continue to look at all the details, but it is worth emphasizing that none of this happened."Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that the government of North Korea "threw a monkey wrench into" the	0
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is two for two. The Republican from Janesville, Wisconsin, has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in as little as 48 hours. A feat near impossible in these times of extreme partisanship. After laying low, Ryan swept into the budget battle crippling Washington with a plan to break the stalemate that has resulted in a government shutdown and no agreement so far on avoiding a possible U.S. debt default. With an op-ed and some persuading, he effectively moved demands by tea party aligned House Republicans on government funding and debt away from Obamacare. Op-ed doesn't mention Obamacare Ryan responds to critics That enabled House Republicans to propose an approach on Friday on the fiscal impasse that still hasn't met President Barack Obama's chief requirements, but hasn't scotched negotiations, either. Obama, Boehner agree all sides should keep talking The Ryan Express chugged into the White House on Thursday with other House Republican leaders where he again waited for his opportunity to make an impact. In that meeting, progress seemed elusive as the two sides talked past each other. Then, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate stepped in. And the tone of the meeting changed. Key moment in White House meeting Ryan conceded his side wouldn't get all it wanted while Obama asked how he could make something happen. Borger: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy Republicans left the executive mansion expressing optimism, motivated to get to work. The White House admitted progress. But can Ryan push a deal over the finish line? He might be the person in the Republican Party to do it. Ryan leaves drama to others In new book, Paul Ryan asks 'where do we go from here?' The Republican's chief negotiator, House Speaker John Boehner, has been unable -- or unwilling -- to reach a deal with the President amid the shutdown. Boehner and Obama have a fractured history of bitter negotiations. Both said afterward they felt burned by the other. Though they did talk by phone on Friday and agreed talks should go on. Ryan and Obama, on the other hand, have a completely different relationship. They were the fiercest of competitors during the presidential election. Even after, they remain political foes. "Now that the president is implementing his agenda, we'll see that the benefits are far less than advertised," Ryan said at the National Review Institute in January, just days after Obama was inaugurated for the second time.	1
A strong earthquake shook central Japan on Saturday night, injuring dozens of people and destroying homes in a city some 740 kilometers (470 miles) south of Tokyo.The powerful 5.8-magnitude temblor struck at approximately 9:30 p.m., according to the Meteorological Agency, the Japan Meteorological Agency, a government body. At least 16 homes were destroyed, four other houses had collapsed, and 21 others were damaged, the agency said.Local media reports said about 120 houses were damaged in the city of Fukushima, some 330 kilometers (200 miles) southwest of Tokyo.The U.S. Geological Survey said that the earthquake was very shallow and centered on the northern tip of the Tohoku prefecture in northeastern Japan.Tohoku is prone to earthquakes and the Tohoku-Oki fault line also runs through the city, the agency said.The agency said the powerful temblors come in pairs and can last up to an hour. It said the quake was felt in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukui and Toyama prefectures in central Honshu.The agency said the earthquake struck at a depth of about 21 kilometers (13 miles).Tsunami warningThe Meteorological Agency said there was a slight possibility of a tsunami triggered by the quake.The agency warned of possible tsunami waves of up to 30 meters (100 feet) and that there was a 15-kilometer (9-mile) radius of maximum height in the Pacific Ocean.In Japan, Tsunami warnings for the Tokyo area were canceled, but a tsunami warning was issued for coastal communities along the northeast of Japan.The U.S. Geological Survey said there was a moderate likelihood that a tsunami would hit the Tokyo area, but gave no other estimates of the size or frequency of waves.The agency said its tsunami warning for the northeastern Pacific was canceled on Friday.Many Pacific islands rely heavily on the ocean for commerce, especially with U.S. trade partners like China.Japan is believed to have one of the world's longest coastlines, and because of its location on the Pacific seaboard, it is prone to frequent earthquakes and tsunamis.SatellitesThe U.S. Geological Survey said it is monitoring the temblor for three days to determine	0
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic "has the faintest idea" what his organization does after the former world No. 1 said he'd lost faith in the system. The Serbian labeled compatriot Viktor Troicki's 12-month ban from tennis for missing a drugs test a "total injustice" and said he was now nervous to give any sort of sample. But Fahey dismissed the six-time grand slam winner's comments as unhelpful and said it was up to the sport to do more to fight against doping. "I don't think Novak Djokovic has the faintest idea what we do and if he wants to understand what we do I'm more than happy to pick up the phone and talk to him, if he wants to talk to me," he told CNN. "If he wishes to then make a comment I might listen to him but for the moment I don't think that was an informed statement." WADA's role in the fight against doping in sport has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of athletes failed tests in Kenya and Jamaica. And as well as Troicki, Croatian tennis star Marin Cilic also served a ban for doping offenses after taking a prohibited substance contained in supplements bought from a chemist. Those cases have provoked disagreement within the game as to the best course of action, with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray calling the pair's actions "unprofessional." Roger Federer, winner of 17 grand slams, said more testing needed to be done within the sport and also said players should give a sample when requested. But when asked if he knew how widespread doping in tennis was, Fahey replied: "No I don't and nor do I think tennis knows how widespread it is. "What I do know is they have a program and a commitment has been given. Can they do more? Every sport can do more. "And when you get criticism from some of the champion tennis players about the number of times they've been tested then I hope tennis takes notice of it. I know they have and I believe that they'll address it." Fahey also said the fall from grace of cyclist Lance Armstrong had been the best anti-doping message since he became WADA president in 2007.	1
When American pop artist Andy Warhol visited Beijing in 1982 and was told there wasn't a McDonald's, he replied: "Oh, but they will." Twenty-six years after his death, Warhol, whose much-lauded prescience extended across  the world, has returned a second time, and this time he has seen a McDonald's. His trip was arranged by a group of China-based American artists, in conjunction with the McDonald's Corporation. It was first reported by the New York Times.The trip is significant because McDonald's is on the precipice of global domination. Even though it has long struggled to attract Chinese customers, the company is now being asked to move into the Chinese market. In the past, it has resisted, citing political sensitivity. Now, though, it's facing a potentially decisive battle.McDonald's doesn't have a brand in China in any meaningful sense. It was originally named the Hong Kong McDonald's but changed the name after the Chinese Revolution, fearing that it would confuse Chinese readers, who might be unable to tell the difference between a McDonald's with a hamburger and a McDonald's with a hamburger and a cup of coffee. It now has some 20,000 outlets worldwide and a much-publicized international "chain of value," with hundreds of thousands of outlets in various countries. But it's not one of the biggest corporations, and its market share there is tiny, compared with that of rivals such as Burger King, Wendy's, KFC, and Domino's.Its Chinese strategy, moreover, is to become a brand in the Chinese language, with its own local commercials and promotional activities. It will take its time to reach the consumers, in part, because a McDonald's is unlikely to be so large in China as to become the first McDonald's in the country.To be sure, McDonald's isn't the only restaurant with an international presence in China. But it is the only one with a significant presence, a factor that has always impressed Andy Warhol, and will always be among the company's great strengths: its culture and the importance of personal touch in the chain's food and service.Warhol, born in 1929, grew up in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.

Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River. What the 27-year-old from Fenwick, Ontario, didn't expect was to find himself hurtling over a 20-foot waterfall that had never been documented -- and then go on to discover six more waterfalls after fixing his canoe. The nearly 100-kilometer long Again River is a tributary of Quebec's Harricanaw River, part of Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands. It's one of the largest roadless areas on earth outside Antarctica, says Shoalts, containing rivers so remote that even today there are a few that have escaped accurate mapping -- including the Again. "The expedition was five years in the making," he says. "Extensive research went into it, looking through explorers' records, Geological Survey notes, speaking directly with aboriginal elders." But his research didn't offer any hints as to the dangers that lay ahead. Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls. "The plan was to explore the river, record information about flora and fauna, rapids and the geography in general," he says. "I knew there would be lots of whitewater rapids, but no one knew that waterfalls existed on the river." 'Yikes, this is going to be bad!' With the support of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, Shoalts conducted two reconnaissance expeditions to the area (one in 2008 and another in 2009), exploring the wilderness around the Again River. But he wasn't able to canoe the Again, as just getting to the river's isolated headwaters is a challenge that involves a few days of bushwhacking and creek-hopping. "In August 2012, I went back, this time alone, determined to canoe the river no matter what," he says. "The seven waterfalls were so unexpected and special." The first waterfall Shoalts found -- before it was too late to go around it -- was 20-feet high. Of the six he went on to discover, the highest was 40-feet high. "My first thought when I realized I was being swept over a waterfall was, 'Wow! What an amazing discovery! The Geographical Society will be thrilled!" he recalls.	1
Gunmen on motorcycles fired Friday on a campaign office for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wounding two adults and a child, according to a report by Iran's state-run news agency. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was not at the office at the time and has been traveling across the country, according to the report.A local prosecutor was quoted by IRNA as saying that both men being hospitalised with injuries are in their 20s.The attack, which occurred in North Tehran, was claimed by Tehran's Basij militia, who had attacked several senior Ahmadinejad supporters in the past."The Basij has a lot of members and they have carried out a lot of operations against those (Ahmadinejad supporters) who have insulted the president," Gholamali Rashidi, a spokesman for Basij, told the agency.Ahmadinejad has a large base of support among Iran's poor, and his visit to the country this week, just after Iran has lifted its ban on fuel exports to Japan, was seen as a significant attempt to woo the lower classes and to raise the profile of his presidency.But with Iran's election campaign in full swing, he may have been perceived as courting the most radical elements of his supporters.The Basij, which has clashed with the government in the past, said its leaders were not planning a renewed campaign against Ahmadinejad."We have a number of Basij brigades on our side," Rashidi said. "What is happening in the capital is our internal issue and the result of the fight we are fighting. We have our own work."In a sign of the mounting tension in Iran, Iran's foreign ministry issued a statement on Friday saying it was "truly shocking" that "those whose slogans have been raised in support of violence should be receiving the political support of the Iranian nation".The statement said that "Iran has been living through serious internal and external challenges, but these challenges can only be overcome by a strong and united Iranian nation, and so we can only expect greater unity of the Iranian nation in the forthcoming presidential elections".Iran's president has said he wants to raise the banner of "democracy" over his country during his time in office.His visit, the first for the new president of the Islamic republic, was seen as a significant attempt to woo the lower classes and to raise the	0
I have always been a fiercely independent woman. I learned from my grandmother -- the breadwinner in her marriage -- that there was nothing that a woman couldn't do as well as a man. I started working when I was 16 years old and, by all accounts, I had achieved a fairly high degree of success as a young journalist in my early 20s. A die-hard feminist, my desire for self-sufficiency didn't stem from a movement: It was personal. A child of divorced parents who always fought about money-related issues, and with my grandmother's words etched in my mind, I told myself at a young age that I would never rely on a man or anyone to take care of me. I became so defiant about being able to do things on my own that I would rarely even let people buy me meals. That still holds true today. Then, I met "Tom," who was much older and more successful than me. We started dating in my early 30s at a time when my career had me traveling all over the world to report stories. I was neither looking for a relationship nor cared to be in one. A lot of my friends, however, were beginning to settle down and I started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same. That's not to say I wasn't happy with where I was: I loved my work and I loved the woman I had become. Tom was a nice man who seemed to take a liking to me quite quickly. Like many men of similar ilk, Tom could be aggressive about acquiring things he wanted. Before I knew it, I was being sucked into his vortex. One week we'd be cruising the Mediterranean in a massive full-service yacht, the next we'd be on a shopping excursion in Rome. It all happened so fast and I was being exposed to a part of the world that -- despite being well-traveled -- I had never experienced. It started to become glaringly apparent that I was being seduced by a lifestyle. I was becoming a sugar baby. Or at least, that's how I felt. College 'sugar babies' date for cash We all know what sugar daddies are: Wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- "sugar babies" -- to date, even marry and take care of.	1
Everywhere you look there are two-wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board. They're the backbone of public transport in Uganda and the fastest way to get around the  country. And the problem, from a safety point of view, is they're not wearing seatbelts. An alarming number of deaths in recent years have been blamed on the high number of drivers who recklessly drive without their seat belts.The story of a Ugandan whose life changed after falling off his bike into the road is perhaps the type of story that could start a media frenzy in Uganda. Unfortunately not many drivers are so lucky to be found.In the UK, a man who was knocked off his bike by a car while he practised for a hill climb died as a result of his injuries. He was 25 years old and from the West Midlands in England. The accident was recorded on video and his death was captured on a number of live television and newspaper broadcasts across the UK. The accident made national headlines and his story was one of the most prominent in the UK for many years.The circumstances of his death even received attention on the BBC. The presenter of the programme said, “He made a huge effort to learn as much as he could about what he needed to do before the event in order to be able to do it in safety. He put himself into some great danger but he didn’t do it alone. He was well trained in first aid, in what to do when there is an accident, but if you don’t know how to do something then you just have to make sure you’re safe before you do it anyway”.Uganda is a country where few people, if any, live in a car. But according to the National Transport Authority (NTA) the bus sector is the most popular and it's estimated that there are 20% more passengers on buses in Uganda than there are in the UK. And the problem is that people choose to take the bus over the more luxurious and more frequent but also more dangerous private car.In addition to the high number of deaths due to bad drivers, the NTA has also reported that an estimated 50% of passengers on Uganda's roads are at the very least under the age of 16. And according to the NTA, there is an urgent need for better, more safety-proof and more convenient public transport for people to	0
Oscar Pistorius was not mentally incapacitated when he shot his girlfriend to death, a psychiatric assessment of the athlete has found. The results of the assessment were revealed in court Monday when the Olympic sprinter's trial resumed after a monthlong break for the evaluation. According to the findings by an independent panel of doctors, Pistorius did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the "time of the commission of the offense that would have rendered him criminally not responsible of the offenses charged." The report added that "Mr. Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act." Had the doctors deemed Pistorius mentally incapacitated during the shooting, the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering his girlfriend, 29-year-old model and law school graduate Reeva Steenkamp, in his home in February 2013. Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through a closed door, killing her, but has told the court in Pretoria, South Africa, that he mistook her for an intruder. He has pleaded not guilty. The state says Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her. On May 20, trial Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered Pistorius to report for a psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible for his actions. The prosecution and defense said they accepted the report's findings. The defense has resumed its case. Psychiatrist's testimony Pistorius' psychiatric testing last month was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant, stemming partly from the amputation his lower legs. The disorder meant Pistorius had "excessive" concerns about security and felt threatened even when, objectively, he was not, Dr. Merryll Vorster testified on May 12. After Vorster's testimony, prosecutor Gerrie Nel filed a motion asking the judge to require psychiatric tests, arguing that if there was any chance the defendant's mental health was an issue, the court must "err on the side of caution." Nel's extremely unusual move was essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or "capacity" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps said Nel appeared to be placing a high-stakes bet that experts would disagree with Vorster's evidence.	1
Kaci Hickox, a nurse who worked with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey for three days even though she tested negative for Ebola and is asymptomatic. After much protest, she was finally released on Monday. In her opinion, her "basic human rights have been violated." She appeared on CNN and criticized politicians' reactions to Ebola and the lack of forethought and plan. This newest quarantine has us wondering again how far the government can restrain individuals for the common good. No doubt, being physically confined by the government feels like a fundamental violation. But it's rarely a legal violation. For over a hundred years, the Supreme Court and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination. The seminal case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, recognized "manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good." So how far does this power to regulate for the public health go? Consider the infamous 1927 case of Buck v. Bell -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state's involuntary sterilization of "feebleminded" persons in state institutions. The court broadened state power drastically to allow forcing unwanted surgery on a female for the express purpose of neutering her. Perhaps most shocking to modern sensibilities was the court's use of the Jacobson logic of contagious diseases. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in a judicial opinion that the "principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes" to avoid further generations of "imbeciles." Yes. The Supreme Court actually said that. Since then, the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine, confinement or sequestration. Along with many other cases echoing similar sentiments, little doubt remains about the matter. State governments have historically enjoyed nearly unfettered power to restrain our liberty in the name of public health. These cases were decided in times when crowded urban conditions, less-advanced medicine, and lack of public education required drastic measures to avoid the scourge of disease infection. But times have changed, and the collective views of citizens and governments today bear little resemblance to those of centuries past.	1
The U.S. Navy arrested nine more suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia Thursday -- the second capture in two days -- after receiving a distress call from an Indian-flagged commercial ship. The capture of the Indian ship, Mahesh, comes less than a month after a U.S., Navy warship rescued a crew of pirates off the coast of Somalia, ending the piracy crisis plaguing the region. But the Mahesh's capture was not totally unexpected. An earlier attempt by pirates seeking the ransom of a Panamanian freighter has also been thwarted.A U.S. spokesman for the operation said only that the Mahesh is believed to be carrying gold and "contains valuables such as medicines and foodstuffs." It is unclear what the Mahesh was doing in Somalia. Indian authorities did not respond to requests for comment. After it made the distress call reporting an attack on its radio frequency, the Mahesh set off on a rescue mission for the Mahesh after getting help from Indian Navy ships. The Mahesh later reported that it had been attacked, and it fired anti-aircraft guns at the pirates.A U.S. Navy fighter pilot says he saw a plane, believed to be from the Mahesh, crash into the Indian ship and then sink about 100 meters off the port side. The pilot told the Associated Press, "It was a surprise to me because I was under orders to not do rescues."The Mahesh has a crew of about 150, and has been sailing for the Indian-based Vardhana Shipping company. It is bound for the West African coast in West Africa, and officials didn't say when the crew may be returning home.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Some U.S. officials this year are expected to get smartphones capable of handling classified government documents over cellular networks, according to people involved in the project. The phones will run a modified version of Google's Android software, which is being developed as part of an initiative that spans multiple federal agencies and government contractors, these people said. The smartphones are first being deployed to U.S. soldiers, people familiar with the project said. Later, federal agencies are expected to get phones for sending and receiving government cables while away from their offices, sources said. Eventually, local governments and corporations could give workers phones with similar software. The Army has been testing touchscreen devices at U.S. bases for nearly two years, said Michael McCarthy, a director for the Army's Brigade Modernization Command, in a phone interview. About 40 phones were sent to fighters overseas a year ago, and the Army plans to ship 50 more phones and 75 tablets to soldiers abroad in March, he said. "We've had kind of an accelerated approval process," McCarthy said. "This is a hugely significant event." Currently, the United States doesn't allow government workers or soldiers to use smartphones for sending classified messages because the devices have not met security certifications. Officials have said they worry that hackers or rogue apps could tap into the commercial version of Android and spill state secrets to foreign governments or to the Web through a publisher such as WikiLeaks. As many as 5 million Android users may have had their phones compromised by a recent virus outbreak rooted in apps found on Google's market, said security software maker Symantec. But with a secure smartphone, a soldier could see fellow infantry on a digital map, or an official could send an important dispatch from Washington's Metro subway without fear of security breaches. Developers in the government program have completed a version that has been authorized for storing classified documents but not transmitting them over a cell network, said two people contributing to the initiative. Smartphones cleared for top-secret dispatches -- high-level classified information that would compromise national security if intercepted -- are expected to be ready in the next few months, they said. Rather than building special handsets hardwired with secure components, the government plans to install its software on commercially available phones, the people familiar with the project said. This approach is far less expensive and allows the government to stay up to date with the latest phones on the market, they said. Android vs. Apple	1
Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with "preventing the lawful and decent burial" of his wife, Eva, UK media said. Her body was discovered in an advanced urn this week on a Danish island. The 46-year-old was arrested in Germany, following the discovery of the urn and has been charged with "incitement of racial hatred" under article 295 of the criminal code.Rausing, who is an investor in pharmaceutical companies at the center of the Salk vaccine controversy, made a brief appearance at the Copenhagen district court, where his wife's body was being viewed. He was remanded in custody until October 7.Eva Rausing's urn was discovered in a cabin in the Danish island of Langeland on Tuesday and, upon hearing her identity, the cabin's owners said it was "obviously a crime scene".It is reported that the urn was set up in the cabin at their request. The urn was found in an advanced urn and contained what were described as "items of value".Eva Rausing is said to have "suffered serious psychological distress" prior to her death after being diagnosed with cancer.The case has taken on an added dimension as it quickly became known that a close relative of Eva Rausing, who has since been arrested on charges of "incitement to racial hatred", was at the centre of the affair.Peter Rausing, the son of Hans Kristian Rausing, who was arrested in Germany after Eva's death, has been in custody since Wednesday. He was charged with "incitement of racial hatred" under article 295.Eva Rausing's mother, Viborg woman Jette Marie Løvborg, was identified by the media as the person seen holding a mobile phone recording of the urn's discovery after returning from a trip to the island of Langeland on Tuesday.She told newspapers the phone recording was a "horrible mistake". Her son was also being held for questioning, she said: "It is all nonsense. He is innocent."The Løvborg family are reported to have been close friends with Eva Rausing, having been "very close to her during the time she lived with us, as her children were also very close to her", the media reported.Eva Rausing,	0

A Chinese man captured by federal agents in 2011 has pleaded guilty in a federal court for pirating copyrighted software worth more than $100 million, Â a charge that could send other Chinese citizens to jail, according to one of the victimsâ??s lawyers.On Thursday, the judge sentenced Lei Feng, a graduate of a prestigious Chinese university, to two years in prison and ordered him to pay $10,000 in restitution to the complainant and the complainantâ??s attorneys.â??When this case goes to trial, I believe it will be clear that Chinaâ??s current copyright laws, which have been abused by a small group of rogue individuals, have no place in our society. If these laws are left unchanged, as I strongly believe, there will be people who simply will not abide by them,â? said attorney J. Christopher Stevens.Lei Feng was arrested by the FBI on April 8, 2011, and charged with computer crime under two laws: 18 USC 1030Â in connection with computer crime, and 50 USC 1032 in connection with violating copyright laws, the U.S. Attorneyâ??s office said in a statement.In a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, filed on Dec. 18, Lei Feng pleaded guilty to the computer crime charges and agreed to pay $10,000 in restitution to the complainant. In addition, he admitted that between April 1, 2006 and April 1, 2007, he possessed and distributed computer software to Chinese computer users that was illegal to distribute and that included a copyright notice for the software that was created by another company, and the complainant was not authorized to receive that software, the plea agreement states.The copyright notice that Lei Feng posted on May 11, 2007, included the name of the software company that had created the software, but included the word â??freeâ? in Chinese, as well as Chinese symbols, the plea agreement states.In the computer crime count, Lei Feng admitted that in 2005 and 2006, he used the Chinese version of the software that contained unauthorized copyrighted software, according to the plea agreement.Court papers show that between July 28 and Aug. 26, 2005, Lei Feng registered at the U.S. Copyright Office in Washington with the Copyright Office of Macau and the Copyright Office of Hong Kong (the two copyright offices that register works in a foreign country, a court filing	0
It is the role that every fan of the beautiful game counts on but which few people envy. The much-maligned position of the football referee is a job that attracts criticism, controversy and castigation on an almost weekly basis with little glory in return. Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho is the latest to add his voice to the deafening boom of dissent so often aimed at various men in black around the world. Despite a 5-1 victory for his side against Murcia in Spain's Cop del Rey, the Portuguese boss let rip at the referee Paradas Romero's record of showing more then six yellow cards per match. Romero added to this with a red card for Mourinho himself, after the 47-year-old told the official to "Go f*** himself" during the game, according to the ref. The incident follows similar controversy in Britain where Manchester United's game against English title rivals Tottenham last month ended in farce when Mark Clattenburg allowed Portugal winger Nani to score despite his clear handball in the build-up. Should referees be relegated too? Clattenburg's clanger came hot on the heals of referee Dougie McDonald's blooper in Scotland where he awarded a penalty to Celtic against rivals Dundee United, before overturning his own decision before the kick was taken. In honor of all of the above, Fanzone takes a look at the best moments of on-pitch gaffes from soccer's finest: Brazilian ball boy scores equalizing goal Silvia Regina de Oliveira was the first woman to ever referee a match in the Brazilian National Championship, and went on to handle games at the 2004 Olympics. But her career went into decline two years later when she inexplicably awarded Santacruzense a late equalizer against Atletico Sorocaba in a Paulista Football Federation Cup clash. One of the home team's players had fired a shot into the outside of the net, and the waiting ball boy took the chance to cheekily evade the visiting goalkeeper and tap a shot over the goal-line. De Oliveira did not see the incident, but noticed the ball was in the net, so consulted with her linesman and awarded a goal -- sparking scenes of mayhem as the Atletico players protested. Despite the video evidence, the result of the match was allowed to stand. "I should have trusted my own vision," De Oliveira later admitted. Three yellow cards equals one red	1
An FBI analyst and former vice presidential aide was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison for espionage after he admitted supplying classified documents to Philippine nationals in an effort to overthrow that country's government, federal prosecutors said. Leandro Aragoncillo, 48, a former U.S. Marine and Philippine native who worked as a military aide to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Dick Cheney before joining the FBI as a civilian employee, pleaded guilty to four charges of espionage in May 2006. The plea deal spared Aragoncillo from facing the death penalty, prosecutors said. In a sentencing hearing Wednesday morning, U.S. District Judge William H. Walls sentenced Aragoncillo to 10 years in prison for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. In addition, he fined Aragoncillo $40,000. Aragoncillo could have been sentenced to up to 20 years for participation in a conspiracy to transmit national defense information, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie, in a news release issued Wednesday, accused Aragoncillo of "betraying his Marine uniform, his adopted country and the trust bestowed on him as an FBI analyst." Michael Ray Aquino, a co-conspirator, was sentenced by Walls on Tuesday to six years in prison. Aquino, 41, is a former Philippine national police officer who pleaded guilty in July 2006 to taking classified documents, obtained from Aragoncillo, and passing them on to Philippine officials plotting to overthrow Arroyo. Aragoncillo, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested along with Aquino on September 10, 2005. Mark Berman, an attorney for Aquino, said that his client admits receiving documents from Aragoncillo, but maintains that he did not know the information was classified. Prosecutors say that Filipino recipients of the classified documents included former President Joseph Estrada, who was ousted six years ago; Sen. Panfilo Lacson, an opposition politician; and former House Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella. "I never intended to cause harm or injury to the United States," Aragoncillo told the judge. Aquino's attorney said his client was "relieved" that the court rejected the government's recommended sentence of 10 years in favor of a lighter penalty. Attorneys for Aragoncillo refused to comment.

He got his first big break at art school, when an employee from Wilkinson Sword saw his graduation show and commissioned him to design some disposable razors. Today, Dick Powell is one of the world's leading figures in design. As one half of British design agency Seymourpowell, he is responsible for such milestone products as the pocket mobile phone and cordless kettle and has designed for major institutions including Unilever, Panasonic and NestlÃ©. He has twice been appointed President of the UK's Design and Art Direction (D&AD) board, who honored his outstanding contribution to creativity with their President's Award. Recently, somewhere in between working on a new concept for the Virgin Galactic spacecraft and running a business, Powell has found time to take on a new role -- that of the mentor. Not a stranger to TV after his series "Better by Design" with company co-founder Richard Seymour, Powell appears on screen for CNN's Blueprint to offer guidance to a group of ambitious students who have created electricity conducting paint. We caught the design kingpin for an exclusive Q&A. CNN: What are the three most important principles of good product design? Dick Powell: That's easy. Design is about making things better -- that means better for people, better for business and better for the world. CNN: Which product from the last decade is the best example of a meeting between form and function? DP: Apple's iPhone. It's what we call a meta-product, so it's a combination of hardware, software and service. CNN: What's the best way for an amateur designer to turn a great idea into a reality? DP: Never give up. That would be the first piece of advice. Getting a new product to market is an amazingly difficult thing to do. It's not about the design. The design is just one part of it. You need the finance to fund it. The most important thing, which most people get wrong, is that they think they have a good idea when in fact it's probably not a good idea. It's a great idea to them but they need to think very hard about their potential market and be convinced that it is going to have a volume acceptance, because you can't get products to market without high numbers. Also, people often forget about distribution -- it is fine to have a great product but you've got to get it in front of people. CNN: How does the environment you work in affect creativity?	1
Leaders from Britain and Iran met Wednesday for the first time in 35 years, a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when Tehran is trying to shed Western-led sanctions over its nuclear program and Western nations are trying to Â understand and engage with Tehran, said a European diplomat.While Washington and Tehran have little to talk about for now, the gathering is viewed as a key early step in a process to try to forge a strategic dialogue between them."If Tehran decides that they have had enough dialogue now, they're going to have more," said the European diplomat. "We are trying to get them on the same page but they've got a lot of things on their plate and that's hard. We need a bit of time."But Tehran and Britain have so far not spoken in person since 1979, when Britain helped Iran overthrow the brutal Shah and restore the independence of the country from its Western sponsors.While there is little trust between Britain and Iran, the meeting of the leaders of the two countries, the first since 1977, also serves to underscore Tehran's growing relationship with Britain and growing ties with its European allies, which it can only get in return for Western concessions to Tehran on issues and concerns that Tehran says are critical to its regional interests.European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Britain is "clearly" committed to its EU partners to support a long-lasting, transparent dialogue and a "new, more constructive engagement between Iran, the UK and our American colleagues."In a statement, Ashton called the meeting a "welcome step, but more is needed."British Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted that the talks were "a step in the right direction for building up our relations" but he said, "There are many more to go."In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry called the meeting of the leaders "a crucial step.""It's something the Iranians haven't done for 35 years and, as we all know, they are determined to break that stalemate," Kerry said at a news conference.The meeting was being held in the Iranian capital of Tehran, an important event for the Iranian leadership but which has drawn scant attention internationally.Many analysts and diplomats have argued that the visit was a way to signal Iran's willingness to engage with the West.Kerry said the meeting between Rouhani and Prime Minister David Cameron would	0
The protests that have spread through parts of the Arab world led to dramatic change in another country Tuesday, as Jordan's king dismissed his government. King Abdullah II made the decision following protests in recent weeks in which several government ministers have resigned in protest at the government's handling of an economic crisis.The protests in Jordan, known in Arabic as the Cedar Revolution, have been triggered by allegations that the government's economic reforms made large loans available to some of the country's richest men and women who have failed to repay them.Jordan's king, King Abdullah II, held his first press conference since the protests began on Monday, announcing that the government would be dissolved if a new election did not take place within 15 days."The king has made a statement announcing that he has dissolved the Jordanian government," said a government spokesman.The first cabinet ministers to resign were Finance Minister Aziz Abu Al Darda and Agriculture Minister Mohammed al-Lahrabi.The minister of information, Abdullah Hammad, announced on Monday that all the ministers would resign unless a resolution of the crisis was reached.The second cabinet ministers to resign, the education and culture minister Aziz Abu Al Darda, the trade minister Yussef Ghazawi and the transportation and energy minister Muhammad Ali al-Naggar were also sacked by Abdullah II.The government spokesman said the king was not obliged to give reasons for dismissing ministers.Abdullah II was re-elected in 1993 and his only daughter, Princess Hayat, was married to Jordan's monarch in a lavish wedding ceremony in June.A constitutional monarchy in Jordan had existed since King Hussein's death in January 1999. The current king is 42-year-old Abdullah II, who in 1994 became the first Jordanian monarch not to have been born in the country.A recent survey showed that Jordan's king has a low approval rating of 27 per cent. Many Jordanians still prefer their king to his son, Crown Prince Hussein, whom Abdullah II also succeeded as king.The protesters said they were angered by the low salaries offered by the government and the fact that some of the richest people in the country had not paid back the loans in full.The protests quickly spread to other Arab countries and more than 300 people were arrested in Jordan on Monday and Tuesday as authorities tried to contain them.	0
Distribution of food, seed and medical relief intended for drought victims in Somalia has been suspended, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced Thursday. The aid intended for up to 1.1 million people has been held up because local authorities blocked distribution of ICRC food and seed relief in the Middle Shabelle and Galgaduud regions in central and southern Somalia, according to a statement by the organization. "We are actively seeking the cooperation of the local authorities to restore conditions that will allow the resumption of the suspended activities as soon as possible," said Patrick Vial, the head of the ICRC delegation for Somalia. According to the ICRC statement, the organization has distributed food relief to more than 1 million people and agricultural support to more than 100,000 farmers. In addition, the ICRC has helped treat more than 170,000 severely malnourished children and made health care more available in remote areas, the statement said. Last month, two attacks on aid workers in Somalia killed five people -- two from Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, and three from the U.N. World Food Programme. The African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, the capital, where Islamic militants had been especially active in their battle against that government. AMISOM forces reported in late December they had successfully pushed the Al-Shabaab movement out of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab is linked to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States.	1

A grenade exploded Saturday during a routine vehicle inspection near a base in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul, a spokesman for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force said. The explosion occurred at about 7 p.m. local time near Camp Eggers, Maj. Bryan Woods said. The were no reports of casualties. But the blast forced the temporary lockdown of the fortified base, which sits a short distance from the presidential palace. "The base is secured at this time and has resumed operations," Woods said. In eastern Afghanistan, a suicide bomb attack killed at least one ISAF service member, according to officials. ISAF did not release the service member's nationality or details about the attack.	1
David Moyes has been appointed as the new manager of Manchester United after agreeing a six-year deal. The 50-year-old, who will replace Alex Ferguson on July 1, revealed his desire to leave current club Everton earlier Thursday. Moyes, who has been in charge at Goodison Park since 2002, will take charge of the club's final two Premier League games of the season before making the move to Old Trafford. "It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website. "I am delighted that Sir Alex saw fit to recommend me for the job. I have great respect for everything he has done and for the football club. "I know how hard it will be to follow the best manager ever, but the opportunity to manage Manchester United isn't something that comes around very often and I'm really looking forward to taking up the post next season. "I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players. "Between now and the end of the season, I will do everything in my power to make sure we finish as high as possible in the table. "Everton's fantastic fans have played a big part in making my years at Goodison so enjoyable and I thank them wholeheartedly for the support they have given me and the players. Everton will be close to me for the rest of my life." Moyes has been publicly endorsed by Ferguson, who says his fellow Scot is the perfect man to take over at the helm. "When we discussed the candidates that we felt had the right attributes we unanimously agreed on David Moyes," Ferguson told the club's official website. "David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic. I've admired his work for a long time and approached him as far back as 1998 to discuss the position of Assistant Manager here. "He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton. "There is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this Club." Delighted The appointment has been met with approval by leading players with defender Rio Ferdinand claiming the squad was "delighted." He told the club's televisions station: "I think it was important that the club made a decision quickly and it all got sorted out. I think the club have acted impeccably in that sense.	1
August 20, 2010 Swedish prosecutors issue an arrest warrant for Julian Assange amid allegations of rape and molestation from two female Wikileaks volunteers earlier that month. The next day, the prosecutor's office announces it is  investigating whether Assange "violated the rights of two victims of sexual abuse". Five days later, WikiLeaks releases the first of its trove of leaked diplomatic cables. Over the next few months, as Assange himself repeatedly refuses to accept his extradition to Sweden for the alleged offenses, the U.S. government threatens to seize all of the organization's archives. Wikileaks' founder is eventually charged with the computer crime of violating the Espionage Act in the United States, and then indicted for conspiracy to commit computer crimes by the Feds—charges that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison in the United States.Assange is initially able to escape to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and stay safe until he reaches his country's diplomatic residency in Stockholm. There, he remains safe from the legal threats directed towards him by the U.S. government. WikiLeaks then becomes a journalistic outlet, and it begins publishing the diplomatic cables in real time.Julian Assange's legal problems become a political issue for the country he grew up in. In the months following Assange's release to the Ecuadorian embassy in London in April 2010, it is made apparent that his case is a matter of international concern. The WikiLeaks founder finds himself at the center of a political scandal that has ensnared the people he helped liberate from oppressive regimes. At the end of August 2010, the Swedish government announced that it was seeking Assange's extradition from its Swedish embassy in London. In the United States, the American government, which is pursuing the extradition, considers Assange to be an international criminal, not a terrorist or a security threat.This case serves as a case study in how a transnational, digital media organization using the internet to publish news and information has the ability to transform an individual in public policy debates. In the case of Julian Assange the use of the internet to provide a public service and to expose unlawful governmental and corporate activity becomes the catalyst for his personal, political, and legal issues.What followed was a saga of legal and political action on all points of the compass that culminated in Assange's arrest on December 18, 2010. This included his extradition to Sweden and his eventual guilty plea on sexual assault charges in Sweden, by which he accepted a sentence of one year in jail, as well	0
After several months of airstrikes, the international coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria has failed to dismantle the group's structure of command and has pushed its militants further beyond the country's borders. Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict. Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U.N. Security Council approval, the U.S. strikes lacked legitimacy. But in comments to media he said: "Anyway, if their aim is to strike against ISIS, it's OK." Does this statement mean that the Syrian government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power? Does the old Arab proverb the "enemy of my enemy is my friend" apply to this case and to the reality on the ground? In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime. Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria. Other opposition groups -- including the Free Syrian Army -- are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes. The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories. Although the Gulf states would like to see an anti-ISIS offensive that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Syrian government, the U.S. and Western allies have made it clear that regime change is not an objective of this military campaign. Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure. Thus the Syrian government has found the U.S., Western allies, and Arab states on the side of its own allies Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran -- aiding Assad against one of his most powerful and influential threats. Ironically, the same nations that may have indirectly contributed to the creation of ISIS itself, are now investing their military capital into fighting it. So far, however, the balance of power has not shifted significantly either in favor of the government forces or rebel groups. ISIS has been pushed out of some territories, but is advancing in others. Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes. Strategically, Assad needs to focus on holding the large cities already under government control. Civilian suffering	1
Israel's attack Monday on a boat traveling in international waters and carrying humanitarian supplies for Gaza killed at least nine people and sparked a series of recriminations around the world. Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the  United Nations and the Arab League told reporters that Israel's attack was a "terrorist action" that violated international law.B'Tselem, a human rights organization, described the attack as "the most serious act of aggression against civilians in two years," and said the Israeli military had warned of the dangers before the attack.Israel has denied attacking the boat, saying that the rocket-propelled grenades were launched by the same group that launched an earlier, failed attempt to attack the Gaza crossing in September.The Israeli military said the attack came from a boat, without providing further details on the boat and the type of rocket it was carrying. Defense officials, though, have said such attacks are carried out by the military itself and not by private groups."This attack targeted a group of individuals armed with homemade rockets, including Grad missiles, while the captain and passengers sought to rescue injured passengers onboard," the Israeli military said.The UN, which suspended the Gaza-Israel civilian crossing in 2000 over the threat of cross-border attacks, called the attack a "serious violation of international humanitarian law, a war crime and an act of blatant aggression."The organization described the incident as a possible escalation in Israel's efforts to prevent Gaza-bound humanitarian aid from reaching the Palestinian people."The secretary-general expresses grave concern, as does the Arab League, at the escalation in Israel's actions against medical and humanitarian aid being delivered to the Palestinian people," a UN statement said.The organization's acting regional representative, Farhan Haq, told reporters in Geneva that Israel's actions "are flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and an incitement to violent resistance against international humanitarian law.""This could constitute an escalation in Israel's ongoing campaign against humanitarian aid and medical aid that is being delivered to the Palestinian people," Haq said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not commented on reports of a possible war crime.The New York Times reports that the United Nations human rights chief has formally condemned the strike on the Gaza boat."I strongly condemn the attack made by Israel on the civilian boat that was carrying relief supplies to Gaza that killed those aboard," said Lynn Maalouf	0
Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling asked a Los Angeles probate court Wednesday to uphold her negotiated sale of the team for $2 billion despite her husband's objections, her attorney said. The probate court agreed to hold a hearing on the matter on Friday.Attorney Frank Pierson said the couple filed a lawsuit last week seeking to stop the sale, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday."Under no circumstances does the sale ... constitute any gift to the plaintiff," he said.Sterling's lawsuit contends that the sale to the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, which included the team's name, uniforms, coaches and players, is invalid because the Clippers were sold as an ongoing asset, not an ongoing business, according to the lawsuit.The NBA last month agreed to let the sale through. The two sides had been at odds since Sterling purchased the Clippers in 1981.The lawsuit was brought by Sterling and his wife, who are separated and have no children, "for the benefit of their children ... and for the benefit of the NBA, the fans and the State of California," the lawsuit says.Sterling's attorney said "we will have a hearing on Friday morning, and we'll tell the judge how much we're willing to drop."The attorney for the NBA, Mark Geragos, said in a statement the league believes the sale is valid."I think it's time to move on. At least we're moving forward," Geragos said.The NBA announced it planned to buy the Clippers as recently as June 2012, a year before Sterling bought them as an NBA-mandated owner.Geragos said in a statement that he was "appalled by our former owner's behavior and the damage he's done to the NBA, the league and the fans."This process has been going on for nine years, and we are confident the NBA and the Los Angeles Clippers will emerge with a new vision in place with a new ownership group lead by Sterling and Sterling's family," Geragos said.The lawsuit says the sale is invalid "because the Clippers are not an ongoing business as required by the NBA's constitution.""For the NBA to now, on the eve of the NBA season, make this public proposal to buy the LA Clippers and allow it to be voted on should have alerted all	0
Abu Dhabi stepped in to help troubled fellow emirate Dubai and its state-owned holding company, Dubai World, with $10 billion in financing on Monday. The announcement by the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee comes as $4.1 billion in Islamic bonds became due today. "The remaining funds would also provide for interest expenses and company working capital through April 30, 2010 - conditioned on the company being successful in negotiating a standstill as previously announced," Sheikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee said in a statement released Monday. Dubai World shocked investors globally when it asked Nov. 25 for a debt standstill at Dubai World, the government's flagship holding company, for payments owed on its $26 billion in debts. The holding company includes DP World, the shipping magnate, Nakheel, developer of some of the city's largest projects and investment company Ishitar. Some of its foreign investments include the QE2 cruise liner and Cirque du Soleil. The company asked for a standstill of debts owed until May 30 as it begins restructuring its debt. "Today the Government of Dubai will announce a comprehensive reorganization law, a framework that is based upon internationally accepted standards for transparency and creditor protection," the statement said. "This law will be available should Dubai World and its subsidiaries be unable to achieve an acceptable restructuring of its remaining obligations."	1
Software mogul John McAfee could be deported to Belize on Thursday after being detained by immigration officials, a Guatemalan official said. Authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for the Guatemalan consul in Miami.As reported in the Miami Herald, Cuevas said that McAfee was being held at a federal detention facility, but would be transferred to the Belize Immigration Detention Centre, where he would be deported.Cuevas did not confirm the immigration status of McAfee, who was arrested Wednesday afternoon at a Miami hotel where he was staying with his partner, Belizean journalist Carlotta Xuluaga."He has no criminal record, he has no prior offenses, he has no ties," Cuevas said of McAfee. "He's a citizen of Belize, he's a journalist. I'm not able to discuss the conditions of his detention."The Herald also reported that McAfee is a wealthy U.S. citizen, who bought Belizean government bonds worth $100 million and is worth "hundreds of millions of dollars."McAfee purchased the bonds through a private company, and then used his own money to buy back the bonds three years ago, the newspaper said.John McAfeeIt was not immediately clear what McAfee's immigration status was or how he wound up in the U.S. since he lives in Belize.McAfee last month was arrested when U.S. immigration officials discovered that he had been living in the U.S.The Belize National Accord government issued a statement Wednesday saying that the arrest was "a result of an ongoing criminal investigation." It did not say what that investigation was over immigration violations.It was not immediately clear what had led to the investigation.McAfee's partner, Belizean journalist Carlotta Xuluaga, told the Associated Press that her "jurisdiction is not going to allow us to continue to talk to him on any matter of immigration that he does not need to speak to.""His immigration status is one thing, and we are not going to allow him to be deported and we are going to continue to seek justice for what has happened," she said. "John and I have always been open about our marriage, and we are not going to compromise on our relationship. We're going to fight this matter and will	0
In a case that Pope Francis says he's taken an interest in after speaking to one of the alleged victims, a Spanish judge on Wednesday filed preliminary charges of sexual abuse against three Catholic priests and a religious teacher. Investigating magistrate Antonio Moreno, in the southern city of Granada, ordered the suspected ringleader, a priest, to post a $12,500 bond in order to leave jail, according to a court statement and spokeswoman. The suspect posted the bond, and Moreno released the others from custody without bond, the statement said. The four must report regularly to authorities and can't have any contact or communication with two alleged male victims, the court statement said. The judge's decision came two days after the four were arrested, and just a day after Pope Francis told reporters that he called an alleged victim in August and urged him to come forward to authorities in Spain. "The truth is the truth, and we must not hide it," Pope Francis said aboard the papal plane, CNN Vatican contributor John Allen reported in a story for the Boston Globe. The Pope confirmed that he received a letter from a young man describing his plight. "I received it and I read it," Pope Francis said of the letter. "I called the person and said, 'Tomorrow go to your bishop.' I wrote to the bishop so he could start his work, do the investigation and go ahead," the Pope said, Allen reported for the Globe. Spanish media have credited the young man's letter to the Vatican -- alleging the abuse when he was a teenaged altar boy -- and then the surprise phone call from the Pope as big steps toward preventing the events from remaining a dark secret. Attorney Javier Muriel, representing all four defendants, told CNN that they deny the charges, while acknowledging they know the man who brought the complaint. The court investigation is under seal, and since it began, a second man has come forward to allege similar abuses. The Andalusia regional government's education department in Granada is moving to terminate the contract for the high school religion teacher who's facing the preliminary charges. He's been teaching for seven years, up until Friday, but authorities do not want him back in the classroom, a department spokeswoman told CNN.	1
Joe McGinniss could not believe his eyes. The man he saw in a North Carolina courtroom last week was stooped and shackled, hardly the same smooth and swaggering Jeffrey MacDonald who had told his story so many years ago. To say the author and the convicted killer have a history would be an understatement. If anything, their first face-to-face meeting in 35 years was anticlimactic. "He looked like a shadow," McGinniss said of MacDonald, now 68, who some believe the author betrayed for his 1983 best-selling book "Fatal Vision." "He has a pallor, there was no substance to him," McGinniss continued. "I guess many years in prison can do that to you." McGinniss testified earlier this month for the prosecution at a federal hearing in Wilmington, North Carolina, that could determine whether or not MacDonald deserves freedom, or at least a new trial. MacDonald's lawyers assert that newly-discovered DNA evidence -- three hairs that match neither MacDonald nor any of the victims -- and the secondhand confession of a key witness who claimed to be at the family's home the night of the murders justify reopening the case. Judge hears new evidence in 'Fatal Vision' case McGinniss said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be "the Holy Grail," MacDonald's last chance at freedom. He remains convinced of MacDonald's guilt. The attorneys finished their closing arguments on Monday, and the decision is now in the hands of U.S. District Judge John C. Fox. The judge could let MacDonald's murder convictions stand, toss them out, or order another trial. It is expected to take weeks, perhaps months, before a ruling comes in a criminal saga that has made headlines for four decades. It began when military police officers were summoned to the MacDonald home at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on February 17, 1970. Inside, they found a horrific crime scene. MacDonald's pregnant wife, Colette, was stabbed 16 times with a knife and 21 times with an ice pick. Daughter Kimberly, 5, was bludgeoned and stabbed in the neck. Kristen, 2, was stabbed 48 times; a finger was nearly severed as she tried to fend off the blows. "It was overkill," said McGinniss, who wrote that MacDonald killed his family in an amphetamine-fueled rage.	1
More than 70 members of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram have been killed during a Nigerian military operation in the northeastern state of Borno, an Army spokesman told CNN on Friday. The military "remains on the offensive," Â Lt. Col. Murtala Muhammed told CNN.Muhammed said the latest airstrikes, which were carried out from air bases in neighbouring Chad, began Friday morning and were continued Sunday.He added that all those slain were "fighters by the names of 'An-Naba' and 'Abubakar' but they were only known as Abu Waleed Al-Ansari and Abu Yahaya Aleyami."Boko Haram, which is known also known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, or the Boko Haram, claimed responsibility for killing more than 200 people in the area.Boko Haram's "siege of Nnewi has been repelled."The group, which is seeking to overthrow and establish an Islamic state in Nigeria with a strict version of Sharia on land, has seized large chunks of northeastern Nigeria.It also is being blamed for two attacks in recent days on the West African country's north and south-central regions, killing more than 100 people and burning several villages.Both attacks were claimed by the group.As CNN reported on Wednesday, the northern village of Damboa was burned and six people killed when fighters blew up the village's market, the first major attack in recent months in what is considered a hotbed for Islamic extremist activity.The village lies in the northeastern region that is home to a major oil field and trade routes.However, there have been no reported deaths in the region that are attributed to the Boko Haram attack, CNN said.On Thursday the group carried out a suicide car bombing targeting a police station in the town of Madala.One policeman died and five others were wounded in the attack as they sat on the ground and looked on.The attacks have left at least 29 people dead in Borno State, according to the BBC, and at least 35 people in the past 10 days. The latest reported deaths came Tuesday when the group claimed the deaths of seven soldiers in the Abuja suburb of Baga.The group has been blamed for the killing of more than 200 people in the northeast over the past decade or more.Last year, more	0
The power of women hit the State Department on Wednesday when first lady Michelle Obama joined Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to celebrate champions of women's rights around the world. Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton present the State Department Women of Courage Awards. The event was to celebrate the State Department Women of Courage Awards, but highlighted how both the current and former first ladies have made women's rights a signature issue. Since calling women's rights a human rights issue at a women's conference in Beijing in 1995, Clinton has made it a personal mission to champion the rights of women. Her first two trips as secretary of state have been packed with events promoting the importance of women's rights. "These personal experiences have informed my work, and I will continue to fight for human rights as secretary of state in traditional and especially nontraditional ways and venues," Clinton told the audience. You "can't solve problems of financial crisis, climate change, disease and poverty if half of the population is left behind," Clinton said. The rights of women will "always be central to our foreign policy." In a commentary published Monday in honor of International Women's Day, Clinton warned that "women still comprise the majority of the world's poor, unfed and unschooled." "Global problems are too big and too complex to be solved without the full participation of women," she wrote in the article, which ran in more than 50 newspapers around the world. "Strengthening women's rights is not only a continuing moral obligation -- it is also a necessity as we face a global economic crisis, the spread of terrorism and nuclear weapons, regional conflicts that threaten families and communities, and climate change and the dangers it presents to the world's health and security." Ambiga Sreenevasan, a Malaysian lawyer who won an award Wednesday for her work on behalf of justice for women, called Clinton "a woman of courage who has encouraged woman around the world." Clinton's speech declaring that women's rights are human rights, Sreenevasan said, has "resonated with a lot of us here." Clinton also heaped praise on the current first lady, saying that in a very short time, Michelle Obama "through her grace and her wisdom [has] become an inspiration to women and girls, not only in the United States, but around the world." Obama spoke about the importance of proper health care, education and justice for women in ensuring strong families and communities.	1
U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, suspected of leaking classified information to the WikiLeaks website, is being moved to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, defense officials said Tuesday. "At this juncture of the case, given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement, we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at Fort Leavenworth is the most appropriate one for Private Manning going forward," Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson told reporters. A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, but later corrected that information. Manning, 23, a military intelligence analyst from Oklahoma, was being held in the brig at Quantico Marine Base south of Washington. There had been a push by friends and supporters to have his confinement conditions eased. Supporters said he was confined in a one-man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise. Defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether Manning is competent has been completed, and there was no need for him to remain in the Washington area. Among those arrested at a demonstration protesting Manning's conditions last month were Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 to the New York Times and retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who resigned to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Johnson told reporters that the decision to move Manning is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did "in difficult circumstances." "We remain satisfied that Private Manning's pre-trial confinement at Quantico was in compliance with legal and regulatory standards in all respects," he said. Manning's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley and Crowley's sudden resignation. Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day, Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico, calling it "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid," according to news reports. He later stepped down from his post. The Pentagon has maintained that Manning is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico, for his protection and the safety of others, and that Manning is on "POI" status, for "prevention of injury."	1
Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law. He's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog, but the California Supreme  Court's June decision to stop the government from deporting him, for two more years at least, has created a new wave of interest, leading to his own lawsuit.Garcia, who lives in Los Angeles with his husband, works, and pays taxes, considers himself an American. He says he came to the U.S. legally in 1986. He was born in Mexico and has a U.S. birth certificate from 1985 showing his mother as a U.S. citizen. He is no longer part of the "illegal alien" category and has been an American citizen since 2001. But a lack of documentation remains a barrier in his quest to become a U.S. lawyer.Garcia has won the lottery.After the June 23 ruling, which he called "a very grave, very troubling decision," the government must now allow him two more years for a green card. But he has had to wait years — and thousands of dollars in fees — to get it, he says, because the government has not always honored its promise to expedite his cases. "I paid thousands of dollars in fees to them to process my visa, and then I have to pay my own fees to renew my visa to stay," he says. When the decision was announced, Garcia immediately contacted his former Congressman and asked him to help get his case overturned.And he has a campaign to make sure he gains the legal immigration reform he feels is necessary. "I feel that this is going to happen. And I'm prepared," he says.Garcia says he was born on October 18, 1973, and is a naturalized citizen, but never used the right to vote legally as an American citizen, even when he was a college student. So he's not eligible to vote to become a U.S. citizen because he did not "have the legal status to do so as a naturalized citizen and did not pay all the legal fees and penalties for having done so." Although he has lived in the U.S. since 1985, he first came to the country illegally in 1986. He was not deported until May 1999 after serving three years in state prison	0
Monday, the official first day of winter, airlines were scrambling to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellation of hundreds of flights after a monster weekend winter storm blanketed a swath of the East Coast. Charlene Fisk, a filmmaker from Atlanta, Georgia, tried her best not to lose it at Hartsfield International Airport on Monday at 4:30 a.m. when she found out she wouldn't be getting home to upstate New York anytime soon. Her US Airways connecting flight had been canceled, so she was placed on another flight to Philadelphia, which was then canceled. She's going to have to fly to Chicago on Monday evening, hopefully stay the night with friends and then hop on a standby flight to Syracuse. Her family will have to drive about an hour from their home to pick her up. "Passengers are talking about renting cars together and just driving home," Fisk said. US Airways is picking up the tab to fly Fisk to Chicago. And while some airlines are offering refunds, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the company is providing weather waivers that allow passengers to reschedule without a penalty if they were scheduled to travel before Christmas. Another strong winter system will be developing by Tuesday in the Rockies. The system will take a track through the central Plains, Midwest, and into the western Great Lakes. Winter storm and blizzard watches are already in effect for the Central Plains for Tuesday night through Thursday. Severe weather also will be possible from Dallas and Houston, Texas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. On Monday, CNN correspondent Susan Candiotti was taking her first day of vacation when she began a chaotic journey from Newark, New Jersey. Already with boarding pass in hand, she spent nearly two hours in three different lines because agents were unsure which line passengers should be in, she said. Another agent eventually told Candiotti and others to go directly to TSA security where they got in another line. A different Continental agent then lead them to an upper floor to check their bags. Then, they were sent back to security and she made it to her  8:45 a.m. flight gate with 10 minutes to spare only to learn that the flight had been postponed until around 11 a.m., when it eventually took off for Columbus, Ohio. Her final destination is northern Kentucky which she'll eventually reach once her sister picks her up in Ohio and drives her home.	1
The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy. Having served with and cared for those brave men and women as a physician in the Army Reserve with three deployments  away from one another, when we looked at the case in the light of the history of wars that have been lost, the risk of casualties and the cost to our economy, my colleagues and I and many in the House thought it was the right decision to do so. This was a difficult decision that we were asked to make, but one that I believe we made the right decision for the United States of America, and I cannot see a reason why it should be revisited.This is a matter of national security, and I have no disagreement with the President. The National Security Strategy that was signed by the President and the Secretary of Defense provides a sound strategy for the United States to confront a more aggressive China, and in the years ahead we have an opportunity to make a major contribution to peace and security in this part of the world.This decision can only be made with the full knowledge and support of the Congress of the United States, and I am grateful that the leadership of the House of Representatives has taken this action.With the assistance and guidance of Congress, I have and will continue to implement my responsibilities to lead the nation in its efforts to improve the quality of life for all Americans. I have faith in the ability of the United States Congress, which is the constitutional home of the Congress, and I am certain that it will agree with my decision to support this action, as it did when it voted to remove the United States from the Biological Weapons Convention. I thank the many honorable, dedicated men and women serving in the United States Armed Forces who have made these wars so much more difficult to fight, and I thank the many dedicated patriots on the home front who have been willing to risk their lives on behalf of the security of our nation.I do not believe that it is a correct characterization of our decision to remove the United States from the Biological Weapons Convention as an effort to "get tough" on China. It is our right to challenge China's policies and actions around the world, and the removal of the United States from the Biological Weapons Convention recognizes that the United States cannot afford to surrender its right to defend its citizens and its security interests around the world.	0
Cyber criminals are setting snares that move at the speed of news. Savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the Internet. Panda Security, a Spain-based antivirus maker, has been monitoring an onslaught of links with malicious software, or "malware," on Twitter that tag hot topics such as the Air France crash, the NBA finals, "American Idol" runner-up Adam Lambert and the new iPhone. "Cyber criminals have been targeting Twitter users by creating thousands of messages (tweets) embedded with words involving trending topics and malicious URLs," Sean-Paul Correll, a threat researcher for Panda Labs, wrote recently on a blog for the company. The growing sophistication of malware attacks mirrors the growing threat -- and cash -- generated by online crime. Already, cyber crime is estimated to cost companies and consumers more than $100 billion worldwide. Some officials claim it has now eclipsed illegal drugs as a criminal moneymaker. "It's very seldom reported ... if discovered by companies, they generally don't want the public to know they've been had," said Eugene Spafford, a computer security specialist at Purdue University who has advised two U.S. presidents and numerous companies and government agencies. Cyber crime is one of the few industries benefiting from the financial crisis. Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined. In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year. Companies lost an average of $4.6 million in intellectual property last year, according to a survey of 1000 firms worldwide by Purdue University and McAfee. "As the economy has declined, we've seen the threat landscape increase," David DeWalt, president and CEO of McAfee, recently told Richard Quest for CNN International's "Quest Means Business." That increase has helped antivirus makers such as McAfee snare record returns -- the company's first quarter profits were 21 percent higher than same period last year. But companies and governments find themselves in a losing war with Web-savvy criminals, experts say. "The fundamental fact is cyber criminals are highly organized with sophisticated corporate structures and business chains," said Michael Fraser, director of the Communications Law Centre at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. "They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal," Fraser said.	1
European leaders are meeting in Brussels Thursday to discuss further sanctions against Russia. So far the EU has imposed financial and visa restrictions against 21 carefully selected Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but avoided anyone from President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and stayed clear of any large-scale economic sanctions. The EU and U.S. have condemned Russian annexation of Crimea as illegal and stepped up their rhetoric towards the Kremlin, but whether they are willing to put more economic pressure on Russia is unclear. The leaders of Europe's biggest economies are likely to be cautious. Here's why. How important is Russia's economy? Russia is the eight biggest economy in the world, with GDP of more than $2 trillion. But its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities, particularly oil and gas, was growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012, one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets. With the Ukraine crisis taking its toll, Russia's economy may not grow at all in 2014, some analysts have warned. Hopes Russia would be one of the decade's powerhouse economies may have faded, but its close links with the European Union have not. Would sanctions hit Europe back? The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two. Almost half of Russia's exports -- $292 billion worth -- end up in EU countries. 15% of Russia's GDP comes directly from the country's exports to EU. Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports. But the eurozone itself has only just emerged from its own crisis, and is wary of cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner. Its reliance on gas out of Russia would also feed caution. Robert Pape, political science professor at University of Chicago with expertise in security studies, says the sanctions would hurt both sides. "Between great powers, leverage is a two-way street, Russia can squeeze us almost as effectively as we can squeeze them," Pape wrote for CNN. While steps that would push the price of oil down for a sustained period would really bite, these would be hitting right back. Energy supplies remain vitally important for the European Union, to which Russia supplies a third of EU's natural gas. Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. What is Russia's economic relationship with the U.S?	1
An Army officer testifying at a military hearing Wednesday that he first thought the rapid rate of gunfire suggested there was more than one shooter in last November's Fort Hood massacre. Maj. Stephen Richter of the Army Medical  Corps testified that he went to a back room in the building where he worked at 2:20 a.m. Nov. 5, when the shooting began. He went through his training and began pulling people out of the building to "take care of the wounded." Richter and other soldiers testified that in that moment they didn't think the shootings happened at the first shot, and Richter testified he told his superiors about the second shooting.What's wrong in the story?The report doesn't give much information about what happened in the aftermath of the shooting.Some say Richter could have been the only person to witness the shooting and the other soldiers were just passing through.Some say the incident may have been witnessed by some of the 200 people the shooting killed.What's wrong in the story?In an interview Monday night, Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin told Fox News that he and another military leader were trying to determine who was a shooter and who was victim in the shooting."We were trying to determine who committed all the acts," Austin said.How does that look?At least three military officials — including Lt. Gen. Austin — say the shooting appeared random and that two shooters apparently fired in that chaotic aftermath.The FBI, meanwhile, interviewed all the people who survived the shooting and they say there were no signs anything happened at the same time, although some may have seen something.How does that look?The FBI interviewed several people, but never had an in-person interview with the shooter, so the FBI never interviewed him.The FBI interviewed about 70 people in the days and weeks after the shooting, and again after a gunman killed a soldier in December.And while the FBI says it is still collecting evidence, FBI Director Robert Mueller told the committee it is working to make sure there are no leads.The FBI told the committee: "We don’t believe there are any leads at all in this case."How does that look?The FBI says it is investigating any reports of a possible third shooter.Why not a fourth shooter?The FBI interviews	0
China's status a business superpower is transferring to the sporting world -- and its golfing ambitions took another step towards the big leagues on Sunday. Organizers of the HSBC Champions tournament announced that it has been iced out of the draw for the European Tour tournament after refusing to allow men from the Communist state of China to take part.China is the only country that is not allowed to play in the Champions tour. The organizers of the tournament had said in a statement that they would be hosting the event, the HSBC Champions Tour Championship, in 2014 unless the tour were denied this year's tournament."There certainly isn't room for one more Chinese player competing in the European Tour, so this request has been denied," Peter Alliss, the chairman of the European Tour, told Sky Sports News.The organizers of the event had expressed fears that the government might take further action against the Chinese when the country's first major event was being held in Shanghai with the International Champions Cup and an F1 Grand Prix race."If the Chinese government wants to come and play the Champions Tour, then they must first play the Grand Prix [races]," Alliss said.The European Tour had asked the Shanghai International Sports Federation for permission to host the 2015 edition of the tournament. But the event was stopped when the Chinese government gave the tour the okay to host the event but denied the club in question from participating."I'm not here to be critical," Alliss admitted. "The organizers decided what they wanted to do. This shows the Chinese government is not open to change."Alliss said he would be looking at future tournaments to hold if such problems would arise again."At the end of the day, the people of the world are going to be looking at what we do here, and what will be the impact on them if we do business in the wrong way," the tour chairman said."It's one of the reasons you see us doing business in the U.S., because we recognize there are going to be risks.Golf is China's top sport. It is more popular than football, its national game, with nearly half of the population of 600 million playing. And the sport is growing rapidly. At least half of the more than 200,000 golf courses are currently under construction in the country.The PGA Tour is looking at increasing investment in China as the growth potential	0
Mikey Welsh, most famously known as the bassist for the rock band Weezer, died unexpectedly Saturday, according to the band. He was 40. The band was forced to cancel two shows Wednesday night because of his illness before they were able to reschedule them for the following day. Welsh's sudden death was reported by several sources on Twitter Sunday afternoon. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead around 1:20 a.m. on Saturday. The band is working with his family and are hoping for privacy.Welsh, most famously known as the lead guitarist and songwriter of the pop band Weezer, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital Sunday morning where he was pronounced dead. Weezer, in a press release, said they hoped his "passion for music and the freedom to express himself helped to inspire others who suffered similar experiences." The band continued, "The world lost one of its brightest. Our hearts are broken and we will miss him forever." Welsh wrote the band's most well-known songs and performed on most of their albums and tours.Welsh was a veteran musician, including being a founding member of the rock band Weezer, who rose to fame while in high school before he graduated from the University of Arizona. He later formed the alternative rock band Silver Chair, which performed in Los Angeles, for which he gained some recognition as a musician in the mid-2000s before he formed the Weezer band with Michael Stipe, Mikey Celli, Patrick Wilson and Pete Droge. Welsh, who was best known for his songwriting, gained both critical and commercial success throughout his career.Weezer, who were established in 1995, have sold over 70 million albums worldwide and have played over 250 shows. The band was one of the more successful alternative rock bands of the 2000s, but they also received controversy for performing at a concert at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, which was sponsored by Monster. The band performed at the awards show held in September of that year, two days before Welsh died. Welsh was forced to cancel two scheduled shows due to health issues.In an email to his fans on his website, Welsh wrote, "As a tribute to the band and the love that you all gave to have music be part of your lives and for you to feel that connection to the words that I wrote, I've decided to give up my career	0
I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. "Marijuana...?" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, "I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing." I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, "You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering."	1
The northern Indian city of Meerut was both panicked and intrigued by a leopard on the loose on Sunday, which has eluded captors since. The big cat was found in a local timber shop before being cornered in a nearby hospital, local forest official Sushant Sharma told CNN on Tuesday. Animal control experts were called to tranquilize the animal, which made a daring escape, breaking a window in the room to make its getaway. After breaking out of the hospital it went into a cinema and later also entered an apartment block. Stunning photographs purport to show the leopard leaping across rooftops, squeezing through a hole in the wall of the Meerut Cantonment Hospital, and snarling at a baton-wielding official through a window. Crowds complicate capture efforts The cat sparked more inquisitiveness than trepidation as onlookers crowded around the site of the cat's incarceration, hampering efforts by the authorities to capture and release the leopard. "It got agitated and escaped," Sharma said. But curiosity got the better of some in the crowd. Seven people were injured by the leopard, including a policeman who needed treatment for a gash on the shoulder. No sightings were confirmed on Monday and Sushant did not rule out the possibility the leopard had retreated into the forests. "Nothing happened (Monday). So, there are chances it could have gone back to the forests. But we are still trying to track it," Sharma said. Leopard suspected of eating 15 people in Nepal Human encroachment The incident is the latest in a series of big cat attacks in India, including at least one alleged man-eater, also in Uttar Pradesh, home to one of the world's last remaining tiger habitats. A leopard also mauled a 5-year-old boy to death in the eastern state of Chhattisgarh last week. The increasing number of sightings -- and attacks -- by big cats in India is raising the issue of human encroachment on wild animal habitats. "There are many cases where human habitats are encroaching on those of big cats, which are getting lesser and lesser over the years," said Jimmy Borah, Tiger Coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund India. "The cats are forced to come out of their habitats to look for food. There is lots of habitat loss and with that food source loss -- it's one of the main problems, which is why they are coming out."	1
Once upon a time, bookshelves were just for books, a spot to proudly show off your full set of encyclopedias before the advent of Google. These days, homeowners have a more open-minded approach to their shelving. The books are still there, but decorating enthusiasts are using them as elements of decor. HGTV magazine Editor-in-Chief Sara Peterson said that's because finding colorful and affordable home accessories is a lot easier than it used to be. As a result, "restyling your bookshelves can be a fast makeover that can totally change the look and feel of a room," Peterson said. In addition to being a collection of well-loved stories, a stack of books can serve as a base for decorative objects. "The key to styling out bookshelves is to have a wide variety of objects to play with," she said. All different sizes of books, vases, boxes and framed photos bring a bookcase to life. Not only that, but the shelves themselves can be part of the arrangement. "We're also seeing people line the backs of the bookshelves with wallpaper or even painting the backs, which gives everything on the shelves more of a cohesive look," Peterson said. The possibilities seem endless, and therein lies the problem, said e-designer Jana Bek. Communicating via Facetime, phone and e-mail, Bek provides interior designs and blueprints for her clients around the world to implement on their own. When it comes to decorating shelves, the instructions she provides come with an encouragement to be patient. "Styling bookshelves is always a tricky process," Bek said. "It looks easy but it takes finessing." It's about balancing the size of the objects placed on the entire bookshelf, she said, paying attention to scale and shape. For example, Bek places larger decorative items on the top and bottom shelves while keeping items with intricate detail on eye level. And since books and picture frames are often rectangular, she breaks up all the angles with other shapes to keep things interesting. Here's what Open House contributors learned about decorating their own bookcases: -- "I learned that large bookcases eat up accessories. I had what I thought was more than enough to fill the shelves. It turned out I needed more!" -- Lori Evans, Gainesville, Florida.	1
Out of an abundance of caution," American Airlines said Tuesday it would inspect 47 Boeing 757 airplanes after seats on two of the company's jetliners came loose.

Teenage golf sensation Noh Seung-Yul has entered the sport's record books as the youngest player to top the Asian Tour's money list. The 19-year-old, who won $822,361 on his way to becoming  the youngest Asian Tour player, becomes only the second South Korean ever to break $1 million on the LPGA.According to the AAGPBL, Seung-Yul, who hails from Busan, broke the record by just over a pound (0.5 kilogram) on his 14th hole and by .0043 of a unit on the last hole.With the money he has earned, Seung-Yul can buy 20 new computers for his family. "It feels amazing to break the record on a first major victory," said Seung-Yul. "This record will help me to buy a lot of things for my family. Every time they buy something, I thank the record holder."Seung-Yul's success on the Asian Tour, a circuit which is the second highest-earning of the major tours, also marks his first major career earnings at the highest level. The LPGA career earnings record for an Asian Tour player was previously held by Taiwanese player and mother of golf's world champion, Hsu Chi-Chung, who made $1,066,863 in 1996.It is not entirely understood how young Seung-Yul reached the top of the money list in his first year, but he certainly has an impressive resume.When he was a senior in high school, Seung-Yul was voted the nation's top junior golfer, although he only played eight events during the regular season and did not contend in any of them. However, he did win three events in the Under-18 Taiwan tournament, including two that were decided on the final hole.And, more recently, he became the youngest player to win the Taiwan Under-18 championship, which he dominated by winning two of the three events, and also his first victory at the Taiwan Open, where he won on the first leg of the final playoff with an even par score of -12, three strokes ahead.In addition, the Lanyang Koo Koo won the Thailand Under-18 championship this year, where they finished fourth."I feel happy that my first major victory is	0
Federal civil rights investigators have found "reasonable cause" to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use "unnecessary or unreasonable force" with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said. The department's civil  rights division described the use of force at the hands of police as a "systemic problem that is growing" in recent years.Police used force in 43 percent of all contacts with persons with mental illness in 2016, the Justice Department said. In eight of those cases, officers used force in ways that are "unreasonable," the department said."These findings are a major step forward in ensuring the public trusts the police," Eric Rosenbaum, general counsel for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.“Police have a responsibility to use force only when there are circumstances that warrant it, and their actions must be proportional to the threatening situation," Rosenbaum said. "The Justice Department is committed to ensuring that officers do not use unnecessary or excessive force," he added.Portland police, meanwhile, will continue to work to resolve conflicts "without fear or favor," Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said on Monday.Portland police last reported on the use-of-force question in 2009, when the department said it investigated a total of 15,942 use-of-force incidents between 2008 and 2009. During that time, officers were justified in 37 percent of those use-of-force cases, but they used force with people who were restrained or on their stomachs in 24 percent of those incidents."Officers are required to take a number of actions, most notably, the use of force, before they even contact someone for a mental health concern," Portland Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Monday. "These officers were taking those actions when this incident occurred."The officer, who has not been identified, is no longer an employee of the Portland Police Bureau, according to the department. The man is still employed by the agency.The officer was charged with unlawful restraint, unlawful restraint, assault on a peace officer and third-degree criminal mischief.In addition to the officer, one police officer will receive a letter of reprimand, and another will receive a letter of reprimand or a written reprimand.The officer has been placed on administrative leave, a bureau spokesman said.Police have	0
Last week the news broke that the world's largest permissions-based e-mail marketing company, Epsilon, had been hacked -- compromising the security of an unknown number of e-mail addresses and names. Major vernacular of this nature is hacker: one that, if taken too far, can cost a company, or indeed a person, their livelihoods. I don't know about you, but I'd been in close contact with the CEO of Epsilon for several months before learning of the breach. During those months, I heard and saw all sorts of e-mail from him, but his comments were always insightful, thoughtful, and, above all, trustworthy. He came across as an unusually trustworthy leader, someone I was eager to work alongside.Now, the reality of this situation is that if I were a senior executive at a company that used Epsilon services, I would be looking over my shoulder every other week for my own credentials. When an employee is compromised, it means that the breach occurred on the company's behalf. This is a nightmare for any large company because hackers don't often take a long time to get their hands on credentials, so you can't stop them as soon as they have them. It's also a nightmare for Epsilon customers, who are left wondering how to get their data back.In short, Epsilon customers are at risk.This isn't just an isolated incident. The company is experiencing significant outages, and its status page on Twitter tells us they’ve suffered a serious denial of service (DOS) attack, which would be crippling if it were directed at a smaller entity. The company's website was also recently hacked, a feat which makes it seem like every week is another day that a major security breach takes place against Epsilon.The company's Twitter account tweeted out a statement on November 6 that they were "seriously concerned" about the situation, but, as I discussed with Epsilon's CEO, Dan Romero, I have a question for him. This is a company that's publicly announcing that it's concerned about the security of its own e-mail system, and he's not giving me an answer.The truth is that an organization of this size needs to be even more security-minded than your average e-tailer. While the average e-tailer has a few dozen customers, the Epsilon email system is used by some 1,000 customers,	0

Whether you're seeking a blissful beach retreat, a funky conversion or the perfect exotic hideaway, there's a hotel for nearly everyone on the third annual Fodor's 100 Hotel Awards, released Friday. This year's winners came from 43 countries, with Europe dominating the list with 30 hotels and the United States coming in second with 28 hotels. The list also includes newcomers from Myanmar and Colombia. Fodor's 500 global contributors nominated 4,000 hotels from the 17,000 properties they review annually, which include Fodor's Choice picks. Fourteen Fodor's editors chose the winners from the nominations. Award winners fell into one the following eight categories: Blissful beach retreats, creative conversions, culinary gems, enduring classics, exotic hideaways, home suite homes, local characters and sleek city addresses. "What's really nice about this list is there's something on this list for everyone. It's not just about out-of-reach options. There are interesting places for people to stay at any price point," says Arabella Bowen, Fodor's Travel executive editorial director. CNN.com asked Fodor's to choose one hotel in each category to recommend to our readers. Click on the gallery to see if you agree with their choices.	1
It's become a go-to tool for journalists, a digital man-on-the-street interview when big news breaks: see what they're saying on Twitter. There's just one problem with that, says the Pew Research Center. Opinions expressed through Twitter are often wildly off the mark.You may have come across a tweet from a politician saying something to his or her base, or a celebrity tweeting about a scandal (or a new job opening), or an online commentator saying something about a national news story. All of those tweets may seem legitimate, but they aren't necessarily so.Those who use Twitter to share opinions aren't the only ones who get it wrong. The truth is, Twitter users can get it pretty, pretty wrong. The Pew Research Center study, which looks at Twitter's effects on public opinion, found that more than half of everything a Twitter user tweets about in one 24-hour period may be a false positive."The main problem is the very high stakes of an opinion being shared on social media," says study co-author and public opinion researcher Paul T. Steely White, a professor of communication at the University of Michigan.But it's not just opinion sharing that gets it wrong. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that, just as people get their information wrong, they get the facts wrong when they share news with friends. Social media can make or break a story, but people are likely to misattribute the sources of a story. And they aren't always wrong.Here are four ways to avoid getting false views.1. Avoid taking things out of contextThe Pew Research Center's study found that most of what people read can be mistaken, even with the help of a dictionary. There are six basic ways that a person might confuse two things, and they all happen by taking something out of context:a. The problem gets worse when we use the wrong word or phraseThis happens, as the Pew Research Center says, when people "conflate" different news stories from different sources by using an inappropriate descriptor. "The term we use to describe someone who is a member of the Taliban is 'a member of the Taliban,' meaning that they belong to a religious group but are not physically located in a Taliban capital," Steely White says.This is a particularly troublesome one, he says, because there are differences in meaning between	0
Walking into the Khatmul Nabeen Masjid (mosque), you can for a moment forget that you're in Afghanistan. Beautiful buildings, walkways, flowerbeds and even a grass soccer pitch. Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law. Young men and women, dressed in Muslim attire, walk around freely and with smiles. Smiles are a bit of a rarity in today's Kabul, a polluted city of survival and despair, so this was both shocking and refreshing to me. We didn't have an appointment but we were hoping to interview Mohammed Asif Mohseni, a conservative Shia cleric. He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights. While security was checking our bags, one guard said that Mohseni had been waiting for us. I tried explaining that we did not have an appointment. Nonetheless, we were sent back to where Mohseni was waiting. Before entering the room I was cautioned by a guard to make sure none of my hair was showing below my headscarf. They were apologetic; one even asked me to zip up my sweater higher because too much of my neck was exposed. I complied, tucking in my hair and zipping my sweater as high as it could go. Now paranoid about the design holes in my scarf that exposed parts of my hair, I took off my shoes to enter. As we walked in, Mohseni, an older man with a white beard wearing a Shia-style turban called a "dulband" was sitting on a brown couch. He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, "These aren't the two I was waiting for." I explained that we just showed up for an interview because we did not have a number to reach him. He smiled and said, "I guess you are in luck." Mohseni welcomed us and asked me to translate his warm welcome to our Scottish cameraman. As the interview started, I noticed that Mohseni avoided my eyes. I wondered if it was because I was female. I was also prepared for verbal attacks; a journalist friend told me that when he brought a western journalist to interview Mohseni a few days ago, the journalist ended up having more questions thrown at him than he was able to ask.	1
Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.

The Pentagon's most expensive weapons program ever, the F-35 warplane, is cleared for takeoff again. The limited flight clearance, approved by Navy and Air Force officials Monday, allows the aircraft to fly with an engine inspection regimen  changed slightly and without a formal inspection of its engines. The Pentagon will also allow the aircraft to fly without a tailhook during low approaches. It's being allowed access to the same airfield where it is supposed to land as it did last month.These modifications were expected to cost $11.4 billion -- an amount that will add to the aircraft's price tag for the first time, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office. It will be the first time the Pentagon has purchased a new jet fighter with engine overhaul or modifications.For a generation, the Pentagon has been working to modernize the Air Force's F-22 Raptor, which was designed from the ground-up as part of the post-Cold War era military industrial complex, but that program was never able to go forward.The Air Force and the Navy are now facing a new program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project, which will cost around $400 billion and require the Pentagon to rebuild the plane. Unlike the Cold War-era F-22, the new fighter will be a combination of different types of systems.The new F-35 will include both stealthy stealth fighters as well as nuclear weapons, and it will also feature the F-35's advanced radar and infrared search system, called the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Head-Up Display, which will be capable of spotting and tracking aircraft in the air.On Monday, Defense Secretary James Mattis visited the F-35 development site in Mississippi, where he inspected the aircraft's test stand, and met with some of its designers. He'll go back to Washington, D.C. Tuesday to make the final decision on the F-35 program. The Air Force will have its first flight of the new aircraft on June 19.A Defense Department spokesman told TheBlaze in an email that Mattis “appreciated the dedication and professionalism of the team of highly skilled and talented individuals who have contributed to this program.”Some lawmakers had begun questioning the F-35 program in 2018, due to what they viewed as flaws in the plane's design, including lack of testing and readiness, and the Air Force's decision to allow the	0
The glitch-plagued rollout of President Barack Obama's signature health care law has been dogged by one big question: How many people have enrolled in an insurance plan? The White House refuses to release the numbers, leading many to assume they are embarrassingly low. But insurance industry insiders point to another reason: Nobody knows if the numbers they do have are even accurate. Turns out, some insurance companies say they are receiving data from the administration that is incomplete, duplicative or contradictory, making it difficult to get an accurate count of new enrollment. Opinion: Why healthcare.gov has so many problems So far, most of the attention has focused on people being unable to sign up for coverage through online health care exchanges. But even when customers manage to make it through the enrollment process, glitches persist. "The administration is not wrong in saying that there's been a lot of problems with signing up. But it's incorrect to say that's the only problem," an insurance industry official said. "That's not the only issue at hand." Industry officials who were contacted requested anonymity to speak candidly because of the superheated politics surrounding Obamacare. Opinion: Will glitches derail Obamacare? The sign-up process works this way: A person sets up an online account, verifies an identity, applies for coverage and subsidies and, if eligible, shops and enrolls for a plan. Once completed, information is sent to the insurance plans selected by the user. At 6 p.m. each day, the government sends the latest batch of new enrollees to insurance companies. But sometimes that data come with conflicting information, showing for instance, someone who enrolled and then canceled a plan, said an insurance industry executive. Other times data come in without a time stamp, making it difficult to track, the executive said. Adding to the confusion, the executive said, is that people are not officially enrolled in a plan until they pay their first premiums, which are not due until December 15. That means shoppers have about two months to cancel or switch plans before making a final decision of whether or not to enroll. Success on day 14 of Obamacare website An administration official did not dispute there have been problems with data sent by the government to insurers. "We know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works. As individual problems are raised by insurers, we work aggressively to address them," said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.	1
In the decade following the September 11, 2001, attacks, four CIA officers directly collaborated with the New York Police Department to expand NYPD's counterterrorism capabilities, according to a newly disclosed report. The CIA inspector general's report -- completed in late 2011, but just declassified in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by The New York Times -- raises concerns about the relationship between the organizations. The investigation found "irregular personnel practices" and "inadequate direction and control" by CIA managers "responsible for the relationship." "As a consequence, the risk to the Agency (CIA) is considerable and multifaceted," said a memo from Inspector General David Buckley to David Petraeus, who was the CIA director at the time. "While negative public perception is to be expected from the revelation of the agency's close and direct collaboration with any local domestic police department, a perception that the agency has exceeded its authorities diminishes the trust place in the organization." CIA agents are prohibited from taking part in domestic spying and the report's release comes in the immediate aftermath of leaks by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The investigation was launched after an Associated Press story that alleged "inappropriate CIA involvement in the activities of the New York Police Department," the inspector general's report said. The AP reported that the NYPD Intelligence Division dispatched CIA-trained undercover officers into minority neighborhoods to gather intelligence on daily life in mosques, cafes, bars and bookstores. It said New York police have used informers to monitor sermons during religious services and police officials keep tabs on clerics and gather intelligence on taxi cab drivers and food-cart vendors, who are often Muslim. The New York Police Department blasted the report as "fictional," at the time. A year ago, New Jersey Muslims filed a lawsuit against New York City, accusing police of using unconstitutional tactics to spy on them in the years after September 11. The NYPD later said the surveillance never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot. While the inspector general's report found no reason to order a full investigation into the relationship, it did note that the "risks ... were not fully considered." NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne hailed the cooperation between the agencies.	1
Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there. At least five people died on Tuesday, according to a resident who Â worked with a humanitarian agency in the city but gave only his surname, Abdallah.The attack came as Syrian government forces backed by Russian warplanes launched a major assault on rebel strongholds in the northwestern province, raising fears of a possible confrontation with Russia.The assault by Russian bombers and fighter jets on Tuesday struck rebel-held areas of the northern suburb of Al Bab, a rebel official told CNN."We were notified that a large number of Russian planes from the Russian Air Force struck the center of Al Bab city," said Mustafa Hashem, a spokesman for the rebels' local council in Latakia. He said he did not know if Russia had bombed more targets in the other Al Bab districts."At this moment there is no bombing in Al Bab," he said. "The Russian warplanes are destroying the rebels' infrastructure."An Al Bab resident who asked not to be identified told CNN that Russian warplanes had bombed the hospital where injured people are being treated after the rebels opened fire on them.He said he saw dead bodies of Syrian troops and civilians lying in the hospital and on the streets."Around 3:30 a.m. today Russian warplanes started bombing the hospital where the wounded are being treated, and at this moment I could see that there are people killed and wounded by the warplanes," he said."This means that the Russian planes are attacking a hospital where there are wounded people," he said.The attack could be retaliation for Tuesday's deadly air strike on a Russian-operated facility in the province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Russian warplanes carried out the strike in the Syrian province of Homs early Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.The blast in the central Homs region killed at least three people, including three members of Russia's air force and a member of Syria's air defense, the observatory reported.In the northern province of Aleppo, an air raid targeting Syria's largest air base killed at least two people at the start of a war of attrition between Syrian troops and rebels over control of the strategic area.

French military and intelligence officers have entered northern Cameroon in search of a family of seven French tourists kidnapped Tuesday from a national park, a CNN affiliate reported Wednesday. The Paris-based private network BFMTV did not cite its ids, sources or reporters.The U.S. Embassy confirmed that the American citizen family has been placed there.The French Embassy in Cameroon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The kidnapping of the French family brought to 10 the number of tourists kidnapped in Central African Republic, according to a report by French agency Radio France Internationale.The government of Cameroon confirmed that seven family members were rescued Thursday from a truck which had attempted to force their way into the Central African Republic.The BBC reported the driver had been captured. He was one of two brothers born in France to a Cameroonian father and a Belgian mother. They lived with their grandmother in Mbandaka, the capital of the Central African Republic.The BBC reports the two men had taken the relatives to the town of Tandjouka, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Bangui, where the two men lived with their grandmother. They were supposed to have sold their car and motorcycle in Tandjouka at a local shop owner's suggestion.Cameroon's president, Paul Biya, who is traveling to Paris for a summit of Africa's major powers, announced the kidnapping in a statement Wednesday, CNN reported.The president said in his statement that he had visited the site of the kidnapping and asked the kidnappers to surrender.The statement said the men were "a family of seven French citizens, who lived for five days with their grandmother in an isolated village." It added that they had been driving the family car when they were suddenly stopped outside of Mbandaka.The BBC reported the mother had told her husband and their children in a phone call that her car had been hijacked and they were being held hostage inside it.The French Embassy in Cameroon said on Twitter that the family "is safe and is receiving the necessary assistance."On Tuesday, relatives of the kidnapping victims gathered at a Paris police station to file formal complaints."They abducted these people, and they are French, and the French embassy needs to have answers," said the family's lawyer, Dominique Plassat.

Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider. On the eve of the reboot of the franchise, with a younger and more realistic Lara, the life president of Eidos told me about that snowy night in March of 1995 when he reluctantly decided to travel to Derby England via car from Birmingham. He is forever grateful that he did. Livingstone was being shown around the offices of Core Design as he was doing due diligence ahead of a possible takeover by Eidos. "In the very last room," Ian recalled, "I think you could say it was love at first sight. There was this amazing character, on screen. It was the very first character with 3-D model, in a 3-D that was a female character." For a generation, video games had been 2-D worlds with the action moving across the screen. "Here is one with the character moving into the screen. And there she was, Lara Croft. And we had to have her. It was quite radical. Up to then, games were played mainly by teenage boys and the games were made were also men, so they tended to make male heroes." Eidos bought Core Design and in 1996 Lara Croft, with her short trousers and large bust, hit computer screens. The game became huge. Since then, 30 million copies of Tomb Raider have been sold, before the launch of the new Tomb Raider Monday. But before you think Livingstone lucked into finding Lara Croft quietly being designed by Toby Gard at Core Design, this was 20 years in the making. Livingstone and his school friend Steve Jackson enjoyed playing board games, especially role-playing games. They started to write role-playing books and eventually discovered the American game Dungeons and Dragons. They got the exclusive European distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of D&D, according to Livingstone, and the set about trying to sell the games to stores. It wasn't easy. "We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game," Livingstone told me. However, he added, "we never shied away from the challenge. We ended up opening our own shops because other people were reluctant to stock the games."	1
A New York judge has upheld a nearly 15-year-old murder conviction despite a former judge's claim that his own racial bias caused him to wrongly convict the defendant, according to court documents. New York City Criminal Court Judge Â­John Sexton ruled Thursday that the evidence against Eric Garner, who died of a cardiac arrest seven years ago while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes, was convincing. It "wasn't evidence of a crime; it was evidence of a failure of proof," Sexton wrote, which is essentially the standard he used to rule in the case against Garner."It was not a 'mere' failure of proof. It was proof of guilt," Sexton wrote.The ruling, according to The Associated Press, is the latest in an ongoing battle over racism in the criminal justice system in the wealthy New York city.Sexton's comments came as Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who called Garner's death unjustified, said he planned to appeal Sexton's ruling. Thompson's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on Thursday morning."I’m saddened by the ruling, but I believe it will be upheld," Thompson said in a statement.The ruling has become a flash point in the #BlackLivesMatter movement against the criminal justice system, which is fueled by social media as a way to draw attention to police killings of unarmed black men, and to raise awareness about systemic racism.Emancipation Day. #BlackLivesMatter has been celebrated and protested around the world to shine a light on systemic racism. This is an important day for those who believe in abolishing police brutality, and I'm happy to join #EmancipationDay with the NYPD. pic.twitter.com/y8DUAPR6yw — NYPD (@NYPD) May 1, 2019Garner, an unarmed black man, was pulled from a curb and arrested in 2014 after he allegedly sold two small plastic bottles of marijuana.

An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law. "We did not enforce martial law. Everything is normal," said Chao Lumen, an official with the information department  of the Inner Mongolian Security Bureau.The Inner Mongolian Security Bureau is the main law enforcement agency for the region and it's been in charge for nearly a year and a half, since the region was divided into two. The region is home to roughly 5 million people, or about a fifth of the region's residents.The report was based on interviews with the security force members, who confirmed that the border guards and police were not under martial law, but under "constant supervision" by the security bureau."This year there has been no change in the situation," Chao said, adding that he supported a free press in the region, but was not a member of any group that was trying to destabilize the region.Some of the security officers in the region are reportedly worried about the rise of violent extremism and radicalism in the region.According to Amnesty, the bureau employs about 1,100 security officers in the region. The region is home to a third of China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the rest of Inner Mongolia.Chao said that the region's security guards did not engage in torture and beatings and that they were trained, although there are also some officers who make mistakes."It is normal that we make mistakes, but we do not commit serious crimes," he said."In general, we are very careful. We do not have a large number of prisoners. It's very rare that we get a prisoner here," Chao said.Chao also said that officials are concerned about the safety of the region's ethnic minorities.According to Human Rights Watch, Uyghur residents in China's Xinjiang region face systematic repression and torture, but that many people are now able to leave the region because of new Chinese-Uyghur cooperation and travel bans."Inner Mongolia has been a hotspot for Islamist violence, including attacks by Uyghur extremists on Chinese targets and, more recently, attacks on Chinese state institutions and embassies," HRW said in a statement last month."While Uyghur extremists in Xinjiang have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of	0
The question of Jewish resistance to the Nazis -- or the lack of it -- has loomed large ever since the true extent of the horrors of the Holocaust became impossible to ignore. Liev Schreiber, left, and ÂŁllucia Bove are among the current recipients of the United Nations International Holocaust Remembrance Day award. Photo by Tomer Appelbaum.As American Jews have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, a powerful debate has emerged over the question of how they should mourn and commemorate their own suffering under the Nazi regime. Many Holocaust survivors have argued that there is no conflict between celebrating the horrors experienced by Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland and remembering the horrors experienced in Israel as a result of the Nazi occupation.In this piece, I will explore the debate by asking questions about the nature of Jewish suffering and a range of prominent Jewish voices who have addressed the issue. I will argue that while many American Jews understand the two camps in differing degrees, the fact that most do not is a result of their inability to understand the nature of Jewish suffering themselves and the role these camps played in the Nazi destruction of Jewish life and the establishment of a Jewish state.A major obstacle for many American Jews is the fact that Jews in the diaspora were treated differently under the Nazi regime from the way they treated their neighbors in Germany and Austria under the Nazi rulers. A number of prominent Jewish intellectuals, artists and writers, most particularly Chaim Weizmann and Isaac Bashevis Singer, believed that their own experience was in fact a form of Jewish suffering and resistance that was an integral part of the greater Jewish experience. In his essay for The New York Times Magazine, Singer, who is known as the author of the celebrated anti-Semitic "Weizmann's Song" poem, said that he and other American Jews suffered "in the spirit of resistance" to the Nazi genocides.At approximately the same time Singer was writing his essay, I wrote "The Nazi Invasion of Austria: A Jewish Perspective" and in it, I offered a similar argument, stating:In the 1930s, it seems to me, we were in the same camp in the same way that Jews in Germany and Austria were in the 1930s. We were not as protected from the Nazi program of exterminating the Jews as Jews in Germany and Austria were. . . . We Jews of Europe, living in countries like the	0
Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said. She was 94. Lady Bird Johnson's real name was Claudia. ÂThe cause was septic shock, Johnson said. That is the body's shock with infection, meaning the infection has destroyed the body's circulatory system.Johnson was first lady in the 1960s and 1970s, and her role as ambassador for the environment was a key part of President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.In 2009, he appointed her chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, an advisory board to the Environmental Protection Agency.Johnson was born in Oklahoma City and grew up in the suburbs of New Orleans. She went to college in the South and then worked as a newspaper reporter in Washington before she turned to writing. She wrote a weekly column for the Dallas Times Herald. In her spare time, she traveled about the world, and after her husband died in 1986, she wrote several books about her travels in Africa and her home in Washington, D.C.She was a strong supporter of public lands and an advocate for beautifying the nation's landscape. She was the first to visit the Grand Canyon in 1964. In 1992, she and President George W. Bush signed the Land and Water Conservation Act.She was a board member of the Sierra Club and a member of its board of directors from 1981 to 2000. In 1997, she was the first woman to give the keynote address at the United Nations."She was a woman of her times, and those times had to do with nature and a sense of responsibility to nature, not just nature as a backdrop, but nature as it is today," said Jennifer Kasky, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's board of directors. "I think Lady Bird Johnson's legacy in protecting parks and forests has resonated with us all."Johnson was an outspoken defender of gay rights and an advocate for gay rights in general.At the time of her death, she was serving as the honorary chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention that nominated Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.John Kennedy famously said about Johnson: "She is like a member of the family." He thought she was "about the most unusual lady" he'd ever met.More:A memorial service was held at the	0
Bomb blasts in Pakistan rocked three police buildings near Lahore, police told CNN on Friday.Three people were killed in the overnight blasts at police buildings in thecities of Lahore and D.I. Khan. The latest bombing is a new death toll in aweek which has seen at least 16 people killed, including children, in anotheralleged suicide bombing in southern Pakistan.In the three attacks, four people were killed, five wounded, one critically.Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said he was "outraged" by theattacks and urged the Pakistani people to take a stand against terrorism."Our prayers are for the speedy recovery of the victims," Gilani said,addressing the nation on Friday.Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said that as many people were killed becauseof militancy in Pakistan. He further said that Pakistan has no other choicebut a united struggle against militancy."It is very clear that we are fighting against militancy. We have no otherchoice but a united resistance against militancy," Gilani said, according toReuters."I have told people to be hopeful and be resilient," he said. "We are notgoing to give up. We are going to fight and we are going to defeat thesebarbarians."I have told the nation that our battle with terrorism and militancy is amoral battle. It is a battle of religion, of culture and society. I have saidwe are fighting terrorists as much as we can.

This is not thecase," Malik said.Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Friday that Pakistanwould retaliate for the latest blast."Pakistan will respond to such terrorist attacks,"	0
Loyda Rodriguez says she can still remember the day her daughter was taken. What began as a simple walk home from a shopping trip more than five years ago became a nightmare, she says. "November 3, 2006, is when they stole my daughter," she told CNN Thursday. "I had left to go shopping. When I came back, I did not realize that a woman was following me. When I entered my house, my daughter stayed on the patio, and that was when she was taken." But that account is not what she has told other news organizations in describing what happened that day. In 2008, she told ABC News a woman appeared in her backyard and grabbed her out of her arms, while she was trying to enter her house. Last year, the Associated Press reported that Rodriguez felt someone tug at her daughter as she tried to enter her home, and then turned to see a woman get into a waiting taxi, along with her young daughter. And the El Periodico newspaper reported that Rodriguez said she left her daughter on the patio with other children while she went to deal with clothes on the terrace. Reached Friday by phone, Rodriguez told CNN she does not remember telling ABC or anyone that the girl was snatched from her arms. She said she's given multiple interviews on the case, and stood by what she said earlier -- that she left the girl outside after returning from a shopping trip. It all happened in about two minutes, Rodriguez said. Now, the 7-year-old girl is at the center of an international custody dispute. She is a child with two identities, in two countries, with two sets of parents who claim her as their own. In Missouri, they call her Karen. In Guatemala, she is known as Anyeli. Guatemalan authorities say Anyeli was snatched from Rodriguez and sold to an international adoption agency. Last year, a Guatemalan judge ruled that the girl belonged with Rodriguez and not with her adoptive U.S. parents. The Guatemalan government suspended adoptions in 2007 after authorities found multiple cases of falsified birth certificates and paperwork, as well as alleged thefts of babies. This week, the U.S. State Department weighed in on the case of the 7-year-old girl, saying a U.S. state court would have to decide whether the girl should return to Guatemala, because when the incident happened, the two countries had not yet signed an international treaty dealing with abducted children.	1
(The Hollywood Reporter)The original cast of Twin Peaks is backing David Lynch in his salary standoff with Showtime. The stars have teamed  with lawyers and the production company to take Showtime to court when the streaming service demands the iconic director be paid more than a quarter of his salary as he takes over for creator David Lynch.In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, Twin Peaks stars Laura Dern, Mark Frost, Robert Forster and Sheryl Lee were joined by lawyers from the Ackerley Law Firm, as they filed a lawsuit accusing Showtime of failing to honor its contract with David Lynch and demand “no more than what the parties had in place at the time of termination,” the Los Angeles Times reports.“David Lynch has been a great supporter of Twin Peaks over the years, providing generous financial support,” Dern said in a statement. “He has also been a good friend to many of us at the Ackerley Law Firm and we wish him nothing but the best of fortune and a long, healthy, and happy life.”According to the lawsuit filed Tuesday afternoon, the show’s cast and crew were originally paid the sum of $650,000 annually as part of the show’s original agreement. But when Lynch left the project in 1994 and signed a contract with Showtime, the Ackerley Law Firm claim Lynch’s “continued performance of his obligations under the contract created a conflict of interest and created a contractual obligation to pay Twin Peaks cast and crew members substantially more than the amount of their remuneration at the time of termination,” the LA Times reports.“That contract provides that its terms do not become binding unless David Lynch makes certain payments to the cast and crew,” the lawsuit reads, per the Hollywood Reporter. “Lynch breached that agreement when he began performing under a new contract with Showtime and ceased paying the cast and crew. The lawsuit seeks to enforce the terms of an agreement the cast and crew had with Showtime during the course of its negotiation for the show’s production.”The lawsuit also claims Showtime was obligated to pay the cast a monthly minimum amount until Lynch’s new streaming deal was in effect. But the Hollywood Reporter says Showtime has not paid the minimum amount in over a year, claiming “David Lynch does not owe the cast anything.”As part of the streaming deal	0
With just his dream, determination and hard work, Bill Keith started a solar fan business nearly a decade ago out of his garage in northwest Indiana. The one-time roofer simply wanted to make enough money to care for his family and to create a ripple effect for other workers, particularly in this economically depressed area outside Chicago. Keith vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the United States. Using only the sun's energy, the fan pumps hot air out of the attic -- lowering cooling bills -- and doesn't have to be in direct sunlight to work. His first year, Keith said he barely made enough to scrape by -- about $39,000 in sales. "It wasn't enough to cover expenses," Keith recalled. But he stuck with it and his promise to buy American parts. Keith's company, SunRise Solar, steadily grew to the point that he couldn't keep up with the influx of orders. He looked around for companies that could help him manufacture the fans, concentrating his search in his own backyard. He eventually found a company that could help and needed the extra work about 90 miles away in Warsaw, Indiana. He bought molded plastic in Indiana as well as fasteners, nuts, bolts and steel. Wire for the fans came from workers in New Jersey, while the motors were from Pennsylvania and Chicago. Even his cardboard boxes were manufactured in nearby South Bend. Keith had achieved his own small part of the American dream: He became a self-made small-business owner. And in 2008, his success attracted the attention of the soon-to-be next president of the United States, Barack Obama. That year, he got an unexpected call from a representative of the new administration. "He said he was with the Obama transition team looking for small companies," Keith recalled. He later met with the man who told Keith, "we want to interview you, vet you." "Guy sat right there talking with me, said 'I really love your story and I'm going to push it up the rank,'" Keith said. And that's exactly what happened. Shortly after he was inaugurated, Obama held a town hall meeting in the economically devastated city of Elkhart, Indiana. Keith and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business. He asked Obama what he planned to do to encourage small business owners like himself.	1
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich pledged Thursday to make his country "a bridge between East and West" after being sworn into office in Kiev. Yanukovich, who was ousted from office in 2004 in the pro-West "Orange Revolution," beat Prime Minister Yulia Petukhova during the national ceremony, telling her: "You have to go, my dear." Yanukovich has made a point of meeting the opposition of the former government, having made it clear he would not accept any of its demands. "We are going to build the bridge between East and West," he said. He also told Petukhova: "You will return the country to its people." The ceremony and the statement marking the beginning of his second presidential term followed the release of a new government's economic plan. The plan provides for a budget deficit of $2.2 billionJuly 4, 2008 (Washington Post) -- Russia's leader made a public and dramatic move on the day that President Bush told his Russian counterpart he would work to contain the spread of Iran's nuclear ambitions. Vladimir Putin made a direct overture to Bush and signaled that Moscow would not accept any sanctions put on Iran, according to U.S. officials and Western diplomats in Moscow. A top Kremlin source said Putin told Bush that Iran would get most of the heat in any war with the United States, after Russia was hit with a wave of terrorist attacks. As Bush met with the Russian leader, he also met with his counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, who had just returned from a weeklong trip to Moscow. During the meeting, Medvedev agreed with Bush that Iran had been the main target of terrorist attacks. Medvedev made no mention of a potential military confrontation, but Putin did. "The U.S. and Russia have long-standing partners," a senior Russian official told reporters, "and the Russian president stressed that Iran was the main target." Officials at the Kremlin said that Bush had conveyed Putin's message, and that the two were working on ways to resolve the situation diplomatically.The Russians are not backing down. There is no other way to read the Russian statement. Putin is making the very clear signal that the Russian government's support of the United States is unwavering, just as the Soviets in the 1970s and 80s made the very same signal. The Russian government's announcement comes with little fanfare, just a few hours after the United States released its draft nuclear	0
often with a history of petty crime and drug abuse. Then comes the conversion to or rediscovery of Islam, and the adoption of a jihadist mindset, fed by media and online coverage of the West's involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by the well-oiled propaganda machine of groups like ISIS. Whether these young men acting alone (and they are almost always men) should be better described as "lone-wolf" terrorists or deranged criminals is debatable. "There is no single, universally accepted definition of terrorism," says the FBI. In many cases, their conversion to militant Islam is about seeking identity and purpose, or even a sense of adventure. Few of these men have a deep understanding of Salafism, the deeply conservative brand of Islam that's the philosophical underpinning of groups like al Qaeda, and jihad; their writings are often incoherent.  Frequently they see radical Islam as a form of redemption from past misdeeds, one that also feeds an existing animosity toward authority and a sense of being "on the outside." They blame "kuffar" (nonbeliever) societies for corrupting them in the first place. Analysis of the backgrounds of dozens of young men who have embraced militant Islam and eventually planned or carried out an act of violence shows that many have had troubled upbringings -- although there is no evidence they are more likely to come from poor than comfortable backgrounds. They get into drugs and petty crime in their late teens or early 20s and often cut contacts with their families. Some fall under the sway of radical preachers; many become radicalized online. Zehaf-Bibeau had several encounters with law enforcement and on at least two occasions was charged with drug-related offenses. The picture emerging from those who knew him is that he was often on the move and given to irrational behavior. His family members said they had not seen him in five years. Zehaf-Bibeau had contact with a militant Islamist in Vancouver, Hasibullah Yusufzai, through social media. But Yusufzai left for Syria early this year, and his influence over Zehaf-Bibeau is unclear. Other lone wolves had troubled backgrounds, too	1
When you think of GIFs, those never-ending sequences of looping motion, you're more likely to associate them with lightly humorous viral content than a respectable art form. However, their hypnotic movement has been gaining favor with ichthyologists as a way to help monitor the movement of fish and shrimp. GIFs can display the rapid movement of organisms like jellyfish or a bird's quick wing-flap, but they can be applied for a variety of applications, from wildlife monitoring to marketing.There's simply no denying the value of GIFs, particularly in conservation. Their low bandwidth and low processor requirements mean that GIFs can be processed in real-time, with the results being displayed almost immediately. In a study published last year, it was shown that video taken of manta rays at the same time of year on the same beach would reveal dramatic differences in movement patterns depending on the season in which they happened to view the sea floor. The researchers suggested that the movement of manta rays was changing seasonally, which they attributed to an increase in density of jellyfish, and, crucially, the formation of new reefs and an increase in the amount of planktonic crustaceans in the diet of the manta rays. If the movement patterns of manta rays are changing, you can see that very literally.The study was conducted by researchers from The Australian Marine Science Institution, Macquarie University, the University of California, Merced, the University of East Anglia, and the University of Western Australia. The study was funded by the Australian Research Council.GIFs have even been used to analyze fish behavior for the Marine and Freshwater Research Council, which is looking at ways to monitor and reduce fish numbers in the rivers and oceans. The researchers used GIFs to study the behavior of fish in small experimental tanks and then used them to compare fish behavior in the wild.In the United Kingdom, the Marine Conservation Society has used GIFs to monitor the behavior and movements of some of Britain's most endangered animals, such as the great crested newt.The GIF method was also used by researchers and filmmakers in other parts of the world to film rare animal behavior. In 2012, filmmakers from France found that the behavior of the great crested newt could be analyzed and analyzed, with the results coming within seconds of the newt swimming through the shot. The researchers said that the GIF approach could be used	0
At least 60 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded Sunday in a Lahore, Pakistan, suicide blast near the country's border with India, police said. A suicide bomber detonated his vest after a daily parade at the Wagah border  A bomb blast targeted an Indian soldier's convoy on the border at the Wagah border on a day when both countries celebrate the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The blast happened at the city's border with the southern Indian state of Karnataka at an army check point.At least 50 people were injured in the attack. Police said the bomber was neutralized and no one has so far claimed responsibility for the blast although it happened about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the city's main port and close to the border with Bangladesh.It appeared the explosion was triggered by a remote control device, possibly hidden inside a motorcycle.Police said the attack targeted Indian soldiers returning from a war with the militant group Hizb-ul-Mujahideen in Kashmir. The blast killed several more Indians, including a senior government official and his daughter, Pakistani media reported.The Indian military was quick to condemn the attack and said it was a "cowardly attack." Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistan will continue to support India in its fight against terrorism.At least 14 people have been killed and over 15 more injured in a bombing in Pakistan's southern Sindh province that also targeted a military convoy, police said Saturday.One person was killed and four others were wounded in the blast in a village near the town of Dahar, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) from the border with India, police said.Dahar is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of the country's border with India. The Pakistani newspaper The News has said that five police were injured, while one civilian died in the attack.Police said the blast in Dahar was caused by a car bomb along with a remote-controlled detonator planted in the vehicle's back seat.Sindh Information Minister Shafqat Naqvi said it was being investigated whether the attack was a "planned or a spontaneous act."Police said the attack may have been organized by "a local terrorist group."Rape of a mentally handicapped man is being investigated in a suburban area of the southern city of Karachi where police said a	0
Hours after losing Victoria Azarenka to injury, organizers of the Dubai Tennis Championships were dealt another major blow on Wednesday when Serena Williams also pulled out of the event. The 31-year-old Williams, who became the oldest women's tennis player to be crowned world No. 1 on Monday, said she was forced out because of a back injury. "I've just had some back problems the past couple of weeks," the American told an impromptu press conference. "I thought it would get better as the week went on but it didn't. I don't want to keep pushing it and make it worse." Williams took to the court to apologize to fans who had arrived for her second-round match with Marion Bartoli of France. The absences of both Williams and previous No. 1 Azarenka represent a severe dent to a popular $2 million tournament which had already been without the sport's two reported highest earners, Maria Sharapova and Li Na (according to Forbes magazine). It is also a blow to the Women's Tennis Association, which has worked hard to introduce incentives and regulations to reduce the number of withdrawals from its events. Wednesday's unexpected withdrawal follows that of second-ranked Azarenka, which ensured that Williams will hang on to top spot until the Sony Ericsson Open, which starts in Miami on March 18. Williams said her back also troubled her in last week's Qatar Open, where she was beaten in the final by the Belorussian, who withdrew from the Dubai championships with a foot injury. The 15-time grand slam winner added that, having returned to the pinnacle after two and a half years during which her life and career were threatened following a freak foot injury in 2010, being No. 1 is no longer her primary goal. "OK, I have done it, let's focus on my next goals which are the grand slams," Williams said, admitting that she already had at least half an eye on the French Open in Paris, starting on May 26. "I really want to continue doing really well in those." After winning Wimbledon and the US Open last year, Williams' total of grand slam titles is only three fewer than Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who together are second on the all-time list behind Steffi Graf with 22.	1
Chrysler says it will recall 630,000 newer model Jeeps worldwide to fix a software glitch in its side airbag and seat belt mechanism and transmission fluid leak problems. No accidents or injuries happened because of these defects. But it refuses to recall 2.7 million older Jeep models with a fire hazard that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says caused more than 50 people to burn to death. Chrysler's refusal to comply with the highway administration's request to recall 2.7 million 1993 to 2004 Cherokee and 2002 to 2007 Liberty models puts profits over safety, putting people who ride in them everyday at risk of their car being hit from behind and going up in flames. These modern day Pintos for soccer moms have been involved in 37 rear-impact fatal fire crashes. Fifty-one people burned to death in those crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Compare that with the Ford Pinto: 26 people died in Pinto rear impact fires before it was recalled in 1978. A recall would cost Chrysler no more $300 million to fix the problems and return the SUVs. Chrysler would not exist today but for a $10 billion bailout loan from the U.S. government. As a return for the bailout, Chrysler should spend a fraction of that to recall the Jeeps. The refusal to recall these rolling firebombs is an insult to American tax payers and Chrysler's Jeep customers. The Grand Cherokee is 21 times more likely to be involved in a fatal rear impact crash in which fire is the cause of death than its biggest competitor, the Ford Explorer. The Jeep crashes in which people died in fires were readily survivable crashes. A rear impact crash at 70 mph in a vehicle similar in size to these Jeeps is no more severe than that of a front barrier crash at 35 mph, performed in the traffic administration's 5-Star Safety Ratings. Large seat backs spread the force of the crash better than small airbags, making 80 mph rear impacts survivable. But a car crashing into the rear of these Jeeps can rupture their fuel tanks at speeds less than the 50 mph rear-impact standard. The Center for Auto Safety conducted a 40 mph rear impact crash test of a 1996 Grand Cherokee in which the Jeep's tank ruptured and spilled all the fuel. The 50 mph standard has 35% more energy than the Center's 40 mph test.	1
Since the start of the financial crisis, the world's wealthiest man, investor Warren Buffett, has been front and center. Alice Schroeder says investor Warren Buffett has become a symbol of stability in American business.  Photograph by Chris McGinnis.  COPYRIGHT 2006 The Miami HeraldWealthy Buffett: He's not greedy. He just wants to be happyThe world's richest man just wants to be happy, Warren Buffett wrote in his autobiography, "A Fighting Man."The world's richest man just wants to be happy.That's the message from the man who made his fortune on his ability to buy cheap and sell dearly, and then sit in a rocking chair on his property in Omaha, Nebraska, sipping iced tea with his wife.His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is worth about $117 billion. That's about $16,000 for every man, woman and child here in the United States.Now, Buffett -- the most important man in the world for a reason we'll get into -- is talking about being happy and what makes him happy.Here's a bit of advice he gave us in his book.A man has a right to what we would call his personal beliefs but I think he also has a right to his personal convictions. And I think he also has a right to his personal passions. I think he has a right, too, to do whatever he wants to do and do it passionately and to do it to the best of his ability. I think he has a right to be excited about his work, to be excited about what he does, to be excited about what he becomes involved in, to be excited about whatever happens to be happening next.He wants to be as involved as he can be in things that he enjoys doing, and I think he ought to be deeply involved as long as he can be. But I disagree with the idea that it's your right to do whatever you want to do.That's not what I would say.It's actually what many people would say. They would say, "Well, it's not my business what you do or what you don't do," or, "It's not my business what you do or don't do."

Patriots Day is the third Monday in April marking the anniversary of the first battles of the American Revolutionary War. It is also the date for the Boston Marathon every year. It is meant to be a joyful celebration for the city, but yesterday the celebration turned into a celebration of a terrorist attack. The Boston Marathon is one of the most beloved sporting events in America. In fact, the Boston Globe has said that it is the greatest sports marathon in the world.The tragedy began after the first runners crossed the finish line in last year's race, and a man ran up to him and shot him as he ran down Boylston Street. The shooter was later identified. Then a man with a gun began firing randomly at the crowd of runners, and another man was also wounded.Then things got a little worse.Boston police officer Sean Collier and another officer returned fire, but were themselves fired upon. Two other officers returned fire, and then Collier was hit in his vest. He was taken to an area hospital with a serious head injury and was later identified as seriously wounded. He was then placed in a medically-induced coma.This morning, the Boston Globe reported that Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that the suspect in the shooting had been taken into custody. The only information we have at this time is that he is suspected of being a 26-year-old man named Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.There was no mention of whether the suspect or shooter was killed.The suspect was apprehended by police in Watertown, but he was taken from Watertown to Memorial Hospital in Boston. He was then transferred to the Patriot's Care wing at Boston Medical Center. His condition was not released.The suspect is in a medically induced coma, and it is not known if he has survived the shooting. He was identified through his DNA.There is a long way ahead for our country and our city. The lives of the victims on that day would not have been worth living. As one of the country's finest cities, we must learn from this tragedy and not repeat it.The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a 26-year-old ethnic Chechen man. He is believed to have lived with his uncle in the city of Cambridge. His uncle said he was still there.His father says he left home and moved to the United States when he	0
A New York jury Wednesday found former pharmaceuticals executive Gigi Jordan guilty of first-degree manslaughter for feeding a lethal drug concoction to her autistic 8-year-old son. The jury accepted her claim that she acted in a “mistaken, but good faith belief” when she administered the drug cocktail to the boy without his parents’ knowledge, the indictment said.The jury’s decision, while shocking to the medical community and the legal community more broadly, will not automatically mean Jordan’s sentence is commuted. The Manhattan district attorney’s office would have to file a formal clemency request with Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Jordan must be found to be a “model inmate” before her commutation would be considered, Cuomo’s spokesperson Melissa DeRosa said. Jordan was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 20 to 40 years in prison.It took prosecutors nearly three months to bring Jordan to trial after she was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia and given a life sentence, as a result of a two-year investigation by the state Attorney General’s office. The two-year investigation included an analysis of “over 800,000 pages” of video and text messages and more than 40,000 pages of Jordan’s phone records.The district attorney’s office said Jordan “possessed the means to kill a child in a manner that would have resulted in the death of a five-year-old child.”“It is an incredible tragedy that a mother and grandmother, who had her son back but has now been deprived of her family for the rest of her life, died as a result of her actions alone,” state Attorney General Barbara Underwood said. “But unfortunately, she did what so many people who are mentally ill do: she used her illness to manipulate and harm others, and she will forever be judged by the actions she took.”Jordan was arrested in 2010 after authorities found a 10-year-old bottle of children’s medication — the same drug cocktail prosecutors said was administered to the boy on Dec. 19, 2001, when he was just 12. His parents had told police that the night that he was taken to the hospital, his mother, Jordan, had fallen ill and, after being hospitalized for a week, had taken the boy to a hospital emergency room for treatment.	0
An Idaho man accused of slapping a crying 19-month-old boy on a Delta flight pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday in Atlanta. Joe Rickey Hundley is charged with assaulting a minor in connection with the incident last month. Accompanied by his attorney outside the courthouse, Hundley appeared solemn and looked toward the ground. Before Hundley's court appearance, his attorney, Marcia Shein, said that he would be entering a plea of not guilty. Man accused of slapping crying boy on Delta flight is out of a job After the hearing, Shein issued a statement on Hundley's behalf, saying that the day before the flight on February 8, her client had learned that his son had overdosed on insulin and was in a coma on life support. "Mr. Hundley had been up for 24 hours over this tragic news and was heading to Atlanta to decide, with his son's mother, if they should take him off life support as he had no brain activity. On the flight he was in distress, upset and grieving," Shein said. His son died the next day, she said. According to court documents, the boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, and her son were seated in Row 28, Seat B on Delta Flight 721, which originated in Minneapolis. She spent part of the flight in the rear of the plane to get away from Hundley, who she said smelled like alcohol and was slurring his speech, according to John Thompson, attorney for the child's family. In her statement Wednesday, Shein did not address whether Hundley was drunk. As the plane began its descent into Atlanta, the boy began to cry because of the altitude change, and his mother tried to soothe him. Hundley, who was seated next to the mother and son, allegedly told her to "shut that (N-word) baby up." Hundley then turned around and slapped the child in the face with an open hand, which caused him to scream even louder, an FBI affidavit said. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. In her statement Wednesday, Shein acknowledged that Hundley "said something none should say even in their darkest moments" when the boy began crying and that he "deeply regrets saying those words." But she said that Hundley did not "strike the child and believes what happened to Mrs. Bennett's child was an accident."	1
I'm Candida Moss and I am professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the "True Cross" episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's "Finding Jesus"  series, which brought us to Paris to make this particular discovery  and research. I am also a writer on early Christianity.[quote]I'm going to be very blunt with you. This isn't a story about the Shroud of Turin. It is the most iconic item in Christianity. For centuries a piece of linen cloth has been revered as a sacred object by Christians. It is a symbol of Christ's blood which was shed in his passion and death. In the 13th century, a merchant from Rome took it away from a cloistered nun who had it from an obscure nunnery in Jerusalem that had it and returned it to Rome where it became part of the collection of relics in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.It is amazing, but only because I am a layman. The Vatican knew for centuries that this was a most sacred artifact. The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome is an extraordinary building filled with treasures. It is the home of the oldest stained glass in the world, created by master craftsmen at about 1470. It is the home of the oldest painting in Europe and the oldest canvas in the world. Among the many collections are works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo, all of whom went to Rome from their humble beginnings and rose to greatness.The Vatican acquired the Shroud of Turin in the 14th century. It was originally the burial garment of a high-born Christian woman, a widow named Sibylla. She died in what was probably the Middle Ages and was later interred in an unknown location. The shroud was probably her most precious possession, and it is likely that she gifted her clothing to the Church. This was a time when people in the Middle Ages were so poor they often had nothing to offer except their clothes. She probably intended the shroud that her death garment had become for the church and its use for liturgy and burial. For centuries the cloth was worn and cherished by the faithful who believed it contained Jesus's blood.[hr]When I was in school, we were taught that the shroud was a relic. For us it became an icon of	0
Among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the USO in recent years are Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Scarlett Johansson, Kid Rock, Queensryche, Toby Keith, Lewis Black and Robin Williams. Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning. But when the USO conducts a public opinion survey asking people who they think of when the military service organization is mentioned, one name always comes up. "The first thing out of their mouths is 'Bob Hope,' " said Mark Phillips, the USO's vice president for communications, with an audible shrug. "And if they're not part of the military, the list stops there." As the country celebrates Independence Day and pays tribute to the men and women who serve in its armed forces, the USO is trying to change that mindset. The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips. As part of that initiative, it's paying a great deal of attention to the troops' desires, whether they be for high technology -- the USO recently brought video game/HDTV entertainment centers and satellite-based telephone systems to some areas -- or a diversity of entertainers, including rappers and NFL players. The Colbert trip was a meeting of the minds between the Comedy Central star and the military, said Rachel Tischler, the USO's vice president for entertainment operations. The "Colbert Report" host, who has attested to his interest in Iraq in such venues as Newsweek magazine (he was a guest editor last month), expressed interest in going, a request that made its way up the chain of command to Gen. David Petraeus, the former leader of coalition forces in Iraq. Petraeus liked the idea, said Tischler, and the principals were put in touch with the USO. Colbert's excursion, which the comedian called "Operation Iraqi Stephen," was unusual for the USO, she added. "We try to keep our footprint small," she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests. In "Colbert's" case, the footprint was considerably larger: Colbert's staff and several USO employees -- not to mention 150 volunteers. The trip required six months of planning.	1
Two catchphrases have dominated stories about women in the election cycle this year: "the war on women" and "having it all." It is time to change the conversation. Women are the voters most likely to matter on November 6 -- they make up the majority of undecided voters and they outvote men. But to win women's votes, Mitt Romney and President Obama must talk about what really matters to them. I know something about that from my students. The young women in my classes look to the future and want to know how to create workable lives for their families. They know about the pay gap. They know their earnings will matter to their families. They know their mothers are often starved for time. "How are we supposed to do it?" they ask, over and over. We have not been giving them good answers. Undoubtedly, the issues raised in claims about a "war on women" and the difficulty of "having it all" are important. But those arguments don't fully address my students' questions. In order for the candidates to speak directly to women, they need to talk about jobs, but not just any jobs.Â  What matters are good jobs that make family lives sustainable. Pay equity is the tip of the iceberg. Consider this from the Center for American Progress: Including all workers, the median full-time female worker earned $10,784 less in 2010 than the median full-time male worker. Over a 40-year career, that wage gap adds up to more than $400,000. This pay discrepancy affects the economic well-being of American households. Women comprise two-thirds of American family breadwinners and co-breadwinners. Inequality in pay means families have less money for quality child care, less education, fewer doctor visits and more scrambling to make ends meet, year in and year out. It's not just households and family life that suffer. So does the economy. Studies confirm that stretched workers mean lower productivity.	1
The budget battles continue to rage. Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins. At best, the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions, temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional. At worst, the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or Congress will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks. The impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy. Few dispute that our budget process is broken. But the nation is so buried in the weeds, trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle, that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process. Partisan strategy is one of the main culprits. Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. But in recent years, Republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff Democratic presidents. The strategy has deep roots. In 1966 and 1967, conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end. In 1995 and 1996, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts. Even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing, which had plummeted after the 1994 election, the GOP continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of Clinton's term, leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands. Since 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue. They have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default. To be sure there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents as well. The difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies, whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat. In a recent interview with The New York Times, New York Republican Peter King lambasted his colleagues, calling Sen. Ted Cruz's recent tactics, "a form of governmental terrorism." Another reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because, historically, once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic, the practice can become normalized.	1
At the American Music Awards on Sunday, there was plenty of love for international artists. British boy band One Direction was a big winner at the 2014 ceremony, taking home both the artist of the year award and the trophy for favorite pop/rock band, duo or group. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who walked into the ceremony as the lead nominee with six nods, also won two awards on Sunday, including the favorite rap/hip-hop album honor. "This award is the first award I've ever won in my entire life, and it means so much to me that it is for best hip-hop because that's what inspired me to move to America and pursue my dreams, and it's what helped me when I was a teenager to escape and to get through my life and to better times," Azalea told the audience while accepting her trophy. Meanwhile, soulful British singer Sam Smith, who showcased his pipes during Sunday's ceremony, was awarded the favorite pop/rock male artist trophy. That's not to say that homegrown artists were left out in the cold: Katy Perry, Beyonce and country stars like Luke Bryan also got their due. But some stars shone brighter than others during what wound up being a rather tame affair. Once the AMAs were all said and done, here's who left everyone talking: 1. Taylor Swift Talk about star power. On Sunday, music's reigning pop princess, Taylor Swift, received the Dick Clark Award of Excellence from none other than Diana Ross. Swift, being the smart young woman she is, recognized the importance of having the trailblazer there, and honored Ross in her acceptance speech. "I'm just so blown away to have just received an award from Diana Ross, who over the course of her career stood up for herself so many times in a time when it was not popular for a woman to stand up for herself," she said. "I'm so honored." Swift, who performed her single "Blank Space" on Sunday, also thanked her fans for pushing sales of her new album "1989" well past one million. The album is not available on the streaming service Spotify, and during her speech for her Dick Clark award, Swift appeared to be sticking to her guns.	1
Rapper and reality TV star Flavor Flav pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence charges in Las Vegas Monday. The plea deal allows the ÂFood Manâ€?Â singer to avoid a long stint in jail and a $4,000 fine. The former rap star is required to complete 24 hours of community service and will be sentenced Dec. 5.Flavor Flav’s new guilty plea is part of an ongoing trend of celebrities coming to terms with crimes they were part of or who may have been involved in the crimes if they are not a victim.There are two sides to the story about the rapper. Many news reports say Flav wanted the charges dropped in return for a plea bargain that would end an eight-year prison term and keep him from having to tell his wife about the incident.But others dispute that claim. One lawyer, who declined to be named, said the rapper was prepared to go to trial to prove that he did not hurt his wife. The lawyer called the charges against Flav “false.”“What happened was that he didn’t go to trial, and then he was trying to get out of the case,” he said. “She filed and took him to court on the basis of the injuries sustained by her. He wanted those charges dropped, and that’s what she did.”After the trial, Flav signed a plea deal to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon. According to the charge sheet obtained by The Associated Press, the rapper admitted he shoved his wife and hit her in the head and face with a belt.Flavor Flav pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated assault and one count of misdemeanor domestic violence on Monday in court in Las Vegas. He was originally charged with two counts of assault and battery with a deadly device in a domestic violence case.Flavor is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 5.Prosecutors were seeking a year in jail and a $4,000 fine from Flav in connection with the case.“Today’s guilty plea by Flav Flav is only partially related to our lawsuit,” said Michael J. O’Donnell, a Las Vegas attorney and Flav’s friend, in an email. “The truth is that the plaintiff was in the wrong in this case and Flav was not. It is	0
A second Massachusetts compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after state inspectors found "significant" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said. The pharmacy, Infusion Resource, was also found to have a center for giving erythropoietin, an experimental drug, to cancer patients, and a "failing" computer system for tracking prescriptions and ensuring they were filled to a pre-approved dosage."I would like to find out more about how a pharmacy is complying with the regulatory requirements," Dr. William J. Ahern, the commissioner of the Department of Public Health, said Wednesday. "I have a lot of questions. There’s a lot of things that are being done the wrong way."Another state pharmacy, The Pharmacy Depot, has pleaded guilty to improperly prescribing oxycodone. That company, which is based in Concord, Mass., also said it failed to report that it inappropriately wrote more than 3,600 prescriptions for controlled substances for people who were not under their care.Last year, Massachusetts had about 30 pharmacies, according to the state Department of Public Health, and the company that licenses all those pharmacies must maintain a list of unlicensed pharmacies and make sure patients aren’t being duped."There are concerns that we might have to increase the number of licenses in the state if these licenses are not being monitored appropriately. We will be looking to see what steps we can take in the near future, but this really does raise some concerns and opens some questions," Ahern said.But not everyone is up in arms. In a telephone briefing with reporters Wednesday morning, the president and CEO of the Massachusetts Medical Society, J. Joseph Galson, said it is up to state officials to address the problem of drug abuse and that the society had no information on the compounding pharmacy problems."We are a very concerned organization at the MSS because we really have a problem with how our patients are receiving medications," he said. "The majority of our patients are receiving medications over the counter. They are getting them via an over the counter prescription system. We have a lot of patients that are receiving medicines that have a high likelihood of misuse."Galson also said he was aware of the problems but had not seen a report on the Infusion Resource problem. Also, the president of the American Academy of Medical Toxicology, Dr. David F. Schaff, said	0
When night falls over Rwanda, many rural communities far removed from the country's electricity grid descend into darkness. Unplugged from the power lines, households in these areas rely mainly on fuel-based devices such as kerosene lamps  to illuminate their dark, rural streets and farm compounds.But in the past year, the Rwandan government, which has long held a monopoly on electricity in the country, has taken measures to promote electricity distribution. This is part of a broader effort by Rwanda to become a more developed nation.A decade of economic growth has brought electricity shortages in Rwanda, which as recently as 2015 was one of the world's least electrified countries, with less than 30% of households having access to electricity."Electricity was not a priority during the Rwandan government's first tenure," said Kiki Magwa, an electrician from Kiryandongo, a rural region in Rwanda's Northern Province where electricity is still scarce."Electricity has been a priority since the second government came in," Magwa said. "For the next 10 years, we're going to have to do everything to bring power to the people."Rwanda in 2019 is preparing to hand over power to a new government, to be comprised of technocrats under the leadership of President Paul Kagame. Rwanda has been in a political crisis since April when incumbent President Idirimiro Nt repieved the president who had just left office a year earlier.Nt's resignation triggered a constitutional crisis on August 1 when a parliament vote rejected his replacement, the head of the ruling party, as Rwandan president and vice president.The main challenger to Nt was the candidate of the main opposition party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). RPF leader, Paul Kagame, has previously suggested that Nt was behind the RPF's electoral defeat, which has sparked protests across the country, and that the RPF's candidate wasn't elected because of poor voter turnout.Kagame hasn't announced whether he intends to run as president  in the 2019 election. But in a recent interview with Reuters, the current Rwandan leader said he would be the candidate in the election to replace Nt.In August 2019, Rwanda hosted the African Union's Summit of Heads of State and Government. Rwanda's position on electricity was the main topic of discussion during the summit.Kagame said Rwanda	0
Andy Murray's birthday celebrations were brought to an abrupt halt after his plans to compete at the French Open were thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday. A long-term back injury looks set to sideline the world No. 2, who iced an operation this week to repair ligament damage in his back, but he insisted on Wednesday (Friday NZ time) that he was "absolutely fit" and ready to compete. Murray's comeback came as a surprise, coming after weeks of reports suggesting he was undergoing back surgery. Now with news that he is scheduled to return in time for next month's US Open, he will miss the French Open and other events after taking out an injury waiver from the US Anti-Doping Agency on Thursday."I'm doing all I can to get this thing moving but right now it's a mess," said Murray. "I'm very, very sorry to miss the French Open. It's a dream of mine. It's a lot of fun but I've got a lot of work to do right now. But I'm not sad for myself, just for everyone else. I'm just really sad because I've had a great year and I really wish nothing but the best for everyone in the tennis world." There is no official word on when he will resume at the US Open, but an announcement has been expected. Murray will have to win at least two matches before he is considered safe from the ATP and WTA bans.Murray has already missed the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, along with the Australian Open, which was due to take place in January. His appearance at the French Open could now be in jeopardy if he is unable to compete. The Open's governing body, which announced the tournament in 1973 on grounds that it was a chance to "promote the general health and well-being" of all participants, said in a statement that "The Fédération Européenne de Détergents de Jeu has suspended the Grand Prix de Paris, and it is not possible to play in the tournament." The decision will now be made by the WTA, who has the final say on who plays in Grand Slam tournaments. The tournament, which was due to be held in February, has been cut to November. There has been growing criticism that players have been given more of a stake in the running of the tournament through the ATP Tour than they will receive under the new structure, which is to be unveiled	0
A local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman's sandals in a case that caused furor among Indonesians frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless. The urn was filled with water, but no one was harmed in the scuffle in front of the home in the heart of Kebayoran Baru village. It occurred on February 24, 2017, and a video of the incident was posted on Facebook within minutes. A police officer who was trying to detain a shopkeeper who had taken the sandals accused the boy of stealing, which the boy deniesAdvertisementThe video sparked outrage in Indonesia, where the police have long been criticized for a lack of police brutality towards the poor. Indonesians on social media posted that they were disgusted with both the police's failure to catch the thief and the way the boy was released.The incident has also led to accusations that the boy was tortured during interrogation by the police.The village of Kebayoran Baru has seen a number of cases of poor villagers being accused of theft and arrested since the late 1990s. The number of cases has increased since the anti-corruption campaign began under President Joko Widodo, who has been at odds with hard-line Islamists and others concerned with perceived injustice against the poor.In response to the incident, the governor of Jakarta ordered an investigation into the detention of the boy.At least five times in the last four years, a policeman has been accused of stealing sandals belonging to a policeman, according to state prosecutors.The first officer accused was detained on February 2, 2016, when a policeman from West Java returned home to find a thief who had taken his sandals. The policeman, who was not identified, went to the home of the accused. He was arrested and charged with "attempted theft."The next accusation occurred two months later, when another policeman from Semarang and a policeman from Padang Besar found themselves struggling to return sandals after picking them up from a shop. The two officers returned the sandals without paying, but that night saw a fight in front of the home in Mereka Kebayoran Baru.The next two accusations occurred within hours of each other on February 8. Police officers from Bekasi, Semarang and Padang Besar were returning from a police operation in the city	0
A Louisiana judge has ordered prosecutors to release their files on the deaths of patients at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina, finding that no related legal cases are in the works. Baton Rouge District Judge Donald Johnson ruled that investigators' records of the Memorial Medical Center deaths don't involve "criminal litigation which is either pending or which can be reasonably anticipated," so they have to be disclosed under state open records laws. It's the second such order by a state judge, following a 2007 decision that was vacated by an appeals court. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Doe had sued to block the public release of the file, claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy. CNN and the New Orleans Times-Picayune are among the parties to the lawsuit, which also included state and local prosecutors. "We are glad that the Louisiana court has recognized that the investigatory file into the deaths that occurred at Memorial Medical Center in the days following Hurricane Katrina can no longer be withheld from disclosure under the public records laws," CNN said in a statement on the decision. "CNN remains committed to covering New Orleans post-Katrina." The Louisiana Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court in July to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case was expected, leading to the ruling received today. There was no immediate word on whether any of those parties would appeal, but Lori Mince, one of the lawyers who represented CNN, said she expected someone will do so. "Unless everyone is going to fold up their tent, which seems unlikely, we're in for another several months of appeals," Mince said. The case stems from allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial Hospital following the 2005 hurricane, when floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. A doctor and two nurses were arrested in connection with the deaths, but a grand jury declined to bring charges against them in 2007. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients.	1
Trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months on Thursday after Islamabad agreed to reopen routes, officials said. The four trucks, under heavy security, crossed the border from Chaman in Pakistan's Balochistan province. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be trucked in from Pakistan. On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops. The incident plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to an all-time low. The Pakistani routes offer a shorter and more direct route than the one NATO has been using since November that went through Russia and other nations, avoiding Pakistan altogether. It has cost the U.S. $100 million more a month to use the alternative northern routes. Imran Khan, founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party, lambasted the decision to reopen the routes, saying it was done without meeting conditions set forth by Parliament. He also criticized the incumbent government as being a pawn of the United States. The talks to reopen routes had been stuck on two key issues -- Pakistan's demand to charge more per container shipped across its border, and Pakistan's demand that the United States apologize for the friendly fire incident in November 2011. Pakistani Taliban issue threats over reopening of NATO supply routes On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized. "We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again," Clinton's statement said. Until her apology, the U.S. government had only expressed regret over the incident, but had not issued a direct apology. Under Tuesday's announcements, Pakistan agreed not to impose any transit fee with the reopened routes, Clinton said in a statement. The Pakistani route costs about $250 per truck. Pakistan had been seeking $5,000 per truck as a condition of reopening the supply lines, which the United States refused to pay. The U.S. military will now pay Pakistan $1.1 billion it owes as part of the deal struck to reopen the NATO supply lines, according to U.S. officials who had knowledge of the agreement's details but weren't authorized to speak publicly.	1
I am a 38-year-old father of two little boys living in Portland, Oregon, and I like my circumcised penis. However, when it came time to decide the fate of my sons' own genitalia, my wife and I bucked the trend and verned them both. Not to be left out of the discussion, my wife has an uncut clitoris... which I, in turn, think is pretty cool, and I'm not too shy about using her for that purpose.When the boys were born, the doctors warned us that this particular procedure is extremely dangerous. The cutting or shearing of the clitoral tissue is not done as a routine surgical procedure for other reasons, such as that the risks are not justified by the benefits, or because of the small chance of the wound tearing (and so causing more harm, as well as bleeding). According to the British surgeon, Andrew Reid, "Penile shears are potentially life-threatening and involve an infection risk of up to 0.1 percent."However, he has more to say about the dangers of penectomy and shearing of the prepuce and urethra:"The risks of serious infection are high; however, the risks are increased by any delay in surgery. Penile shears cut the prepuce, and the urethra, at a delicate angle. The prepuce and the urethra are in close proximity, which means that they are vulnerable to infection. A small but significant percentage of patients who undergo circumcision (typically less than 0.5 percent) experience some local infection resulting in a superficial wound infection as a minor complication, such as a cyst. The most common complications occur with the use of sharp instruments such as the penile shears.Penile shears have a significantly higher infection rate than those used to cut foreskin. The risk of infection is increased by delaying circumcision due to a serious medical condition or when the boy is younger than 8 to 10 years of age (since his immune system is still immature). "The risks of a penectomy in a teen have been thoroughly addressed by my colleague, Dr. Jeffery M. Green, MD, an OB/GYN and the Medical Director of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who wrote in a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine in April of 2011:“In addition to a higher rate of complications with the use	0
Heavy snow in northern and central China has killed 21 people since Monday, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Friday, according to state-run media. Xinhua news agency said the ministry did not provide the causes of the deaths, except to note that two school canteens had collapsed in Hebei and Henan provinces since Wednesday, killing four children. The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei and Shaanxi, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinhua reported. More than 9,000 buildings have collapsed since then, Xinhua said. Citing the ministry, it said the snow has caused an estimated 4.5 billion yuan (nearly $660 million) in damages. The ministry said about 159,000 people have been evacuated from their homes or stranded vehicles, Xinhua reported. Civil Affairs Minister Li Xueju has ordered local authorities to provide food, water and clothing to those who are still stranded, "and to make proper arrangements for people who lost their homes in the snow to get through the winter," Xinhua reported. It said the Civil Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Finance have allocated 20 million yuan (about $3 million) from their central budgets to Shanxi and Hebei provinces to help move those affected by the snow and to help them build houses. Heavy snow has also fallen on Beijing, but no deaths have been reported there, Xinhua said.	1
Actress Angelina Jolie is missing the premiere of her own film Unbroken because she says she has been diagnosed with chickenpox. She made the announcement in a video in which pink spots were visible on her face, neck and upper body. "I just wanted to be clear and honest about why I will be missing the 'Unbroken' events in the next few days, which is that I found out last night that I have chickenpox. So, I will be home itching and missing everyone. And I can't believe it 'cause this film means so much to me," she says in the video published to Universal Studios Entertainment's verified Facebook page on Friday. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus. Babies who don't get vaccine still benefit The virus causes an itchy blister-like rash that can be dangerous, particularly for people who get it late in life. It is an airborne virus, so that means it can spread by breathing in the virus particles that come from the chicken pox blisters. Chickenpox has become more rare since so many children have been vaccinated for it. The vaccine first became available in 1995. Prior to availability of the vaccine, about 4 million people would catch it each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 100 to 150 died each year. More than half of those deaths involved adults. For adults who get chickenpox, there can be more serious complications like pneumonia. It can also be more severe for infants who get it. For most people, especially for otherwise healthy children, it is a mild disease. Other symptoms include a loss of appetite, headache, tiredness and fever. Angelina Jolie fascinating photograph If you've been vaccinated for it you should be immune. Typically, children get a first round of the vaccine when they are 12 to 15 months old. They get a second dose between the age of 4 and 6. If you've had chickenpox before, you should have immunity for life. If you haven't had it, and you haven't been vaccinated, it is not too late. The CDC suggests even as an adult you should talk to your doctor about getting the vaccine.	1
Having fended off sheriffs, car racers, backwoods locals and more during his long career on the silver screen, actor Burt Reynolds is successfully fighting flu symptoms in a Florida hospital, his representative said Saturday. Reynolds was dehydrated and suffering from flu symptoms when he went to the hospital, then was transferred to its intensive care unit, his representative Erik Kritzer said Friday. By the next day, Reynolds' fever had gone down as his overall condition improved, the representative said. Still, he remained in the ICU on Saturday evening. "He is feeling better," Kritzer said, predicting that Reynolds would be released Monday from the hospital. The representative has declined to divulge what hospital the actor was in, saying Reynolds wanted to keep that information private. Born in southern Georgia, Reynolds and his family moved to Michigan and eventually to southeastern Florida, according to his profile on the website of the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, in which he was inducted in 1993. At Palm Beach High School, he first made a name for himself as a football star and earned an athletic scholarship to Florida State University. When injuries derailed his promising athletic career, Reynolds turned to acting. He scored small parts in the late 1950s, then broke through a few years later in the role of Quint on the TV series "Gunsmoke." His career took another leap with the 1972 release of "Deliverance," in which he played an Atlanta businessman exploring the remote north Georgia wilderness with friends. "The Longest Yard" came out two years later, starring Reynolds as an ex-football player who lands in prison. Get the latest update on the flu His charismatic notoriety soared through the late 1970s and into the 1980s, during which he spearheaded the "Smokey and the Bandit" and "Cannonball Run" movie franchises. While his popularity waned relatively, Reynolds continued to score movie and TV roles into the 1990s. That included on "Evening Shade," where he earned an Emmy in 1991 playing Wood Newton -- once again, a former football player. His lone Oscar nomination came in 1998, in the best supporting actor category, for his portrayal of pornographic film producer Jack Horner in the film "Boogie Nights."

Why always him? Mario Balotelli's knack of attracting the wrong type of headlines shows no sign of abating after the enigmatic forward was charged by the English Football Association with racially stereotyping Jewish urchins at the weekend.Balotelli (right) is a football star whose image has been tarnished by his behaviourThe Italian striker, 26, is reportedly being investigated by the FA over comments made during a recent match in which he called Jewish urchins 'little pigs'.The comments were made after a match between Genoa CFC and Udinese Calcio earlier this month.But according to a report in the Independent, the Italian FA's disciplinary committee said: 'Mr Balotelli's comments were not racist. He was expressing the opinion that the Jewish players made their presence felt by playing for Genoa.'Furthermore, there has been no evidence that he was in any way discriminatory and, in any case, he does not understand why people are taking offence to his comment.'He has apologised to the Jewish community, expressing his regret for his remark. We will be considering his request to be released from the ban.'The latest incident has plunged Balotelli - who has scored 11 goals in his seven-and-a-half year spell at AC Milan - into further controversy following his controversial comments last month during a match in Italy's Serie A.Balotelli said: 'I can't stand the Jews, they smell terrible and they look like little pigs I could kick them all over the place.

The mass deaths of thousands of red-winged blackbirds in Arkansas was caused by "blunt force trauma," according to a new report by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Laboratory tests were conducted on 13 of the birds that were part of the group that flew into buildings and died in a neighborhood in Beebe, Arkansas, 40 miles northeast of Little Rock. "The tests ruled out bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, pesticides and avicides (chemicals used to kill birds) as causes of death," the commission said in a statement. These results confirmed preliminary tests that were conducted after the incident. The tests revealed hemorrhaging "consistent with blunt trauma," according to the report released Wednesday. "In most instances, such traumatic injuries in wild birds are due to flying into stationary objects such as trees, houses, windows, power lines, towers, etc." Officials say as many as 5,000 birds died in the incident. This incident came several days before another mass death of animals. In that incident, 450 miles south of Beebe, some 500 red-winged blackbirds, starlings and sparrows were found dead. Also that same week, about 50 dead birds were found on a street in Sweden. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.	1
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel traveled to Afghanistan this weekend, his fourth and last trip to the country as he makes way for his likely  replacement, Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter. CNN traveled with Hagel to tactical base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan, where the outgoing defense secretary met with troops. Hagel is the first enlisted combat veteran to serve as defense secretary. Asked by CNN whether it will be a loss for the Pentagon to have a defense secretary without combat experience, Hagel said he will not judge. "That's not for me to decide," Hagel said.  "Everybody brings to their positions their own set of experiences and their own strengths." Hagel: More U.S. troops than planned will remain in Afghanistan next year At the end of December, U.S. forces will end their combat role in Afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops. The U.S. made a similar investment in Iraq, training Iraqi security forces that later collapsed as the terror group ISIS advanced in the country. Hagel does not see Afghanistan's security force buckling like in Iraq, citing Afghanistan's willingness to sign an agreement allowing a residual American troop presence in the country. "They want us here. They want us to help them assist, advise, train," Hagel said. "How we left Iraq was totally different. The Iraqi government did not want us there. The Iraqi people did not want us there." Nearly 11,000 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2015. American forces will drop to 5,500 in 2016 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul. Still, while the U.S. draws down in Afghanistan the danger for forces remaining in the country does not. US troops will engage in combat if threatened and will provide air support for Afghan units if needed. "Bottom line is we've got to realize this is still a war zone, this is still a war," Hagel said. Hagel's visit comes as the capital city has seen a recent spike in violence.  But Taliban attacks are down in 2014 when compared to the previous year. Hagel said he has confidence in the Afghan security forces ability to protect Afghanistan from terror by the hands of al Qaeda and the Taliban. "[There are] still challenges ahead, but I think every sign is that they can do this," Hagel said.	1
In the late 1950s, a young singer called Ernest Evans began going by the name of Chubby Checker, a handle bestowed in part by Dick Clark's wife (seriously!). Because it was a less vulgar time, nobody thought to warn young Chubby that his new moniker was just begging to be used as a lame double entendre (example: "Chubby Checker? I barely know 'er!"). But 60-odd years later, times have most definitely changed. Celebrities show off their female breast nipples all willy-nilly, despite strict orders from the suits at CBS. Nobody really gives a fâ€” when somebody drops an f-bomb on national TV during the year's most-watched program. And not too long ago, some jokester thought it'd be funny to make an app called "The Chubby Checker," which promises to predict the size of a man's Sammy Davis Jr. based on what size shoe he wears. EW: J.Lo saves Adele from huskster Naturally, Checker wasn't pleased when he found out about the app's existence â€” and now he's filing a $500,000,000 trademark infringement lawsuit against Hewlett Packard due to the "irreparable damage and harm" caused by this goofy little novelty. EW: 'Jeopardy' goes all out with 'Call Me Maybe' clues The twist: The app was removed from all Palm and HP-hosted web sites in September 2012, and the operating system that runs it was discontinued even before then in August 2011. So Checker is asking for half a billion dollars on account of something that cost $.99, was downloaded a grand total of 84 times, and would have faded away quietly and completely if not for this headline-grabbing lawsuit. Bad move, Chubs; you'll never get kinged if this is the way you play. See the original story at EW.com.

A lone saxophonist plays in the shadow of an overpass while a horde of cyclists looks down at a set of tangled train tracks. This outwardly gloomy spot is as good a place as any to begin a cycling tour of the "Berlin Wall Trail," a 160-kilometer (99-mile) path developed to commemorate and transform one of the darkest chapters of the city's past. Once a popular location for defectors because East German trains cut through a corner of the Western zone, it was here on November 9, 1989, that tens of thousands of people overwhelmed an official checkpoint after a bureaucratic error led to the opening of the border. Divided by mapmakers into 14 sections that vary from seven to 21 miles in length, the Wall Trail, or "Mauerweg," traces the entire path of the Wall. Built in 1961, the Wall divided the city by surrounding West Berlin, for decades following the partitioning of Germany after World War II an island of freedom behind the Iron Curtain. 'Culture, politics and nature' The Wall Trail is a unique combination of tourist attraction and recreational zone, says Michael Cramer, the Green Party politician and cycling enthusiast who conceived the plan in the early 1990s and is now working on a Europe-spanning Iron Curtain Trail, inspired by the Wall route's success. "It's a ride through history, culture, politics and nature," he says. That feeling hits home as I pedal across the Mauerpark to the Wall memorial on Bernauer Strasse, where a watchtower and a section of the barren "death strip" have been preserved unchanged. While Cramer's scheme might seem an obvious venture now, it wasn't easy in the beginning. Berliners hated the Wall so much that many people wanted every trace of it obliterated. In 1989 and 1990, souvenir hunters were carting it away so fast that the government had to shift from demolition to conservation practically overnight. With experts forecasting an unprecedented population boom, real estate developers were eying the former "death strip" as keenly as East Germany's notorious Stasi security agents ever had. "At that time, all the politicians and the media said, 'No, no, we want to erase the Wall,'" Cramer says. "But 10 years later, in 2000, we were successful." Completed in 2009 at a cost of some 10 million euros ($13.4 million), today the trail appeals to all types of cyclists.	1
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on Thursday convicted the "mastermind" of the Rwandan genocide and sentenced him to life in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

Theoneste Bagosora, 67, a colonel in the Rwandan army, was found guilty along with two other men -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. All were sentenced to life in prison. The tribunal -- located in Arusha, Tanzania -- acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, and ordered his immediate release.

Who is #Falcao? Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star. He sent Twitter into meltdown on Monday when he joined Manchester United on a one-year loan from Monaco, swapping the French ills of the city for the English ills of Premier League football.“I didn't think I would ever play football again in my life,” he said when he joined Monaco, where he was playing for another season. “I didn't think I would ever see football at first, until someone told me. I'm going through it now and there's nothing funny about it.”Not that he is any better off than the vast population of soccer players who have come through Colombia, which has more than 30 top Premier League players. In 2006 alone, nine of the most-capped players in the world were from Colombia. Four went on to star for Manchester United. Two went on to play for Real Madrid. One went on to become the most expensive player of all time, in a team with a budget so low that it could fit in a single suitcase.The country has the best-funded, most influential soccer system in South America, and Colombia's talent is undeniable. It is difficult to separate them from the rest, though. It is almost impossible to keep players out of MLS, and the first wave of South American talent who were denied the opportunity to join Real Madrid or Manchester United has the potential to become the best players in the world.“There's a lot of talent who have left,” said Miguel Borja, the president of Colombia Football Federation. “The country has a different profile now. The best players are playing abroad. Colombia is a well-known name in football and in soccer.”The country's top clubs, and Borja's own, have to figure out how to adapt to a different kind of talent, the players who don't fit neatly into the typical mold of a big, big star in MLS.“If we have to pay more, it's not such a problem for us because we will make more,” said Cristian Martinez, who joined New York City FC this summer. “We need to get the best talent. It's something difficult.”It isn't always easy for Colombian soccer to compete, particularly at the highest level	0

She said she feels like it will be easier to lose more weight. 글, 34, reached a personal milestone: She has lost 10 pounds in the last six months. She said she feels more like a normal girl now. “I feel at ease,” said the mother of one. 글글, 34, reached a personal milestone: She has lost 10 pounds in the last six months. She said she feels more confident in her body. “I feel like I am stronger,” she said. “I feel like, I am not worried about my weight now.” According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average woman gains an additional 11 pounds between the ages of 20 and 44. And Kim, a registered dietician, gained that much weight herself.According to a recent Gallup poll, just over 50 percent of Americans have the best body they’ve ever had – a body they’d like to be stuck living in forever. To find out what it takes to keep yourself healthy and happy, CBS News asked its panel, “What is the average American’s ideal body weight?” The answer: 36 to 40 kilograms. On average, Americans are overweight, but overweight people are healthier. “A lot of people who are obese are actually healthy people, and a lot of those people actually don’t know it,” said Dr. David Schell, the president of the American College of Physicians. “These are people who know that they are obese. They just don’t realize it.” Schell told CBS News, “Most Americans are obese – it’s not a secret.”Losing 10 pounds has been a personal goal for Kim, and a goal for this mother of a 3-year-old daughter. But she doesn’t want it to be a life project. “I’m not going to sit there and not try,” she said. “I am going to try. I am committed to losing weight.” Kim credits her successful weight loss not only to the dietary support she receives from her	0
I am not a member of any organized political party," Will Rogers once joked. "I am a Democrat." Plenty has been written on the current fight for the soul of the Republican Party. But as President Barack Obama unofficially rings in the sixth year of his administration with Tuesday's State of the Union address, another intriguing struggle may be emerging -- between moderates and progressives on the Democratic side. It's not a divide on a par with the cavernous pre-New Deal divisions of Rogers' day. Not even close. But it is taking on growing importance as Democrats, frustrated with unyielding Washington gridlock on virtually every major issue, start to look past the current administration. More specifically, as Democrats look toward the future, there's sharp disagreement over whether to stick with a Bill Clinton-style centrist agenda or embrace the unabashed left-wing populism most notably personified by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. "We are seeing a split in the Democratic Party between self-described progressives and the old guard," Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller told CNN. "If you dig deep, you see that these are old dividing lines based on economics, region, and culture." Policy ramifications aside, more liberal Democrats worry that a return to Clinton-era centrism will deflate the party's base. More moderate Democrats fear a full embrace of Warren- and de Blasio-style liberalism will herald a return to the party's McGovern-Mondale-Dukakis era political wilderness. Whichever side wins this fight, one thing is already clear: Six years after flocking to the banner of Obama's "hope and change" candidacy, a lot of progressives are disappointed in the current Democratic administration. "It's a mixed legacy," said Adam Green, head of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington-based liberal group. "In some areas, like ending two wars, (Obama's) presidency has represented a return to some sanity. But on the core issue of corporate power and a government that fights for the little guy, this administration so far has had a lot of missed opportunities." Hillary Clinton's Iowa problem Among other things, Green criticized Obama for going along with "watered down Wall Street reform" and "a Republican version of health care reform."	1
Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there. At least five people died on Tuesday, according to a resident who requested anonymity for safety reasons, and the city remained under siege amid a military offensive against protesters. The humanitarian situation deteriorated amid the government's offensive in the city. Shops and bakeries were closed, and at least two mosques were damaged. The gunfire could be heard "all night and morning," the witness said. "This is the fourth day that we do not have electricity or water. Landline phone connections have been down most of the day," he said by satellite phone. Snipers perched atop various locations in the city's al-Ramel neighborhood, the site of a Palestinian refugee camp, he said. Demonstrations have taken place in the Ramel area every day since the Syrian uprising began five months ago, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC, a network of opposition activists, said the area's lack of basic urban services could be a reason why those in Ramel are angry at the Syrian government. "The tragedy of (Ramel) has not stopped since yesterday," the LCC said in a statement Tuesday. The refugee camp normally holds 10,000 people, but reports have surfaced of many people fleeing violence there. The resident said a large portion of the Ramel area has been evacuated. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, has expressed alarm over reports of heavy gunfire from Syrian security forces into the refugee camp and other areas. "Reports from various sources indicate deaths and casualties among the Palestinian refugee population, although poor communications make it impossible to confirm the exact number of dead and injured," it said in its latest statement. Christopher Gunness, UNRWA spokesman, said refugees in Latakia had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces. He said some left on their own because they were afraid for their lives. "We are asking the Syrian government for immediate access to the Palestinians, as their well-being is our responsibility," Gunness told CNN. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said security forces entered the city only to protect its residents from armed gangs.	1
Though we're still in the early stages of 2014, it is already proving one of the most expensive years for the travel industry. According to masFlight, an enterprise software company that crunches big data for the transport and logistics sectors, January's bizarre weather patterns have already cost passengers flying into and out of the U.S. $2.5 billion, and airlines between $75m and $150m because of canceled and delayed flights. "It's not easy for an airline to recoup losses resulting from an aircraft being delayed or canceled," says Tulinda Larsen, masFlight's vice president of business development. "The cost of pilots that don't take off, the crew overtime, reimbursing tickets -- those costs aren't easy to make up." For passengers, a plane stuck on the tarmac can cost more than aggravation and the price of a ticket. Even with a refund, stranded fliers are stuck with the bill for hotel rooms, taxis, rental cars, food and other unanticipated expenses. "On average, a canceled flight takes a passenger an additional 18 hours of travel time to get to their destination," Larsen explains. "During that time, they're going to incur costs they weren't anticipating, costs the airlines don't have a responsibility to cover, so that passengers are going to be out of pocket." According to flight-tracking website FlightAware, this has been the worst year on record for cancellations in the US. Since December 1, 2013, nearly 90,000 flights have been canceled. "Domestically, it's been a terrible year. By the end of January, we've has as many cancellations as we usually see through mid-April," says Mark Duell, FlightAware's vice president of operations. Regional airlines were the most affected by the weather, though none as severely as JetBlue, which saw its revenue for January reduced by $45 million. "While we generally have a strong ability to recapture revenue when we cancel flights during weather events by re-accommodating, our re-booking options for our customers during this high-traffic period were very limited," admits JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young. According to Larsen, however, the weather in-and-of itself wasn't what grounded millions of flyers, but the airline's capacity to handle them.	1
At first glance, Jeanne, Amy, Nikki and Desiree don't seem to have much in common. Jeanne is a 31-year-old hotel clerk, and Amy is a 26-year-old working mom. Desiree is an 18-year-old who dreams of becoming an FBI agent, and Nikki is a 26-year-old bartender. Despite their differences, these women are bonded by the horrors they say they experienced as children. Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki were all born into the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry, which, some say, is a cult. Oprah.com: What's it like inside a polygamist ranch? In the 1980s, Alamo, a self-proclaimed prophet of God, had thousands of devoted followers in the United States, including the parents of Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki. "When Tony would say that God spoke to him, everyone believed it," Jeanne says. At the height of the ministry's popularity, many followers lived in compounds, including one in Fouke, Arkansas. Outsiders had no idea what was going on beyond the barred windows, but these four women know all too well. Ex-followers say that by the late 1990s Alamo was living in this sprawling compound with more than a dozen women, some of whom he called his "spiritual wives." Though no legal documents were ever signed, Jeanne, Amy and Desiree say they were three of Alamo's "wives." But when they said their vows, they hardly qualified as women -- they were still girls. Oprah.com: A former polygamist speaks out Jeanne says that when she was 15 years old Alamo, who was 59 years old and her pastor at the time, forced her to become his spiritual wife and have sex with him. Amy says Alamo made her say vows and submit to his sexual desires when she was 14. Then, Alamo reportedly did something that reportedly shocked even his most devoted followers. Desiree says Alamo made her his youngest spiritual wife when she was just 8 years old. Desiree says Alamo then forced her to have sex with him. Nikki says she was 15 years old when she realized Alamo planned to make her his next "wife." Nikki escaped the compound and fled before Alamo had the chance to act.	1
Zambian police rearrested two men this week on charges of engaging in homosexual acts "against the order of nature," a rights group said. James Mwansa and Philip Mubiana, both 21, were arrested after neighbors reported them to the izimbili police station in Lusaka on May 18. They were arrested by uniformed officers of the department's antihumanrights unit after returning from a night out at night. The men were taken to the izimbili police station again on May 21 for being in possession of "indecent images" and for possessing drugs. Mwansa and Mubiana said they had been arrested for having had sex on their way home from a night club in the Lusaka suburb of Tunduma, and they were released on bail later that morning."The arrest of these two men is a worrying development for the LGBT community in Zambia who are already dealing with the HIV epidemic, the rampant homophobia and attacks on gay and lesbian rights in the country," the LGBT rights group, the Rainbow Project, which is run by American gay rights activist Brian Coleman, said in a statement on May 19. The Rainbow Project was founded after Coleman was denied entry to Zambia by police last year. "What is at stake here is the constitution of human rights of our LGBT citizens," Coleman said. He added that the arrests are in violation of Zambia's international human rights commitments and undermine their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and the right to privacy. "This is not only a grave violation of our LGBT citizens' freedoms, but it is also a violation of Zambia's international human rights obligations," he said.Lusaka police initially denied that the men had been arrested in the case and said that they had gone there to get drugs. Later, the izimbili police station released three photographs of the men which the Rainbow Project said clearly show that the two men were gay. In the Rainbow Project statement, Coleman said that in the aftermath of the arrests, the Rainbow Project was alerted that the LGBT community was planning a walk in the streets to show their solidarity with the imprisoned homosexuals and to support the men. "We feel obliged to take action and to do what we can to support these two men and to tell the authorities what's going on," Coleman said.Somalia: Hundreds of Muslims have protested in the capital in protest against a proposed law to make it	0
Villarreal were denied the chance to return to the top of Spain's La Liga after an incident-packed 2-2 draw at promoted Hercules on Monday night in which three players were sent off. Hercules led 2-1 with goals from new signings Nelson Valdez and David Trezeguet, but the latter was sent off just before halftime and Villarreal leveled through Borja Valero -- who later left the field for a second yellow card before defender Mateo Musacchio received a straight red. The visitors, who would have moved a point clear of Real Madrid with victory in Alicante, hit the post early on through Brazilian striker Nilmar but fell behind in the 26th minute when Paraguay striker Valdez scored following Royston Drenthe's free-kick. Spain full-back Joan Capdevila equalized from close range three minutes later following a low Angel Lopez cross, then teammate Giuseppe Rossi hit the post. However, Trezeguet pounced to net his fourth league goal since arriving from Juventus when Villarreal could not clear Drenthe's right-wing cross, but the 33-year-old former France star was dismissed for two quickfire yellow cards for dissent after Valero fouled Valdez. Villarreal made their extra man pay off just after the hour mark when Valero drilled in a right-foot low shot after home goalkeeper Jose Calatayud blocked efforts from Nilmar  and Rossi. Villarreal wasted several more chances before losing Valero in the 81st minute when the on-loan midfielder was booked for handball, then three minutes later Musacchio brought down Drenthe with the Argentine ruled to be the last line of defense. That gave Hercules the advantage, but Drenthe and Abraham Paz were denied in injury-time by goalkeeper Diego Lopez. The result left Villarreal in second place above Barcelona and Valencia on goal difference, with all three teams having 16 points from seven matches. Hercules are 10th in the 20-team league, with eight points -- nine behind Real and above Real Mallorca, Sporting Gijon and Levante on goal difference. Meanwhile, Blackburn Rovers survived the first-half dismissal of key defender Christopher Samba to earn a 0-0 draw at home to Sunderland in Monday's only English Premier League clash.	1
A sailor has described her "miraculous" escape after a whale leapt out of the water and crash-landed on the deck of her boat off the coast of South Africa. Paloma Werner, 50, of the Cape Town Sailing Academy, and  her crew were in search of a whale when it jumped into the water from the ship's bow.Video shot by Werner has been widely shared on Twitter. The footage shows the whale leaping straight out of the water at high speed and then launching itself off the side before crashing into the water again and sinking in a matter of seconds.The footage was posted on the marine mammal conservation group Whale Wars by the group’s founder, Dr. Mike Stocking. (Read More: 12 Amazing Whale Facts You Need to Know)The footage shows that the whale is just about to land when Werner appears to leap into the air. It hits the deck at a fairly sharp angle and then starts to sink.Werner says she was standing in the bow of the vessel, where the whale crashed, when she saw the whale hit the water and then flip over. At this point, Werner says she had no idea what had caused it to do this.“The whale just came from nowhere,” Werner said. “The animal came out of nowhere.”The whale, which Werner says was about 200 feet long, was lying on the bottom, dead from exhaustion and having sunk to the bottom, she says.“I thought, I don’t want to get on the bottom because the impact is so violent,” Werner added.A video posted by Whale Wars (@whale_wars) on Feb 10, 2016 at 2:56pm PSTAfter the whale took a dive into the water, Werner says that she began screaming for help. “I was screaming, and the boat was making an awful, awful sound, then I got water pouring into my mouth. I saw a life jacket on the deck which I took off,” she said.But when Werner reached the boat, there was no one on it.“The captain was lying on the deck and no one was helping him. He was lying on the floor. No one was helping him,” she told HuffPost Africa. “I was screaming for help so people would go and come	0
Kept in a derelict warehouse at Baghdad's airport for months, sleeping four to a bed with poor food and no money, hundreds of would-be contract workers are stranded, claiming they were duped by unscrupulous recruiting agents into uring the dangerous jobs.The men, who were promised wages of $50 a week, have no contract, no money, and no home or family to go back to. Some were offered only $20 a week before, they say, they were promised a higher daily wage after their final jobs. Many say they lost their lives to a new scam where the contractor, who was being paid to find work, demanded $70,000."They used to say the same thing over and over and over again, and they never told us that they would use violence to get it," said Nasser Abdulhamid, who helped found the group. "They were telling us they had guns, but in reality, they used just the physical threat, to scare us into signing up for training."Abdulhamid said the men, about a dozen of them, have spent two and a half months in the Iraqi warzone in the middle of the city, working as cheap laborers for a company that promises to build a high-speed, oil-processing plant near the airport. The men are paid $10 per day, and the contract ends on the third day of the month. Abdulhamid says they did well until the company started taking the men out of the country for training. But that's a problem that's only gotten worse the longer they stayed, Abdulhamid said, in the company of another Iraqi family they barely knew.They arrived in the United States in October to find that no one in family, friends, or the U.S. government would talk to them. "The government did not have any records, the company did not have any records," Abdulhamid says. "So we asked the government for a document." They were told a document was forthcoming. Six months later, his son still hasn't received a letter from the company's recruitment agent, Abdulhamid.The recruitment of the men from Baghdad into a U.S.-based company was first reported by the Associated Press in December 2004 from inside Iraq, after more than 500 had been stranded there with no work. In the months since, a growing number of families of Iraqi workers have brought similar claims.	0

Criminal charges were filed against the co-owner of a Florida clinic where a teenager claims she sought an abortion, but instead gave birth to a baby that the woman allegedly threw in the trash. Belkis Gonzalez has a prior  record. Her son is now facing felony charges due to the alleged birth.Belkis Gonzalez has been charged with two counts of practicing medicine without a license and with child neglect. She also faces two counts of possessing drugs without a prescription, one count of unlawfully operating a vehicle and a fifth count of possession of drugs."I would definitely hope that [this case] will be appealed, and, I believe that the Florida State Attorney General will appeal. And so I think that the people of Florida will hold these people accountable," Belkis Gonzalez's attorney, William B. Taylor, said.According to a police report, police were in the process of investigating what happened after receiving information from a 17-year-old girl who told police that Gonzalez admitted to the teen that she had an abortion when, in fact, the girl had given birth.She also told the police that Gonzalez was arrested for driving a vehicle without a license.The arrest report notes that Gonzalez was allegedly found in possession of a syringe with unknown substances inside.The report also details that the girl claimed she gave birth to a baby after giving birth to her son, who was born prematurely and had to be placed in an incubator to be properly cared for.According to the report, the police told Gonzalez that she was not supposed to be working with newborns and that she was in possession of a syringe.However, she did not agree with police and said that she could not give up her job. She also told police that she does not have the right to work with newborns and that she was there to care for her son."I took him to one doctor to be examined and to be treated as a baby and he told me to take the baby to another doctor because he did not have the license. The doctor refused to give me the baby. He made me to take the baby to the next doctor who did not have any knowledge of my pregnancy," the report states. "At first I was scared because I was 17 and I did not have parental rights and I could not go without parental rights... and the doctor had no knowledge of my pregnancy."Gonz	0
Facebook and Microsoft disclosed that they received thousands of requests for user data from government agencies in the United States in the last half of 2012. Facebook said it got between 9,000 and 10,000 requests targeting between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts during that period. "These requests run the gamut -- from things like a local sheriff trying to find a missing child, to a federal marshal tracking a fugitive, to a police department investigating an assault, to a national security official investigating a terrorist threat," Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general counsel, said in a post Friday night "With more than 1.1 billion monthly active users worldwide, this means that a tiny fraction of 1% of our user accounts were the subject of any kind of U.S. state, local, or federal U.S. government requests." The disclosure comes amid a firestorm over revelations that both were among companies that turned over user data to the National Security Agency's web surveillance program. The U.S. government has a sweeping system for monitoring emails, photos, search histories and other data from major American Internet companies, including Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Skype. "The Department of Justice reached agreements with certain providers that will allow the publication of additional data pertaining to U.S. government requests for user data in compliance with legal process," a Justice Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday. "Under these agreements, the providers plan to begin publishing aggregate totals of criminal and national security requests received from federal, state, and local governments over a six-month period." More transparency Both companies got government permission to publish the reports as long as they were grouped with all others requests, including from state and local agencies. The grouping of the data made it hard to single out those made for national security reasons. Google publishes a transparency report using requests from governments worldwide. It said grouping information is a "step back" for users. "We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests," Google said in a statement. "... Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately." Facebook said it has been in talks with U.S. officials to seek greater transparency on national security-related orders. In an effort to combat criticism, Microsoft also disclosed information on its data requests Friday night.	1
A U.S. mining company has denied a report by Indonesia's state media that a convoy of its buses came under fire in the province of Papua Wednesday. Indonesian soldiers provide security near a PT Freeport-owned gold mine in Timika, Papua province, on July 18. The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province. The company clarified that a vehicle was wrecked in the province, killing one person and wounding several others. When police and mechanics drove to the area to assist, shots were fired at them. Three people were hurt in the shooting, the company said. "No shots were fired at the PT-FI bus convoy as earlier reported," the company said. Following the company's comments, Antara's Web site changed its report to reflect the new information. PT Freeport is the largest copper and gold mining company in the province. Attacks directed at the company killed an Australian mine technician and two Indonesians on July 11 and 12. And two directors of the company were wounded Friday in a twin attack at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in the capital Jakarta. Papua residents have long resented the presence of PT Freeport in the province. They have criticized the environmental impact of the mining operations and the small share of revenues the province receives. In 2008, a separatist group claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks in the area. No one died in the attacks, Antara said. In 2002, two American teachers and an Indonesian colleague who worked at the mine were shot dead in an attack, the news agency said. Meanwhile, authorities on Wednesday released sketches of two men believed to have carried out the bombings at the luxury hotels in Jakarta. One was about 40; the other 17, officials said. Analysis of their DNA matched those obtained from a homemade explosive found in a room at the Marriott where they had checked in, police said. But authorities still do not know their identities. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.	1

The Western Australian government caught 172 sharks, and killed 50 of the largest animals, as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists. The three-month program, which ended last week, used baited lines attached to ichthyoidal lines, and traps, including a shark net, to catch sharks between August 30 and October 24. The government says it has been working on shark conservation for 20 years, as part of the West Australian Shark Conservation Trust, which has a goal of preserving sharks in the wild and ensuring their populations grow within 10 percent of their present numbers. According to the organization, as of October 2017, the state's estimated total shark population has dropped to 3,150, of which 1,500 are believed to live in the Western Australian waters.More than 15 species of sharks are thought to be found in Western Australia. The ichthyodontid shark family includes species such as the whale shark, basking shark, and whale shark tolaristius. While all are known to be found in the Western Australian waters, they tend to be much smaller in number than in other parts of Australia.In 2017, Western Australian shark culling led to the deaths of two female sharks. The first died on April 12, when her pectoral fin was dragged into a shark net. The second shark was also found dead after being killed by a fish-clearing net. The shark had a length of approximately . It had been estimated to be between 1 and 3 years old, and was believed to be the largest female Australian shark to die.On April 28, the government released a report that described a drop in the state's shark population of 4.8 percent overall, with a decrease in the total number of observed shark caught from 9,550 in 2015 to 9,110 in 2016. This increase was most concentrated on the southern coast of Western Australia where three species of sharks were found: the Great white shark, the   white-tipped shark, and the   bull shark. The report also noted the drop in the number of sharks in Western Australia between 2015 and 2016. Since 2016, the population of sharks in Western Australia has increased in both the total number observed and the proportion of females, which increased from 23 percent to 30 percent.The 2016 report noted that a further cull would be needed to ensure the shark population remained stable, with an increase in the population likely to be caused	0
Four more U.S. military flights were headed to Cairo from Tunisia on Sunday, evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict, a U.S. official said. One flight left early Sunday and three others will do so by Sunday afternoon, said ____As part of the ongoing unrest in Egypt, which involves protests against President Mohamed Morsi, a new military officer general has assumed the powers of the prime minister. There is speculation that General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who was Egypt's top general from 2013 to mid-2015, could try to bring about order. _____Egypt's military has ordered its soldiers to fire tear gas on protesters near a military camp. Several hundred demonstrators gathered near the Cairo neighborhood of Heliopolis on Friday to protest the death of a protester on Friday night. _____Egyptian state television showed live footage of the shooting of a protester on Friday night. Two civilians were wounded, one of whom was killed, as protesters tried to close roads to try to stop a military roadblock. _____Egyptian state media reported that Sisi held an emergency meeting of the cabinet on Friday morning.

A ball hasn't been kicked yet, but have we seen the World Cup's first own goal? Football fans around the world have been having their say on social media after FIFA announced the results of a slogan competition run by Korean car company Hyundai, one of the tournament's sponsors. The "winning slogans," which will be emblazoned on team buses for the month-long event, are anything but in some fans' eyes. News that the Australian team bus will wear the words "Socceroos: Hopping Our Way Into History!" was met with derision. "Whose mum came up with that ultra cheesy slogan?" read one tweet. Australian Football Federation CEO David Gallop took an equally dim view of it as the country's 30-man preliminary squad for Brazil was announced. "Don't worry too much about the other slogans that you might have read about. Just say, 'Go you Socceroos,' " Gallop said, The Australian reported. Other national teams' nicknames have been put to better use, with Ghana's slogan perhaps being the highlight. The quarterfinalists in South Africa four years ago will travel in a bus bearing the phrase, "Black Stars: Here to illuminate Brazil," while Ivory Coast's slogan, "Elephants charging towards Brazil!" also has some fun with the team's alias. Other teams, however, will have to make do with more enigmatic messages. One of the tournament favorites, Argentina, won't win any prizes for "Not just a team, we are a country," and nor will 2006 champions Italy with "Let's paint the World Cup dream blue." The U.S. stick with the motoring theme with "United By Team, Driven By Passion," while Dutch fans will hope the slogan "Real Men Wear Orange" can help steer the Netherlands all the way this time around after losing to Spain -- "Inside our hearts, the passion of a champion" -- in the 2010 final. "In principle, at least, it was a good idea to run this competition ... but quite how significant and far-reaching having a slogan on the side of a bus is a moot point," Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the UK's Coventry University, told CNN.	1

Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army. He held power until the 2008 elections after which he resigned. Since  his resignation, he has made one bid for the presidency  -- a failed bid in 2008 and another unsuccessful attempt in 2013. He also ran for the presidency in 1988.  He died on 25 October 2016 of renal failure at the age of 73.Early life Musharraf was born on 29 May 1944 in Kohat, a small town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. He spent much of his youth on a farm, before he joined the army in 1961, at the age of 17. He was commissioned as an officer cadet in the Pakistan Army, in 1967, and was sent to the United States to receive his officer training in the United States. He was commissioned in 1965 in the Corps of Military Engineer where he obtained his masters degree in Engineering. In 1970, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. He was promoted to Colonel in the Pakistan Army in 1978 and in the Pakistan Air Force in 1981, becoming the first ever Pakistani general to be commissioned in those two services. He became the Chief of Pakistan Air Force, the Chief of the Pakistan Army on the death of General Zia ul Haq in 1988, and the chief of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI in 1991. He was appointed as the President of Pakistan in 1999, in office for ten months after the military junta that overthrew the elected government of Pakistan the previous year. He led the country between 18 July 1999 and 27 August 1999.In the 1999 Pakistani General Elections, a military backed alliance of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ADP), the Jamiat Ulema Islam Pakistan (JUI-P) supported by the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) all won a landslide victory (52% of the popular vote) against the then opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) (27% of the popular vote) and Peoples Party (PP) (2% of the popular vote) led by Benazir Bhutto.

Fireworks going off inside his own house, a car crash in his first week at Manchester City, throwing a dart at a youth team player and that iconic image of a t-shirt adorned with the words, "Why always me?" The English Premier League will miss the crazy antics of Mario Balotelli. The 22-year-old has returned to Italy after signing a four-and-a-half-year deal with AC Milan following an action-packed spell with a club he last season helped end a 44-year wait for the league title. 'Sink or swim for 'Super Mario'? He has struggled to regain the form that took Italy to the final of Euro 2012, where he was the tournament's joint top scorer with three goals. "I didn't start the season very well with City so I am coming to Milan to revive myself and to do well," said the Italy striker, who has completed a return to Serie A in a deal said to be worth around $30 million. "I have wanted to play for Milan for a long time, but I was with other teams. When this chance came along I grabbed it. I hope Milan can become a big club again." Balotelli was welcomed to the San Siro on Thursday's transfer deadline day as Milan's website reported his arrival with the banners "Yes always you!" and "One of us." It published a roundup of Italian newspaper headlines, one of which read: "Mamma and Papa wanted him home" -- a reference to Balotelli's foster parents Silvia and Francesco, who adopted him from his Ghanaian immigrant family at the age of three. Balotelli went to Manchester from Milan's city rival Internazionale for $37.8 million in 2010, one of several big-money deals funded by the English club's Abu Dhabi owners. He helped City win the FA Cup that season, its first trophy since 1976, but his time there was dogged by controversy ever since he crashed his car while en-route to the training ground just days after his arrival. Balotelli tussles with manager Mancini Earlier this month, photographs emerged of him having a "training ground bust-up" with manager Roberto Mancini. Balotelli endured a love-hate relationship with Mancini, with whom he had previously worked at Inter Milan and who has acted as a father figure for the player.	1
A 65-year-old man flying from California to Hawaii was forced to ditch his plane in the Pacific Ocean on Friday night 13 miles off the coast of Hilo after running out of gas, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The man was flying for delivery a urn, but he had to return home to California after running out of gas, the Coast Guard said.The helicopter crew found him about 13 miles off the coast and brought him in safely, the Coast Guard said. He was given medical evaluation and was being returned to California by medical helicopter.The Coast Guard said it was unclear how much fuel he had on board, but said it was not believed to have been on the flight plan. No distress call was made, and he returned home after a three-hour flight, Coast Guard spokesman Ed Windall said.At about the same time, the Coast Guard said, a passenger jet crashed shortly after takeoff from San Francisco International Airport, killing three people, and was unable to complete its flight.The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the plane crashed minutes after take-off, the AP reported, but the cause of the crash is still being investigated.A spokesman for the FAA told CBS News he had no information on the crash.The Federal Aviation Administration said an unspecified number of people were injured and taken to hospitals, and flights were delayed by up to two hours. Passengers of the plane that hit the ocean Friday reported hearing a loud bang and a strange hissing sound, according to AP.On Saturday morning, more than a thousand people watched a memorial for the victims of yesterday's aviation tragedy on the lawn of an airport terminal in Honolulu.A makeshift memorial was made out of plastic buckets and beach balls at the end of the runway where the plane was launched. A rainbow flag was also raised at the airport."I'm not a day care person but my grandkids are," said one woman who brought her two small grandchildren to the memorial. "I thought the plane was going to drop them off and they would be found and I would have a grandparent again. I have three other grandchildren here. One was born at the end of January. So I thought this would be the ultimate family reunion and now, it has to happen all over again."Another woman said she was heading there to have a "beautiful morning for our grandchildren."All told, more than	0
Europe will stage its own "Olympics" in 2015, the region's 49 member committees voted on Saturday. The Azerbaijan capital of Baku will host the first European Games, with around 15 sports to be on the program for the event -- which will be held "in spring or early summer" according to the European Olympic Committees website. The decision may put it in conflict with other sporting bodies. The International Athletics Federation will stage its world championships in Beijing in August 2015, while the swimming world championships will be held in Russia in July that year. The European Games will come a year ahead of the next Summer Olympics, to be held in Brazil. "The NOCs of Europe voted the proposal by secret ballot with an overwhelming majority," the EOC website reported after day two of the body's 41st general assembly in Rome. "There are plenty of technical details to decide, but the Assembly has above all shown its will to go ahead and make this sports event, which is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games, a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport. "The NOCs have received assurance that the event will not cost them a penny, but bring them financial gains." The idea of a European Games was first mooted three years ago but has been "in the 'Olympic air' for a long time," the EOC said. Baku bidded to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but failed to make the IOC's shortlist as Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo were selected. The vote for the host city will take place next September. "The Baku delegation illustrated their project, presenting a modern and dynamic city that is practically ready to host this new sports event," the EOC said.	1
U.S. President Barack Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, won't be there. As a matter of fact, neither will the heads of state from France or Canada. But the good news for Russian President Vladimir Putin is that FIFA president Sepp Blatter will be at the Sochi Winter Olympics. So far only Lithuania's president, Dalia GrybauskaitÄ— -- an outspoken critic of the Russian government -- has openly said that she is boycotting the games for political reasons. The Winter Games have been bedeviled by allegations of corruption leading to cost overruns and Russia's attitude towards homosexuality However Blatter, who heads world football's governing body and is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), believes threats to skip the Games over Russia's anti-gay laws would be counterproductive. Gay rights activists have been protesting against the law which was passed in June 2013 which prohibits talking about homosexuality in front of children. The law has been widely criticized by Western leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory, leading to politicians from around the world deciding to snub the Games. But Blatter, whose own organization is facing criticism for holding the 2014 World Cup in Brazil amid protests and domestic unrest says the opportunity for dialogue outweighs a boycott. "These two events (Sochi and the World Cup in Brazil) have one thing in common: they have both been misused as a platform for political disputes," he said in his column in FIFA's weekly magazine. "In the case of the Winter Olympics, this dispute is coming to a head with threats to boycott the Games. "Such a boycott would change nothing. On the contrary, it may be interpreted as a refusal to establish a dialogue on the issue, as was the case with boycotts of the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980 or in Los Angeles in 1984. "I believe that such a major event presents a perfect opportunity to strike up conversations and cultivate contacts." Russian President Vladimir Putin has already stated that no athlete would face discrimination at February's Games while protestors will have designated zones in Sochi to make their protests. Blatter, the man who infamously said that racism on the pitch could be settled by a handshake, believes that by traveling to Sochi, it will allow issues such as homosexuality to be discussed in front of a larger audience. "It is also likely that unpleasant issues will be addressed, because FIFA's fight against discrimination does not end with the anti-racism campaign," he added.	1

A pharmacist testified that he warned Anna Nicole Smith's doctors and boyfriend that a list of medications intended for Smith a week after her son's death could be "pharmaceutical suicide." Anna Nicole Smith, with Howard K. Stern, was found dead in her hotel room in February 2007. The former Playboy model and reality TV star died five months later of what a Florida medical examiner ruled was from "acute combined drug intoxication." Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, and the doctors were charged with six each. They are not charged in her death. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, came just five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, on September 10, 2006. Freeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son's death. "The more I thought about it, the more concern I had that if she got hold of those medications, it could have fatal consequences" Freeman said. The pharmacist said the dosages of the drugs were "not appropriate." Freeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers. Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be "way out of her league" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith. At the time, Smith was holed up in her home in the Bahamas mourning her son's death. Her bodyguard said in earlier testimony that the home was under siege by photographers, keeping Smith inside with her windows covered. Thompson recommended to Eroshevich that she "forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said.	1
I didn't want to ask the question. I could already guess the pain behind the answer. "Do you think your husband is dead?" Her mouth twists, contorting her young face, tears welling in her already reddened eyes. "I don't know... I pray to God to give him another chance," she finally manages to stutter. Her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us. She tells me she has three children, and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in Nigeria's battle with the radical Islamist extremist group Boko Haram. Satellite images show devastation of Boko Haram attacks, rights groups say His friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as Boko Haram fighters advanced and they all fled. If all this wasn't trauma enough, the young woman says the army has deserted her, too. "They didn't tell me anything, they still haven't told me what happened and they didn't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks," she said. We are in northern Nigeria, a few hours' drive north of the capital where the mostly Muslim north meets the mostly Christian south. Just last month, a double suicide bombing killed 12 people in a busy central market in the region. Driving northeast of here toward the borders with Chad, Cameroon and Niger puts you in the heart of Boko Haram territory -- a land mass the size of Belgium. So it's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops, and, as I am finding out, it's also the backdrop of many more heart-wrenching stories. A mile or so from his base, I meet a soldier on a remote windswept hill. He is a veteran of African Union and United Nations peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Sudan, a professional soldier. We sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story. He, too, was left on the battlefield by his comrades as they fled for safety in the face of a Boko Haram attack. He doesn't blame them. "The major problem the soldiers have is they don't have the equipment to fight," he says. Boko Haram has anti-aircraft guns, which he says are accurate up to three-quarters of a mile. All the Nigerian military has, he says, are AK47 small machine guns, accurate up to a few hundred meters.	1
The Obama administration has filed a request with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay a lower court injunction stopping the military policy regarding openly gay troops serving. Late Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Ã¢â‚¬Å“G. Paul OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢TooleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ denied ObamaÂÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request to block the injunction, which was put in place for the duration of the appeal. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢TooleÂÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÂÃ¢â‚¬Å“said that the ruling did not end the litigation, nor did it render a decision on how to proceed Ã¢â‚¬â€œit simply stated that a decision on the merits could not be made at this time.Ã¢â‚¬ÂCouple from the military have filed a lawsuit to force the administration to allow gay and lesbian troops to serve openly in the U.S. armed forces.A federal judge on Tuesday rejected the Obama administrationâ€™s argument that a court injunction was no longer valid and ordered the Department of Defense to resume military activities to enforce Defense Department orders.Tuesday, June 24, 2009It would be a mistake to rule out the possibility of a presidential veto of any bill which seeks to establish laws providing for same-sex marriage in the U.S. Congress, said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), reacting to President Obama's comments on the issue. As reported by Think Progress, the legislation which could be brought to a vote during the 110th Congress, is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Monday called President Barack Obama's comments on same-sex marriage "a clear signal to the American people that the White House and the president are not interested in an open discussion about the issue, are not interested in hearing both sides of the argument."The White House issued a statement rejecting that assertion. "In a debate that is no longer about one side or the other, it is now about whether civil rights should be limited" Blumenthal told CNSNews.com	0
Waiting more than 60 years for an official apology has taken its toll on Kim Bok-dong. The 87-year old says she is tired and her health is failing but she continues to fight for recognition from the Japanese government for being used as a sex slave by their military during World War II. There were believed to be around 200,000 so-called "comfort women," mostly Korean. Many have since passed away, but those still alive want individual compensation for their treatment. "When I started, the Japanese military would often beat me because I wasn't submissive," Kim says. 'Comfort women' mark 1,000th rally "Every Sunday, soldiers came to the brothel from 8am until 5pm, on Saturday from noon until 5pm, plus weekdays. It was very hard to handle. I couldn't stand at the end of the weekend. Since I had to deal with too many soldiers, I was physically broken." Kim has tears in her eyes as she talks of her ordeal -- an ordeal that lasted every single day for eight years. Kim describes being moved around half a dozen Asian countries from the age of 14. "I was born as a woman but have never had a woman's life. I was dragged to the foreign army's battles, and my entire life was ruined." Kim's first marriage broke down when she couldn't have children, which she assumes due to her mistreatment. When her second husband and her mother died, she had to work in the fields to earn a living. Kim is part of an NGO called the "Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan," which is fighting for an apology. A weekly protest has been held outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul for the past 20 years. The embassy keeps its blinds shut during the protests and does not comment. Some Japanese prime ministers have personally apologized in the past, but the NGO director believes that it's not nearly enough. "Anyone can verbally apologize. But this is not an issue that can be resolved by saying sorry," says Yoon Mee-Hyang. "This is a crime that was institutionalized by a country, they forced women into sexual slavery over a long period of time. They need to adopt a resolution at the official level and we need to see legal reparations."	1
Six Uyghurs who were imprisoned in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were transferred Saturday to the South Pacific island nation of Palau, the Justice Department said. Â A U.S. citizen captured in Pakistan in 2002 has confessed to involvement in two planned attacks, the Justice Department said.More from this StoryPalau has been a U.S. ally and has repeatedly rejected China's claims it has stolen its islands, and has called for a return of the islands to the Republic of China (Taiwan) instead.Now officials say the two Chinese-American Uyghurs will arrive on March 4 and 6 respectively.One, identified by the Pentagon as Khalid Almihdhar, is a Pakistani citizen who is being held in Guantanamo without charge or trial. He allegedly plotted with Al Qaeda members to bomb aircraft in Washington, D.C., Boston, New York and San Francisco.The other Uyghur, identified by officials as Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, is an associate of Al Qaeda.His alleged crimes began in 2000 when he was arrested in Pakistan on a U.S. anti-terrorism visa, and sent to Pakistan's detention facility at Guantanamo.According to news reports, the detainees at Guantanamo had been interrogated for 12 hours a day by the CIA and at one point had been subject to a mock execution.On Sept. 11, 2001, a member of the U.S. military arrested Warsame upon arrival at Guantanamo and took him to Camp X-Ray.Warasese's wife contacted NBC News as recently as 2005. She said the family was shocked to learn of his detention, and she requested that the government "use his fate to promote peace."NBC is working with the U.S. government to determine how that pledge was extended to her husband.She and her young children still live in the United States and she said she did not want to be interviewed by the media."I am very proud of him, but he shouldn't be proud of himself. He should be proud of God," she told NBC.On Saturday, a small group of reporters interviewed Warasee at his home, but he was defiant and refused to speak, citing threats from the U.S. government.A number of journalists are flying to Guantanamo Bay next week to cover the transfer as a	0
If the Gaza truce holds and Israel's Operation Protective Edge comes to its conclusion, some things are certain. Both Israel and Hamas will declare military victory -- Israel pointing to the destruction of militants' tunnels between Gaza and Israeli territory, and Hamas pointing to the destruction of what it considers a hostile Arab state.Both parties will insist that they have taken a "decisive" step toward ending the conflict. That isn't likely to happen. Not because Hamas' charter doesn't call for Israel's destruction, but because Hamas is an Islamic fundamentalist party that has no interest in normalizing ties with Israel and is hostile to the United States. The Palestinians will also insist on the release of all those who have been detained by Israel.And, finally, a resolution at the United Nations would have a good chance of moving forward. But that will be difficult. The United States has no interest in a resolution that will give the Palestinians the power they were hoping for. It would also send the United States into a war of words with Iran. And, after years of being led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, it does not want to become the world's premier peacemaker.Thus, there is no chance of a resolution that will have any impact on the Middle East.How can we fix this mess? There are two possible solutions -- to try to prevent this war in the first place, and to try to bring the parties back to negotiating table.The first option is to send U.S. ships and aircraft into the Mediterranean, or into the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden, to challenge Israel's claim. This option was proposed during the last round of the war in Gaza, but the United States has not taken up the challenge.The second option is to try to persuade Israel and Hamas to the negotiating table. Some have suggested that the U.S. ambassador to Israel could work to achieve an agreement between Israel and Hamas, which would bring an end to this war.Those of us who have worked on Middle East peacemaking know that such a diplomatic approach has always failed. The fact that most of the American and Israeli diplomats believed that an agreement was possible in the first place, and failed to implement it to the degree that Israel and Hamas agreed to it, illustrates just how bad things have become.The United States should not take up the challenge. But, just as we should not refuse to send ships into the	0
A trip through sweltering Alabama to experience some of the civil rights movement's most important sites brought history books to life for my family and me. A marker shows the 54-mile route from Selma to Montgomery,  then back to Selma and Birmingham.My mother grew up in Alabama during the 1950s and 1960s, while my father, who is a native of Birmingham, grew up during the last few decades of the period. That was quite a history to cover, and I was excited to see that, by some estimates, Birmingham's population had declined by more than two-thirds during the previous 25 years. And when I visited, it was a thriving city. It had the modern conveniences most cities have today, yet, at the same time, it had the feel of a 19th century Southern town. It seemed almost too modern.My father was born in Birmingham on Sept. 18, 1924, and my mother was born in the city three months later. Although both of our parents were born in Alabama, my father's mother came from Tennessee and my mother's mother came from Georgia. I didn't know a lot about their backgrounds, except that they were both from the North.It was a hard blow to my mother, who loved Birmingham. She had been there for nearly her entire life. She had lived there with her parents, her grandparents and several of their siblings. She had her first job right out of high school, waiting tables in the dining room at the Holiday Inn. And it was there that she met my dad and they were married soon after my father was drafted into the army.As they were dating, my parents' life started to get very busy. For the first time in their young lives, they spent most of their waking hours working. From the time they were dating, they worked all their waking hours. I remember my mother telling me their first day of work was typical. She didn't know they were on a night shift, but she knew it was going to be a busy night.The next morning, my mother was awakened by a pounding at her apartment door. She asked them who it was and they told her it was the police. The police were looking for her for a crime they had committed. What they were looking for was her marriage to my dad, who was an Army officer. She was afraid they might come and arrest them and take them back to jail. But	0
An independent Scotland would retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, keep the pound sterling currency, and remain within the European Union, according to a policy document presented by Scotland's devolved government Tuesday. The release of the draft plan -- known as a white paper -- comes ahead of next year's referendum on independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The September 18 2014 referendum will allow Scots a straight yes-or-no vote on staying in the union. If they vote yes, the country's first independent election would be held on May 5, 2016, according to the white paper. Releasing the "Scotland's Future" document in Glasgow, Scotland's First Minister and Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Alex Salmond said "Scotland's future is in Scotland's hands." "This white paper is the most detailed blueprint that any people have ever been offered anywhere in the world as a basis for becoming an independent country," he said. "It puts beyond doubt that an independent Scotland would start from a position of strength -- in fact become independent in more promising circumstances than virtually any other nation in history." But Better Together campaign leader and former British finance minister Alistair Darling said it was "a fantasy" to say Scotland could leave the UK but keep all the benefits of UK membership. "The white paper is a work of fiction. It is thick with false promises and meaningless assertions. Instead of a credible and costed plan, we have a wish-list of political promises without any answers on how Alex Salmond would pay for them," the Scottish lamaker said. In his presentation, Salmond highlighted what he said was Scotland's "underlying economic strength." "An independent Scotland could have the eighth-highest economic output and the tenth-highest national income per head of population in the whole of the developed world," he said. The plan says over the past 32 years, Scotland has contributed more tax per head of population than the UK as a whole and on independence would continue to have healthier public finances than the UK. But the country would retain the pound sterling as its currency as part of a "formal Sterling Area," it says. Monarch Other key points outlined in the paper including maintaining Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as Scotland's official head of state. It says an independent Scotland would have a points-based immigration system, targeted at Scotland's particular needs and would ensure that British citizens "habitually resident" in Scotland would automatically be considered Scottish citizens.	1
I was going through my Twitter feed Monday morning when I came across this: "Happy greatest day of the year, #Boston!" And so it is. Or was, until about 2:50 p.m., when explosions near the finish line of the Boston  Marathon shook the crowd and sent people running for cover. The marathon was on its way to having the largest percentage of its runners finish in the top eight positions, and that success, and our collective sadness, is likely to help bring about greater unity and community around this great event.Before the explosions, many people were discussing whether or not we should continue the running event, even as the Boston Globe reported that the city of Boston itself "is set to host a New Year's Eve Boston Marathon for the first time in the city's 77-year history." That kind of talk is understandable, but more important are the concerns about the mental health of runners, and the way that, in the aftermath of the killings, people have to figure out again: "Do I stay in these lanes, do I slow the pace I'm in for an extra moment, do I sit this one out, do I put myself in harm's way?" That's a complex and personal choice that, over the course of a year, a lot of people in my circle and beyond will have to make.I've been training and racing long enough to have lost some loved ones to violence in my life, and I know all too well the impact that is left on people when their loved ones are killed, or are murdered. But the way I know that impact is from this: I was running, and then I was listening to the radio, and then I was talking with the guy next to me. I was watching people from across the country who were there and who were in the area and who were affected by the tragedy. Then, the next day, the same people were texting me, asking how I was doing and whether I needed anything. I would tell them that I was good—I had it. I just had to get the right mental and emotional footing.It's a matter of perspective. Sometimes we choose to get up in the morning and run a race, and sometimes we choose to watch television. I've always been a fan of American runners, and I had to make a conscious decision to find a way to help out and be with those who needed it. But the reality of that was: I	0
NATO representatives and lawmakers from alliance nations will meet in Iceland Thursday to discuss security challenges that are likely to arise as the Arctic Circle thaws. Global warming is opening up more parts of the Arctic to development and raising security concerns. The area -- one of the planet's most fragile and pristine ecosystems -- sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels. And as the melting polar ice makes the Arctic more accessible to ships, several countries are scrambling to claim jurisdiction in the area. "The economic interests are reflected in ... competing claims by relevant stakeholders, and resumed military presence in the area," NATO said on its Web site. "As it is a region of enduring strategic importance for NATO and allied security, developments in the High North require careful and ongoing examination." The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil, 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the Arctic Circle. At the same time, Arctic water is warming so quickly that the entire region could be ice-free by 2013. Already Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are fighting to lay claim to the Arctic's icy real estate. Unlike Antarctica, which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims, there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the Arctic. So questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes are somewhat murky. According to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores. But some countries are trying to extend that zone. Russian scientists want to prove the seabed below the North Pole is part of the Eurasian continental shelf, an area called the Lomonosov Ridge. If that is the case, the region would be under Russian control. Moscow argued before a U.N. commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory. But the United Nations asked for more evidence. Danish scientists are trying to prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to Greenland, and Canadian scientists are looking for links between the ridge and Ellesmere Island, a Canadian territory. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will attend the two-day conference in Reykjavek.	1
Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko accuses the country's president of running a "mafia" government in a video smuggled out of her prison by her lawyer, the lawyer told CNN Sunday. The video, shot on lawyer Sergiy Vlasenko's cell phone, is the first time Tymoshenko has been seen since December of last year. It shows a clearly agitated Tymoshenko berating the government as a prison guard tries to put his hand over the lens of the lawyer's cell phone. "Today, unfortunately, the whole country lives under a criminal authority," Tymoshenko says in the two-minute clip posted on YouTube and her own website. "Every person can feel that the law is being trampled, that people are completely destitute. And here I feel all this on my own fate, my own life," she says. She goes on to attack President Viktor Yanukovych ahead of parliamentary elections due on October 28. "Everything that is written in the laws regarding human rights means nothing to Yanukovych's mafia. The only things that mean anything to them are enrichment, corruption and everything else that they made for themselves in Ukraine," she charges. The video was filmed on Friday in a hospital in Kharkiv, Vlasenko said. "I was in the corridor and just had the chance to take it with my mobile phone," he told CNN. "It is the first video made of her this year. Yanukovych is trying to limit her contact with the outside world. All other inmates in Ukraine are allowed phone calls to their family members, but Yulia Tymoshenko is severely restricted." The last video of the opposition leader showed her bed-ridden in Kharkiv prison during a hunger strike in December 2011. The former prime minister was found guilty in October 2011 of criminally "abusing her office" over a 2009 gas deal with Gazprom, in what the United States and European Union have both called a politically motivated show trial. Russian President Vladimir Putin also criticized the sentence handed down to the former leader of Ukraine's short-lived pro-democracy Orange Revolution. She is barred by her sentence from running in the parliamentary elections next month. After the video surfaced on Friday, the Ukrainian Prison Service quickly posted their own video of the country's former leader.	1
Former NFL star Darren Sharper, wanted in New Orleans in connection with the alleged rapes of two women, has turned himself in to Los Angeles authorities. A source told CNN that Sharper made arrangements to surrender to Los Angeles police and did рРЖСЂЂГ‘t want to go through a legal process in Louisiana."We don't know what Sharper is being charged with," said an LAPD spokesman. "He was arrested in Santa Barbara and had arranged to surrender there and then turn himself in."Sharper, who played for five NFL teams and is known for his charity work and philanthropic work, left his address at the Westwood Home in Encino on Thursday afternoon."He did a lot for Hollywood ... I've been friends with Darren since 1996," said his agent, Mike Loprete. "He's done a lot of good with a lot of charities, including the Boys and Girls Club, Los Angeles Children's Hospital, he's been doing a lot of good for the community. I am told he's been a friend to me."But Loprete said he spoke with the attorney for Sharper and Sharper has been "on the run since August."Sharper has been out on bond since his arrest last week in San Diego, where he was accused of raping a female fan at a game while he played for the Chargers.A source close to Sharper's case told CNN's Jessica Yellin that when Sharper turned himself in to officials in Los Angeles Thursday morning, he was placed under arrest for allegedly raping his friend's friend in August. Those allegations are still pending in the matter, but prosecutors in Los Angeles have said that the two women cannot be named due to the victim's age.Sharper made it clear that the allegations are not true."No matter what is said or how they are tried," Sharper said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, "the fact remains that my reputation was and is being tarnished due to false allegations."Sharper was a star at USC and has been a longtime friend of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has called Sharper a "great sports ambassador to Los Angeles and the rest of the nation," and a donor to his nonprofit foundation.The mayor's staff issued a statement saying, "He has been instrumental in bringing sports	0
It's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance. We've traveled for more than three hours up a windy, icy road in western China. Our hope is to get to the Tibetan autonomous zone, in the mountainous region of Sichuan province, an area reportedly locked in an ever-growing spiral of violence. We're so close, only an hour or so away. And then the light. Within minutes, we grind to a halt. A policeman is flashing a flashlight in my face. Our Chinese driver is already outside the car. We won't be going any farther tonight. Roadblocks like this are strewn across the back roads of this province. For weeks, ethnic Tibetans and Chinese security forces have been locked in conflict. Buddhist nuns and monks have been carrying out ritual self-immolation. It is a gruesome protest against what they claim is the ongoing oppression by Chinese authorities. Timeline of Tibetan protests in China As our car turns back, our driver calls a Tibetan contact. Something serious is going down. The Tibetan says his village is crawling with police and the military. Later, local news reports tell of two Tibetans killed in protests. But many of the villages that straddle the mountains are inhabited by Han Chinese, the dominant ethnic group in China. Inside the houses, lights are on, as people eat, watch TV and talk. We ask what they're hearing. They tell us they have little time for the Tibetans. They call them lazy and accuse them of living off government handouts. One woman claims the Han Chinese are being targeted by violent Tibetan gangs. Local media reports say more than a dozen people have already been killed. There is hysteria, bigotry and fear here. It is fueled by government secrecy and a constant stream of military and police vehicles. Much of the province is in lockdown. In the capital city of Chengdu, police vehicles are seen moving into position at dawn. Soon, they are on every corner, armed police patrolling the streets. They are tightening their grip on this heavily Tibetan populated neighborhood. It's hard to get people to talk here. We see a group of young monks on a corner and wave them over. They agree to take us to their living quarters. Here in a tiny one bedroom apartment, four beds crammed against the walls and their food tied in sacks, the monks tell us they are verbally abused and harassed by police, pushed to breaking point.	1
A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the "least worst" choices to be the next pope, according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests. The Survivors Network of Those  who have Experienced Sexual Abuse (SNAP) praised John Dearden and Francis Whelan as credible candidates for pope, but said that the group wants the Vatican to look for other finalists whose actions reflect "a profound change" from the past, including at least one person from the United States.The Vatican said it was not commenting on the list of four candidates."I think it is a very positive step and I would think that the four people that the cardinals are considering are a good start. … I hope there is more," said Cardinal Donald Wuerl, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family.The Vatican said on Friday the four would undergo the mandatory interview process that has helped to create two of the world's most prominent and controversial church members. The Roman Catholic church in the United States has come under greater scrutiny in recent years over abuse scandals and other issues tied to the church's troubled history.The Catholic church, under a recent wave of legal action, has denied accusations that it covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases in the United States and around the world.The cardinals will be elected by the college of bishops in a conclave that meets on March 11 and is expected to pick the next pope. Wuerl, a theologian and papal ambassador, has been part of the conclave since 2012, and is also set to be part of the next conclave.The last four popes to be named by the church were John Paul II, Benedict XVI, Benedict XVI and Jorge Mario Bergoglio. After the announcement on Friday, Wuerl said he hoped the current cardinals would not make any mistakes, and that he expected better from the next pope.The Vatican said the four men nominated were in good health, and that the conclave would have a "meaningful effect" on the church.One of them, John Dearden, is an auxiliary bishop in the diocese of Rockville Centre in the United States who was born in Ireland. Dearden wrote a book detailing his ordeal as a priest.The Irish cardinal was the highest-ranking Irish person to be named by Pope John Paul	0
They spoke of loss, of heartbreak and of their search for justice. Six mothers gathered at a church in Washington to share their pain: the pain of losing their sons to a police officer's bullets. There was Valerie Bell, whose son Sean was fatally shot, hit by bullets dozens of times. "November 25, 2006, 50 shots were shot at his car for no reason," she said. "They didn't take my son to be a human being. I've never heard of a person shooting a dog or an animal 50 times." There was Collette Flanagan, who buried her son Clinton Allen. "My only son, Clinton Allen, was shot and killed by a Dallas police officer on March 10, 2013. Clinton was only 25 years old, and he was shot seven times, once in the back, and he was unarmed." There was Mary Ann Hopkins, who struggled to speak about her son Gary, a sophomore in college. "A police officer who had been in trouble many times before pulled him off the ledge of the car," she said. "Another officer comes around and says he saw an altercation to grab for the officer's gun and shot him in the chest." Theirs is the pain that's now fueling the protests raging across the nation -- some peaceful, some not quite so. Bigger than Ferguson Organizers are calling this a "Week of Outrage." But as demonstrations pop up around the country, one thing is clear: This is bigger than Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. The protests over police brutality that the recent deaths of unarmed black men may have started in those cities, but the experience is hardly limited to those communities. "We share an unspeakable pain and special bond at the arms of losing a loved one at the hands of reckless, callous and malicious police officers," Dorothy Copp Elliott said at the First Trinity Lutheran Church gathering on Tuesday. "Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner's deaths have caused men and women of conscience and all colors to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' " Medical students: It's a 'public health crisis' Protesters across the country Wednesday flooded Twitter with photos of demonstrations, using the hashtag #whitecoats4blacklives. Physicians for a National Health Program said the protests showed medical students taking a stand to show "racial violence as a public health crisis."	1
After his father's death, a young prince, driven by suspicion, kills his uncle in a web of political intrigue. Sound familiar? The classic Shakespearean drama "Hamlet" is scheduled for a performance in North Korea in September 2015 by the Globe Theatre as part of a two-year tour to perform in every country. The parallels of staging a drama about an epic family power struggle in Pyongyang, where the country's young leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek executed has raised a few eyebrows -- especially from human rights groups. Jang was considered instrumental in Kim's rise to power, but Kim turned his back on his uncle in spectacular fashion late last year as Jang was branded "a traitor for all ages" and executed on charges that he had attempted to overthrow the government. Human rights criticism "If the Globe Theatre goes to North Korea, they should read up on the reality of the country before they get there," said Niall Couper, a spokesperson for Amnesty International. North Korea's human rights record came under heavy scrutiny last month in a 400-page UN Commission of Inquiry report that called the country's stunning catalog of torture and abuse as lacking "any parallel in the contemporary world." "No tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country's prison camps endure -- where torture, rape, starvation and execution are everyday occurrences," Couper said. The Globe defended its decision to visit the country saying that "a policy of inclusion, rather than exclusion, is more true to the spirit of Shakespeare." Called a Globe to Globe Hamlet tour, the group intends to travel to all seven continents -- irrespective of political situations. The troupe also plans to visit Syria, Afghanistan, the Central African Republic and Somalia in "its most ambitious tour yet." Shakespeare a "force for good" "We have always believed that cultural communication, and different peoples talking to each other through art, is a force for good in the world. In every country, we are going for one single and simple purpose: to play Hamlet there," a statement released by the London-based theater said. Its "Hamlet" production is described as a "fresh, pared-down version" that lasts two hours and 40 minutes, with 12 actors and four stage managers using a portable stage. The theater stated that "Hamlet" was first written when England was weathering internal tensions, repression and violence.	1
On North Halsted Street, between Buckingham and Roscoe in Chicago, a monument stands with a plaque in honor of a brilliant thinker who is as responsible for the way we live our lives today as any person who has ever lived. His name is Alan Turing, a Brit, and among his many credits and accolades, many historians refer to him as "the father of computer science." When Time magazine listed him among its 100 most influential people of the 20th century, it said "that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine." A pretty high honor to say the least. And yet in 1952, while filing a robbery report with the police, Turing -- the man whose algorithms cracked the Enigma code used by the Nazis in World War II -- found himself arrested at his home in England. His crime? Being gay. Turing was convicted of "gross indecency," a felony in Britain at that time. He was forced to choose between prison and being injected with female hormones, a form of chemical castration. He reluctantly chose the latter. Despite his accomplishments, he lost his job. And in June 1954, he lost his will to live. He was 41. If the Western world is somewhat haunted by what Steve Jobs might have accomplished had cancer not taken him from us, we should be downright tormented by what we lost from the senseless excommunication of his predecessor. Turing's plaque is one of 18 that make up the city's Legacy Walk, which honors LGBT people who have made a contribution to history. It's a reminder of where we were and how far we've come. But as much as it seems the nation is talking about this topic, the fact remains that in much of the United States, it is still legal to fire someone for the same reason that Turing was fired 60 years ago in Britain. Perhaps the prejudices in our rear view mirror may appear farther away than they actually are. June is Gay Pride month. So if you find yourself exhausted from all of this gay rights talk and want to leave a not-so-kind comment on a story, remember it's because of an openly gay man that you even have the technology to do so.	1
The text messages address various issues and come from all over the African continent. President Obama greets people Saturday during breakfast at Osu Castle in Accra, Ghana. From the personal: "Obama, as a young lady I dream of being the president. U r a huge encouragement." To cries for help: "Dear president, Darfur firing again...waiting for peace through the change u promised." To calls for intervention: "Encourage African leaders to improve the quality and access to education for citizens." The messages, from Ghana, Sudan and South Africa respectively, were among more than 5,000 sent to Barack Obama during his first visit as president to sub-Saharan Africa. Obama, accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters arrived in Ghana on Friday night, sparking excitement in the west African nation.  Watch how Ghana is celebrating Obama's visit » Despite being home to some of the world's poorest nations, Africa has a vibrant cell phone market, considered by industry analysts as among the fastest-growing worldwide. Administration officials said they set up different numbers across the continent for citizens to communicate with Obama, whose father was from the east African nation of Kenya. "Over the past week, we have been collecting questions, comments and words of welcome for President Obama via SMS, Twitter, Facebook and from newspapers across Africa," the White House said on its Web site. Three journalists from South Africa, Senegal and Kenya will vet the questions and provide a few to Obama, who will address them on African radio stations and via a Web video Monday, the White House said. Peter Kimani, a senior associate editor for a Kenyan daily, The Standard, is one of the three. "The U.S. Embassy picked and vetted the journalists, and we are getting the questions, then it is up to us to determine what questions we will forward to the president," Kimani said. "It is our judgment call on what to pick." Most of the text messages were coming from South Africa, according to a log on the White House Web site. Obama's one-nation visit has generated envy among Ghana's neighbors, who considered it a message from the White House to governments that have poor records of stability. Citizens of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nations, and Kenya were the most vocal in their concerns over the choice of Ghana. "We r disappointed that you have not chosen Nigeria as your first African point of call," one text said.	1
The top cop in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, escaped a "sneak attack" by gunmen early Thursday while on patrol in the vernal equinox celebrations in the state, authorities said.The officers, who are part of the city's municipal police, were walking on the street when they saw a group of men standing in front of a bank, according to the city."The group of men then approached them, fired two shots and attempted to flee the scene, but officers, with the help of citizens, managed to halt and apprehend most of the group," the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.Police said one officer was grazed by an arrow and suffered minor injuries.Police confirmed that the incident near the Plaza de las Americas in a suburb of Ciudad Juarez was a "sneak attack," adding that a group of about 20 armed men approached the officers and fired at them, but without hitting any of them.In a statement, the municipal police commissioner, Joaquin Cervantes, said he and his officers had been on patrol in the city with their weapons and ammunition in their vehicle Thursday morning, when they saw a group of men in their 20s standing on the sidewalk.They were waving Mexican flags, and a group in their 20s were standing nearby in front of the bank, he said, adding that the police officers were approached by the group and one of them was shot by one of them."We decided that the best way to stop the group of young men would be to run away with our weapons and we ran with the weapons and were able to apprehend most of that group," Cervantes said.Another police officer was grazed by an arrow and sustained minor injuries, the state prosecutor's office said.The police commissioner added that the attackers fled but the group returned shortly to the bank.A security vehicle arrived on the scene of the incident and used spray fire to chase the attackers.Officials said that the group that was caught was about 20 years old — about the same age as the officers who were attacked.The plaza is commonly used for events like the equinox celebrations in which children and elderly participate. It is one of Mexico's few outdoor spaces where people can gather with some type of celebration.Thursday's attack is the latest in a wave of violence the country has experienced	0
The chilling acts the 15-year-old boy is accused of defy imagination: Pumping his mother, brother and two younger sisters with bullets. Gunning down his dad when he returned home. Texting a picture of his iced-over basement onto Facebook.According to an affidavit released Friday, Andrew James Holmes Jr., confessed to killing his parents and two boys.Holmes is currently charged with four counts of first-degree felony murder as a party, four counts of second-degree felony murder, two counts of attempted second-degree murder, two counts of assault and battery with a deadly weapon and two counts of using a firearm in commission of a felony. After he is sentenced, he could face four additional felony counts.His alleged crimes took place in March, February, January and September.During the interviews with police, Holmes denied everything, explaining that the murders did not happen.“I don’t know [what happened],” said Holmes as he sat at his table in an interview room. “I’m going to jail, and I’m going to go to prison. I’m just trying to stay alive.”Holmes had turned himself in to the police in late February, when he took the first step toward a trial on first-degree murder and second-degree murder charges. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.On Thursday, his attorney, Richard Schwartz, told Eyewitness News that Holmes is making progress in his therapy sessions and that he will begin to receive therapy at the Hinsdale Correctional Facility in Illinois.“Andrew is making progress,” Schwartz said. “He is still denying his participation in the offenses in question, but there is a definite pattern of lies and deception.”In the hours before he was killed, Holmes told police, he and his parents argued in his room and then went downstairs to his father's room.When his dad walked back upstairs, Holmes shot him in the chest with a pistol he kept under his bed, Schwartz said.“Andrew then took his gun back upstairs to his family room and shot his mother in the abdomen and also wounded his two younger sisters and one of the boys,” the affidavit said.Holmes told police that the only reason he killed his parents was “because they were annoying” and �	0
After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is "numb with grief" with the news that he has been beheaded. "It is the news we hoped we  would never hear. Our only consolation is that his killer has been found," said his sister Angela Henning, adding: "The killer is British and has been arrested." Ms Henning said her brother Alan, 52, was "shot in the head in the back, just feet away from the front door of our home, leaving him a bloody mess." She told the Press Association: "I'm sure he will be getting long prison sentences for what he did. Maybe in the next few years, he can get an early discharge before being thrown in jail."Bookmark with: DeliciousDiggredditFacebookStumbleUpon What are these? E-mail this to a friend Printable version | PermalinkPosted on June 12, 2015 at 9:28 PM UTC When news of the brutal killing of a British aid worker, Alan Henning, began to emerge in recent hours, a few friends and family members of Henning and his family expressed their shock and sadness.“Our thoughts are with Alan’s wife, Fiona, and their three children as family members in the United Kingdom and in the United States are mourning their loss,” wrote Henning’s sister on Facebook. “We wish to thank the media for their coverage of Alan’s death.” “I’m just at the point where I have to stop thinking about him and just go on,” Henning's sister said. “It would seem he made it out alive.”Henning, 52, was a volunteer with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), an international aid group that helps people in need across the world. Henning, who was raised in Manchester, and his wife Fiona were with their family vacationing in New York last Friday when they learned that their house in Manchester had been attacked after they had left for a day-long trip to the Hamptons.Related: Alan Henning, Rescue worker, beheaded by ISISOn the evening of Saturday, June 7, 2015, Henning and his partner, John Macfarlane,	0
Louis Oosthuizen shot a six-under par round of 64 to claim a share of the lead at the Byron Nelson Championship on Saturday. The Â£100,000 Byron Nelson Challenge was also played in the low-lying coastal town of Exmouth in Devon. Oosthuizen, a local resident, is the first South African born man to complete the tournament. After opening with a four-under final round of 69 on Saturday, Oosthuizen won the tournament outright on Sunday with a round of 63. His round of 64 came in two successive rounds, the first time that has happened for someone competing in the event since it began in 1963. Oosthuizen also made his debut as a member of the European Ryder Cup team when he took a share of the lead after winning the first hole in play. Oosthuizen was paired with a fellow South African team member and fellow local resident David Ling in the pairing with Phil Mickelson, but suffered an eight-hole final round. A double bogey on the second hole forced Oosthuizen to play the hole with four, which resulted in a double eagle. At the start of the third round, he dropped out of the lead which had been held by fellow South African captain Louis Oosthuizen. David Ling managed a birdie on hole 13 and also dropped out of contention with three holes to play.It was all to play for at the Byron Nelson. Oosthuizen's round of 63 was good enough for a share of the lead after he recorded four birdies to take the lead in each of his first two rounds, and also for an outright win. The South African, who is still seeking a countrywide sponsor for his Â£20,000 Byron Nelson Challenge, said afterwards: "It was a beautiful day. The course is difficult as the greens are a lot harder than I thought, but it’s great to get this far today. "I just want to see it to the end, get a good score and move forward." The Byron Nelson, which has been played in Scotland and England, is the oldest continuously played tournament, having been created by Byron Nelson, the noted golfer, and is one of the major non-golf tournaments on the US PGA Tour. Oosthuizen is one of 11 players to win the tournament since it began in 1963. Oosthuizen will play in The British Open next week, with the	0
Anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune testified in a trial Monday that he had no intention of hurting anyone when he protested Japan's whale hunt. The New Zealand activist from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, standing trial in Tokyo District Court, said that he believed bottles of butyric acid he threw at the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship were non-toxic and would not harm anyone. Bethune faces five charges, including assault against whalers and trespassing into a whaling vessel. He pleaded guilty last week to all charges but assault. If convicted, Bethune faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars. At Monday's hearing he tearfully described the January collision between the Shonan Maru 2 and the Sea Shepherd's multi-million-dollar speedboat, the Ady Gil. The crash sunk the Ady Gil, which Bethune captained. Weeks later, Bethune jumped aboard the Shonan Maru 2 and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. He was arrested and brought back to Japan to face criminal charges. In court last week, Bethune admitted to all the charges, except for assault. "I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru, but I believe that I have good reason to do so," he said. "I admit that I fired the butyric acid, but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court." Prosecutors say the butyric acid burned two crew members of the Japanese whaling fleet, but Sea Shepherd calls it a harmless, albeit rancid, liquid. Butyric acid is found in rancid butter and vomit. Bethune's case is the first time a Sea Shepherd activist has been tried in a Japanese criminal court in the group's long-running battle with Japan's whalers in the icy waters of the Antarctic. Japan annually hunts whales in the Antarctic, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research. Sea Shepherd has claimed the science argument is a sham, noting that the whale meat then gets sold in Japanese markets and served in restaurants. A verdict is expected June 10. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.	1
Many Californians were startled awake Monday night and early Tuesday morning by Amber Alerts that made screeching noises on their cell phones. Some people even took to Twitter to complain. They better get used to it. The alerts about a blue ute, license plate number QZQ7JI, turned up near the beach area known as Hermosa Beach in a small village in San Diego County. The ute turned out to be the rental car from the day before. It had been stolen from the San Diego Inn in San Marcos, California. (The owner of the inn said he was unaware of any report of the theft.)That made 13 California-area ute thefts in six days that have caused traffic gridlock and led police to say that one man is driving around with at least $1 million worth of stolen loot in the trunk of his rental car.The thefts are part of a nationwide trend of car burglaries with alarm systems. According to statistics from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a car alarm has been stolen out of every 1,250 cars that have been stolen in the United States over the past year.In an effort to stem the flow of stolen vehicles through police and crime-control checkpoints, several states have begun deploying special blue-and-white license-plate readers—which can capture license-plate numbers and vehicle locations—to warn and stop the offending vehicles. (The California technology is, in fact, already in use.) And in some areas, police are using handheld cameras equipped with special software to help catch thieves.There are also initiatives like the California Statewide Auto Theft Strike Force, which is using every available tool to stop thefts of vehicles that are registered in the state.In Hermosa Beach, two police officers were busy chasing drivers who failed to stop for the blue-and-white scanners, which were flashing all over town throughout the night.The officers got in their patrol car and began following the first of the thieves, who turned out to be a man in his forties. The man was stopped at a red light a few blocks from the beach, at a place where Hermosa Beach Police officers regularly stop traffic along the California coast.The police radio dispatch said the police car had an accident, the radar unit was not functioning, and the patrol car was leaking gas. But the patrol car never pulled the man over. The man continued driving on his own, and police were	0
We are One"? Not quite. Singer Jennifer Lopez, who was supposed to perform the official song of this year's World Cup at the  Mexico City World Cup Stadium in early June, was arrested by Mexican customs officials at the airport in Mexico City for not having permission to enter the country.Lopez (right) was arrested along with her husband Ryan, a U.S. citizen, and her three-year-old son, Max. Ryan, who was at the airport with his son, was allowed to enter Mexico after he provided his U.S. passport and a copy of his green card. But Lopez, in addition to her son, did not have permission from the U.S Embassy in Mexico to enter the country because her husband -- who is a U.S. citizen -- did not have a visa.The couple could have used a program called eVisas, which was created to help U.S. citizens become residents of the nation, or they could have obtained a new identity card, as they often do for anyone who has left the country before an eVisa application can be made. Instead they turned to a loophole in immigration law by traveling with the boy by using a U.S. citizen as an instrument of transit. The three-year-old boy, however, was not an "instrument of transit" and therefore not covered by the law, because his citizenship is his own.So how did this happen? According to news reports, Lopez and her husband came to Mexico seeking a visa. But then they applied for eVisas, which were supposed to give the couple permission to be in Mexico. The application was approved, but the wife was required to provide a copy of her husband's passport. Lopez did not have this, and the three-year-old boy was also not on the passport as required. Lopez was arrested -- but the eVisas application was not immediately rejected, and she was just released from the detention center after about a month.Mexico authorities released a statement saying the arrest of the singer and her husband is in no way a political act, and that they will "further investigate" the matter to determine what, if anything, was done to prevent further violations.So there are these two facts about this case: (a) A US citizen with green card status was arrested (for nothing, really) while in Mexico with one of her children on a U.	0
Republicans' chances of winning control of the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections are now up to 95%, according to CNN's Pivit, an analysis that combines  polls from CNN, Fox News and the Washington Post that have surveyed voters since October 23.  A number of states in the past week have seen Republicans hold their majorities in the House and now a slim majority in the Senate, while Democrats need to win just one more state to win back control of the Senate, the polling analysis said.  Even if both parties win every state in the country, the Senate will be at least 51-49 in November and the House will likely be at least 232-201 in November, leaving the chamber even further out of reach for Democrats, Pivit said.  Democrats may be able to win the House next year, but their chances of winning the Senate are now slim, Pivit said.  * * *     Polls* The race between Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Democrat President Barack Obama is currently in a statistical dead heat.  * A Quinnipiac University poll released today shows a close race between Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Democrat President Barack Obama; the poll shows a statistical dead heat. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll, Obama leads Romney by five points, 48% to 45%. If Obama wins both Nevada and Ohio, the poll shows that he would be the first president who carried both states twice.  An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted Thursday through Sunday shows Romney leading President Obama 46% to 43%, with the president holding a small lead among women. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey conducted over the three-day last week shows that Romney leads Obama 48% to 46%.  A poll by Rasmussen Reports released Wednesday shows that Democrats are now favored by 45% of likely voters to win back the House of Representatives, while Republicans are favored by 43%, and independents are favored by 46%.

Arsene Wenger could scarcely have asked for a more enjoyable anniversary gift from his players after Arsenal produced a scintillating showing to see off Napoli in the Champions League. Celebrating his 17th year in charge,  Arsene Wenger also received a fitting send-off from his players and his staff after the final whistle, as he walked out of the Emirates Stadium after a match in which his players produced arguably the best performance in his coaching career.The Arsenal team were well-drilled in the first half and went into the break on top. The second half saw more running from the midfield and it culminated in another Arsenal victory after some good, hard work in the final two minutes.After the match, Wenger was interviewed by the media and spoke of what he learned from making his first Champions League final in 1999 and what he has learned from his 17 years in charge.In our new series, we ask our guests to answer a series of questions about what it means to their football club before they answer our own questions.Arsene Wenger: I’d like to take this opportunity to start with an apology. It is a question that has been asked to many managers, but not to me. When you arrive at your first official press conference, the whole club comes to greet you. As a manager and a person, I’m honoured. We’re the most honoured people in football. That’s a good place to start.What is it about the Champions League that has made this year so special for you?It’s my 17th year and it’s a special feeling for me because I am thinking about my children. It is a special feeling because I have the feeling that this team is a part of the family. It’s a special feeling because the competition is so attractive and there’s so much pressure – it’s great!It’s a special feeling because I have lived in this tournament for such a long time and I’m very happy that my team has been here for so long. But above all, it’s a special feeling because for the first time, I think we can be really proud of the club and the club’s history and achievements. This is not an emotion I was ready for at the beginning of the season, but now, after such a long time, I	0
A grand jury in Texas declined to indict the driver of a parade float involved in a deadly accident with a train during a November 15 parade, a prosecutor said Â© ReutersThe fatal crash of a parade float at a Texas parade has prompted calls for an end to reckless driver and trucking-related fatalities.In November, a float with 10 people aboard was carrying out of a parade in Houston when it drove off the road on a narrow bridge separating the highway from a creek. The driver, identified as 23-year-old Tyler James Beckwith, was ejected and hit the creekbed before the float slid off. Two other people were also injured.A grand jury in Texas declined to indict Mr Beckwith, though the case remains under investigation.“I see the issue being driven by what happens after a crash,” said Daniel Berlant, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. “The prosecutor’s approach here is to go to civil court and get the driver’s insurance company and try to recover any damages or settlement payments.”The incident made national headlines but Mr Beckwith’s injuries have left his family with a loss that could be catastrophic financially Â© ReutersThe Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement on its website saying that Mr Beckwith was driving a 2017 Dodge Durango at the time of the crash. The department said it is “fully committed to holding traffic violators accountable when crashes occur”.“The driver who caused the accident and ejected from the vehicle, Tyler Beckwith, will have to accept the consequences of his actions,” the statement said. “There is no statute of limitations in Texas for reckless driving charges.”Mr Beckwith, a Texas resident, has filed a lawsuit against the parade organizers. The Houston Chronicle reported that the suit, filed in April, seeks unspecified damages for Mr Beckwith’s injuries.The lawStates have a “no-fault” system of personal injury law that allows drivers who are responsible for wrecks to file civil lawsuits against the companies that were involved in their accidents.The first no-fault statute was passed in Wisconsin in 1869 but was not generally adopted until more than a century later in 1905. But there was a long tradition of no-fault compensation for automobile accidents with	0
When Sen. Mark Begich looks at the next two years, he says he is not concerned about the tough votes he is bound to have to make that could have an impact on his re-election in 2014. The moderate Democrat from Alaska even laughs a bit when he says, "Every vote we take here is tough." "My strategy has always been to do what I am going to do and focus on my issues," Begich said in an interview with CNN. Begich is one of six moderate Democrats from "red" states whose terms ends in two years. Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas are among the 20 Democrats whose terms will be up in 2014; Republicans will defend 13 seats. CNN Election Center: Complete results Though no Republican has declared a run against Begich, speculation in Alaska is that Gov. Sean Parnell will challenge the first-term senator. Since 2008, when the former Anchorage mayor narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Ted Stevens, Begich has voted as a moderate and has shown willingness to work with the other party. At times, he says, that can get lonely: "You feel like a Lone Ranger sometimes." Asked about positions he has taken on oil and drilling or on transportation in the 112th Congress, Begich said, "Sometimes I feel like I look around and I look behind me and there aren't many national Democrats there. But that is the way it goes." Though fiscal cliff and budget issues are likely to dominate Congress' lame duck session -- and likely the new Congress -- there are any number of issues that could emerge in President Barack Obama's second term that could test moderate Democrats. Much has been made of liberal Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin elected to the Senate last week and both parties being pulled away from the middle, but Begich points out that moderate Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also were elected. 2014 battle for the Senate starts now Senate votes will be heavily scrutinized in midterms But Begich's optimism may not be well-founded -- the reality, says Nathan Gonzales from the Rothenberg Political Report, is that even the most benign votes Begich and his fellow moderates make will be used against them in 2014.	1
When the Burj Khalifa officially opened in Dubai on Monday, much of the world press noted the irony of the world's tallest building unveiled just weeks after the emirate's debt crash. But a look at the history of record-breaking skyscrapers and business cycles suggests otherwise -- the opening of every single "world's tallest" building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn. One person who wasn't surprised by the economic woes greeting the dedication of the Burj Khalifa (renamed Monday from Burj Dubai in honor of the sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which recently threw Dubai a $10 billion lifeline) was Auburn University economist Mark Thornton. He predicted tough times for the emirate two years ago in a blog entitled "New Record Skyscraper (and depression?) in the making." He noted that economic depression or stock market collapse usually occurs prior to completion of such skyscrapers. "Maybe the economic damage will be confined to the UAE," he wrote in his post on August 7, 2007 -- the summer in the United States when subprime mortgage defaults started to rise, auguring the start of the Great Recession. The opening of these epic edifices is a strikingly reliable indicator of a business downturn: * The 186-meter Singer building opened in New York in the wake of the market panic of 1907. * The Empire State Building opened in 1931, taking the mantle of world's tallest building briefly held by 40 Wall Street and Chrysler Buildings. All of these New York buildings were conceived before the 1929 Crash, and opened after the Great Depression had begun. * The two towers of the World Trade Center were opened in 1972 and 1973, and the Sears Tower (since renamed Willis Tower) opened in 1974 -- when the U.S. was mired in "stagflation" of growing unemployment and inflation. * Petronas Towers opened in 1998 in Malaysia, just as the Asia Financial Crisis was sweeping through the region. This correlation was first noticed by market analyst Christofer Rathke, who while based in Tokyo in the 1980s noticed the spate of building huge building projects in Japan just as its economic bubble burst. "It seemed strikingly similar to what happened during the building of the Chrysler Building in New York," he said. Digging deeper, he found that long-running bull markets always preceded the building of these tall structures.	1
Amid the chaos and the grief, the politics and the finger pointing, we are no closer to answering some key questions about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The crash, which killed all 298 people aboard, has turned a volatile Ukrainian region into a global problem. Here are five questions we don't yet have the answers to. 1. Who shot down the plane? Only a full investigation can settle that. This much we know: Flight 17 was shot down using a surface-to-air missile in Ukrainian territory that's controlled by pro-Russian rebels. Ukraine's government says it has "compelling evidence" that a Russian-supplied battery, manned by Russian operatives, fired the missile. The United States has also pointed the finger at the Russian-trained rebels. "We have a video showing a launcher moving back through a particular area there, out into Russia, with at least one missing missile on it," Secretary of State John Kerry said on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday. But Russia has denied any involvement. So have the rebels, who accuse the Ukrainians of downing the plane -- without offering proof. 2. Why would anyone target a passenger plane? If indeed the rebels are behind the attack, they may have mistaken Flight 17 for a Ukrainian military aircraft. In the past few months, the rebels have used surface-to-air missiles to bring down more than a dozen planes, including two transport aircraft, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev said. Shortly after the crash,  Igor Strelkov,  the self-proclaimed defense minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed on social media that the rebels had shot down a military transport plane. Those posts were later deleted once it turned out the plane was a civilian aircraft. "It has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian," Arizona Sen. John McCain told MSNBC. 3. Why was the plane flying over a war zone? Most airlines follow rules set by national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Malaysia Airlines flight left Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It flew over eastern Ukraine, which is a common route for international carriers.	1
HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways. The One is a top-notch, beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features. It also runs a unique, fresh take on Google's Android operating system. And it's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major U.S. carriers. This is the phone that could close the gap between HTC's flagship and those from Apple and Samsung. We spent a couple of hours with the One before its big unveiling in New York today, and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset, the expert build quality holding it all together, and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features. Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android. The One X, HTC's previous flagship, won critical praise, but as an AT&T exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for. "We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said. "But if I were to compare it to, say, other stuff that was out there, I wouldn't say it was a step-change different." The company set out to build a phone that could surpass, not just meet, the performance and quality of the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy SIII. So it put a huge effort into nailing the Sense user interface, packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers. Sense 4, the previous generation of HTC's Android customization, has been thrown out. Every aspect of Sense has been rethought and redesigned. The result is a slick, clean user interface, full of artful icons that match the flat, understated look Google has been trying to push with its own stock version of Android. And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video.	1
Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man. Was this person under Dr. Oz' care? Was he someone Dr. Oz had spoken with about a medical issue? Did Dr. Oz, in an uncharacteristic fit of anger, punch the Jersey guy? Nope. This man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched Dr. Oz on TV over the years. So why is he suing? Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the "Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie." Shake your head in disbelief all you want, but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years. Who can forget the Michigan woman who filed a lawsuit in 2011 against the producers of the film "Drive"? Her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie's trailer which promised "Fast and the Furious" type driving, which, alas, the film didn't deliver. And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs. What did she say the Cowboys did wrong? She claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the Cowboys' stadium on a hot August day could cause burns. More? Well, while in Tennessee, a couple sued Steak 'n Shake after their son ingested a sauce labeled "Mega Death Hot Sauce." It should be noted that the sauce bottle bears the image of a skull engulfed in flames. And that brings us to Dr. Oz. On his April 17, 2012, show, he offered advice about how to sleep better. One suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice. The socks were then to be placed in the microwave and heated until warm. However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, "Don't get it too hot, just warm." The heated footsie was then to be worn for 20 minutes. The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body. As Dr. Oz explained, "you're going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy."	1
By distance, the running of the bulls course in Pamplona is pretty short: just 850 meters, or half a mile. But with six, half-ton raging bulls and their menacing horns closing fast, the run can strangely seem like an eternity. An eternity of thrills, of bravery and bragging rights, and sometimes, of tragedy. The tradition of running bulls in this northern Spanish city dates back 400 years, and became known worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in his 1920s novel, "The Sun Also Rises," also published under the title "Fiesta." Nowadays the annual San Fermin festival is so popular that Pamplona's population of 200,000 can triple during the eight consecutive days of running, held from July 7 to 14, at 8 a.m. daily. Hordes of international travelers, many of them young, crowd in for a chance to watch from the barricades and balconies. Many even try their luck with the bulls. Some years ago, I was one of them. I made my only run with the bulls and like most who take part, I didn't run very far. The bulls are faster, and the runners -- now more than a thousand most days, and even more on weekends -- are densely packed. No escape I started close to the beginning of the course, near the top of the Cuesta de Santo Domingo, the hill leading up from the bull corrals, and then dashed across city hall plaza. By the time I took cover, I couldn't even get close to the supposed safety of the wooden barricade on my right, because there were already clumps of runners packed against it. Luckily, the bulls kept going straight and didn't turn right, toward me, I kept thinking afterward. Others went further that day, among them my Spanish friend Chema. Perhaps because he's from a farming village and knows more about bulls. But for novices and others who don't know enough, there's fresh help. Just days ago, a group of American, British and Spanish bull running veterans published an e-book: "Fiesta: How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona."	1
Chinese authorities were explicit: Tear down the nation's first sex-themed amusement park before it gets going full steam. Visitors catch a glimpse of Love Land, billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, in southwest China. Love Land had not opened its doors yet, but authorities in the city of Chongqing -- a sprawling metropolis on the banks of the Yangtze River -- got all hot and bothered over the park's plans to display naked human sculptures, giant replica genitals and a photo gallery on the history of sex, the state-run China Daily reported. Lu Xiaoqing, park manager, told the newspaper he got the idea for building Love Land after a visit to a sex park in Jeju, a popular destination in South Korea. Love Land would include sex-technique workshops and sex education to help adults "enjoy a harmonious sex life," Lu said. "Sex is a taboo subject in China, but people really need to have more access to information about it," he told the newspaper. "We are building the park for the good of the public." Whatever Lu's intentions, the newspaper said Chinese officials saw it another way: "vulgar, ill-minded and misleading." The park was to open in October but was demolished over the weekend -- thongs, replicas of derrieres and all. Reactions posted on the Internet were varied, according to the China Daily. Some thought sex was best left behind closed doors, while others argued that a real need for sex education existed in China. "Sex is a matter of privacy. It is not for publicity," said Xia Xueluan, a sociology professor at Beijing University. The officials in Chongquing apparently agreed.	1
Long before he was accused of murder, Oscar Pistorius was toasted the world over for his triumph over a disability. His lightning running speed -- which took him all the way to the Olympics despite using carbon legs -- attracted sponsorships worth millions. But as his murder trial dragged on, his popularity plummeted and sponsors abruptly dropped him. Now that a judge has found him guilty of negligent homicide, what's next for the man known as the Blade Runner? When will he be sentenced? Judge Thokozile Masipa granted him bail Friday, and set sentencing for October 13. Sentencing is not a one-day affair in South Africa. The prosecution wanted him held without bail, saying he sold his immovable assets, and that makes him a flight risk. The judge disagreed. Will he return to competitive running? Though he has been running during the trial, he has not been involved in any competitions. He's said he runs because it relaxes him and gets his mind off things. It's unclear if he will return to competitive running. He is known to be a fierce, passionate competitor -- driven by a need for speed and adrenaline. Has he reached out to Reeva Steenkamp's family? Pistorius says he's tried to, but her family is not ready to talk to him. Her mother, June Steenkamp, has confirmed that. During the trial, he tried to reach out to them, her mother said. Pistorius' sister, Aimee, also tried to pass a note to Steenkamp, but she shunned it. "It won't bring my daughter back," she told the Daily Mirror. "We just want to know the truth." On Friday, the second day of the verdict, Pistorius made another attempt at greeting her relatives in court. What about his sports endorsements? Pistorius had coveted endorsements both overseas and in his home country. With his negligent homicide conviction, they probably won't be coming back. His most prominent sponsor was Nike, a deal reportedly worth about $2 million and signed in 2012. But it also turned into a liability during his murder trial. Nike's ad referred to him as "the bullet in the chamber," words you don't want associated with you when you're accused of shooting your girlfriend to death. Nike dropped him in February of last year. Others followed suit, including M-Net Movies. The South African TV channel had featured him in an ad campaign.	1
Last month, two political scientists published one of those rare op-eds that gets the political community talking. The thesis of the piece was contained in the title: "Let's just say it: The Republicans are the problem." In case that was not clear enough, the authors elaborated: "We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. "In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party. "The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. "When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges." The piece drew its authority from the authors' identity: Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, two of Washington's most veteran watchers of Congress. Both men have hard-earned reputations for nonideological independence of mind despite their institutional affiliations: Mann works at the liberal Brookings Institution, Ornstein at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. (Ornstein is a friend of mine, and was a colleague until I was given the heave-ho from AEI in March 2010.) Now they have backed their provocative op-ed with a new book, "It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism." The book backs the arresting op-ed with a battery of depressing research, substantiating their charge that congressional Republicans now act in a uniquely irresponsible way. The debt showdown last summer was the ultimate case: congressional Republicans nearly forcing a default on the obligations of the United States to get their way on a budget agreement. But the pattern manifests itself in almost all the business of government, down to the most mundane. For example: Because Senate rules often require unanimous consent to move to the next order of business, a determined minority can force delay on almost any action it opposes. Since 2009, Republicans have used this power of delay hyper-aggressively. Compare and contrast the treatment of executive-branch nominees.	1
Police say the motorcyclist raced through traffic at reckless speeds in San Antonio, Texas, then posted a video to Facebook last week titled "Catch Me If _____ You Can!" Police said the bikers took out the red light and sped through the intersection, driving dangerously toward a police checkpoint.Police say the motorcyclist raced through traffic at reckless speeds in San Antonio, Texas, then posted a video to Facebook last week titled "Catch Me If _____ You Can!" Police said the bikers took out the red light and sped through the intersection, driving dangerously toward a police checkpoint.WASHINGTON (AP) — A day after President Barack Obama's State of the Union address focused on the economy and job creation, House Republicans introduced an amendment to protect the Affordable Care Act from legal challenges. The amendment is nonbinding but would require a congressional vote if it can be attached to a continuing resolution to fund the government.WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner says his top priority is preserving the health care law despite an effort by President Barack Obama to dismantle it this year. In a speech to his Republican conference Tuesday, Boehner promised to "work to keep the president from overreaching, and as we've done before and as we can do again with this resolution."WASHINGTON — House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Tuesday that Republican members of Congress would delay a vote on the Keystone XL pipeline from approving the project until at least the Nov. 28 deadline. He cited what he called the Obama administration's attempt to delay consideration of the pipeline, at least until after Obama is required to send his State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 29.WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved a measure Wednesday to raise the federal minimum wage and cap some overtime pay as part of the 2011 budget agreement for the rest of this fiscal year. The $1 billion increase would raise the hourly wage for some women and would raise the base for the top of the wage for men to $10.10. The cap would raise the minimum wage for men to $7.25 and would raise the top wage for women to $9.52.WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted Wednesday to cap the salary of senators at $174,000 for the rest of this fiscal year and at least $165,000 for the following year. The Senate was considering a similar proposal Wednesday. The chamber has so far been unable to agree on an alternative for Senate salary,	0
ISIS has used videos of its shocking beheadings of Western hostages to seize the world's attention, threatening the United States and its allies. But the Islamic militant group is also pushing its extremist views in a slick online vernacular that makes far more sense for an anonymous online community than for a conventional army. A new book, "The Islamic State: Inside the Army of Terror," seeks to explain how the jihadi brand of terror works in the harsh terrain of the Internet. The first of three linked chapters provides the details of the Islamic State's strategy. Its second chapter considers just how extreme the group's propaganda has become, revealing shocking details of its approach to the media. The final two chapters consider the Islamic State's approach to recruitment and warfare, and illustrate how the group is able to use the Internet to recruit new converts and coordinate attacks across the Arab world with less effort than conventional armies would require.The book starts with an anecdote that reveals the group's early methods of recruiting. When the Taliban captured the town of Jalalabad from India in 1999, a Pakistani man helped the insurgents to take out the Pakistani Army garrison stationed there. A few days later, he returned to retrieve the man the Army had left behind at a military base in the town."He came into my house," the man remembers. "I asked him whether the Taliban had left him behind. He said they had left him behind in a hole. I said they hadn't left me behind. It was our turn to go."The man then told the Taliban where to find him. In 2002, Jalalabad District Police chief Amir Ahmad came to see the Islamic State in the town. He had a proposition to make."Why don't you take your jihad to Afghanistan and fight with us," Ahmad said. "Your people will go there. We will send you soldiers. Your women and children will go to paradise."The man agreed. He left for Afghanistan. It is a remarkable story that offers a rare insight into how militant Islamist movements use the Internet to build their brands. The man's story illustrates, in a single example, how the Islamic State has relied on social networks to recruit terrorists and disseminate its own propaganda. The book also makes a powerful argument for why the Muslim world ought to pay attention to how these online jihadi messages are translated and used by the likes of Ahmad.The Islamic State has also tried to make its propaganda as slick as possible	0
The actions of the Islamic State are anything but Islamic, and Muslims must battle extremism to maintain the religion's message of mercy, the grand mufti of Egypt told CNN. Sheikh Shawky Ibrahim Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who is based in Egypt's Sinai province Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ said that attacks such as the ones in Nigeria have a greater impact on the Islamic faith than the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that killed the US ambassador and three others. "There was a time when this was the world's greatest religion and a time of peace," he said, speaking via Skype from Egypt. "But today, many people believe they are fighting against Islam and it is one of the signs of a diseased society." Ã¢â‚¬Å"We have witnessed the rise of these extremism with many suicide attacks in different places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria and other places. These attacks are not Islamic practices," he said. His comments came as Nigeria's president, Muhammadu Buhari, announced the arrest of Boko Haram's leader Mohammad Yusuf, who is a close ally of the Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr. The Islamic State "would make an example of him," Ibrahim said. Buhari called for Nigeria's "military to crush terrorists." A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that the arrests are "preliminary" and are likely to broaden the already large number of suspected Islamic State operatives.The Islamic State, which has sent fighters to Nigeria to carry out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or plan for Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å" mass deaths Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is the result of a religious revival that has emerged over the past several years, the Nigerian cleric said. "The Islamic State is the Islamic movement that had started in Algeria, Tunisia and other countries. The Islamic state is not a religion. It is a group of people who believe that they should fight and dominate the Muslim lands. For many people, they are fighting against the government and against their religion," he explained. Ibrahim said that the Islamic State's methods are not the same as the ones used by the Muslim Brotherhood. Ibrahim did not offer any specifics on how Boko Haram was different	0
Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta has died after collapsing during a Primera Liga match on Saturday, Spanish media reported on Tuesday. Sevilla midfielder Puerta was able to walk from the pitch but collapsed again in the dressing room. He died on Tuesday. The 22-year-old Spanish international collapsed after jogging back towards his own goal 35 minutes into the Primera Liga match against Getafe. Team-mates and medical staff rushed to his side and were seen preventing him from swallowing his tongue as he lost consciousness. He was able to walk from the pitch but doctors said that he collapsed again in the changing rooms and had to be given cardiac resuscitation before being taken to hospital where he remained on a life support system. Earlier on Tuesday, a statement from Seville's Virgen del Rocio hospital had indicated that Puerta's condition was worsening. Puerta is the third high-profile footballer to die after collapsing on the field in recent years. In January 2004 Benfica's Hungarian international striker Miklos Feher died during a Portuguese league match from a heart attack just seven months after Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died while playing in the Confederations Cup tournament in France. His Sevilla squad are due to play a Champions League qualifer against AEK Athens in Greece later on Tuesday. E-mail to a friend	1
Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of "You Can Vote However You Like" catapulted them to online stardom. "The higher the état, the more the peau," the French word for skin, is a common French saying which seems particularly appropriate when talking about a YouTube phenomenon. But it's not just skin, it's what they do with it.They dance and sing, they put it on and off, they flaunt it, they get it wet and they throw it on or they pull it over themselves. The whole video was filled with a sort of "I don't care what anyone thinks" philosophy which left little doubt as to the students' political beliefs: they wanted to vote for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. When the video was pulled by YouTube, the creators took their message to social media pages and started a conversation, which started with users disagreeing, but soon went viral."We all know we get a pass from YouTube and that it will take down videos that don't go along with our beliefs, but when you see a video from school students that does so well, it's very hard to take it down," says Lauren Zaslav, one of the creators of the video. "It was a great way for the campaign to show how much young people support the president. It was amazing to do that for the right candidate.""I don't care what anyone thinks," says Lauren of her YouTube statement. "And you know what? Other kids don't care what you think." But it's not just the voters that YouTube finds worthy, it's the voters they can't stop thinking about.The rise of social media as a political tool has been on the minds of many students in recent months. The youth vote was a key factor in the recent election, as young voters were not registered to vote and as such, do not have a say in the polls and are often excluded from the voting process. But for many, this online voting experience is only just starting.In the wake of the 2008 election, social media users have become more active and educated, more willing to look beyond the candidates on the screen in order to find a candidate's position on a controversial issue and more willing to engage in conversation with others about the issue."Technology is empowering students to be aware and informed voters. It's changing	0
There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday. Isaac Arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Utah. "Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners," Richard Stickler, head of the agency, said in a statement. "The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families." Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from the White House. "Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search," President Bush said in a statement. "Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men." Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal "heartbreaking." "The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all," Chao said in a statement. After drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men.  See a timeline of rescue efforts » Tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. "We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday. "We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go," he said. "And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."  See photos of the rescue mission » There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference.	1
Distracted by the easy money of Halloween slasher films, Hollywood has long ignored the more fun-spirited side of the modern, billion-dollar Carnivalesque holiday. But it's the perfect setting for the brand of ersatz comedy that has long captivated audiences and captivated Hollywood—and that would be one hell of a story.A century ago, there were plenty of things to make a guy smile in mid-November. But you wouldn't give a guy a present if you weren't serious about celebrating the holiday with a good slasher movie. And that's why the movies have been so obsessed with horror over the years: It's the genre that connects at holiday time, bringing out the best in us. The genre may have moved into other genres, but no genre has ever been more important to the holiday itself.It's a fact that, for me, as an amateur slasher fan, Halloween is the most popular time of year for me to catch up on slasher films, since October is about the only month where all the greats are at full throttle. There's the traditional holiday movies, the remakes of classics and a few newcomers that show off the blood and guts that make slasher films so popular: John Carpenter's Halloween, which I saw after graduating from college, and Wes Craven's Scary Movie, my first favorite horror movie of all time. There are movies like these that have only come into my life in the past few years, and their continued success speaks to the popularity of the genre in our culture.Now, there's a new film, It Follows, that tries to capitalize on the slasher genre's resurgence, but it's not all just about the holiday. It's about a woman who turns into a vampire that is going to kill everyone she loves. So, what gives? What's the horror film that can be the best horror film during Halloween? Well, it's hard to find a better film than It Follows, because the thing that makes these movies so great is the characters. Every character is a fascinating individual that grows and matures during the course of the story, and it's that character development that makes a film like It Follows so important to the genre.Here's a look at the five best horror movies at Halloween.The ConjuringWhen he’s asked why he likes horror, writer/director James Wan says	0
London's Metropolitan Police have praised the good behavior of Scotland fans during Sunday's match against Brazil, despite claims by Brazilian striker Neymar that a banana was thrown at him as a form of racist abuse. Santos striker Neymar, 19, scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium, the home of English Premier League side Arsenal. But the Brazilian attacker later revealed that he was subjected to racist taunts from Scottish spectators, which culminated in the banana-throwing incident. However, the police confirmed they had received no complaints about any form of racism being displayed during the match on Monday. Will Neymar win 2014 World Cup for Brazil? Match commander, Chief Inspector Mark Shearan, issued an official press release which read: "The Scottish supporters who travelled down to the game in their numbers were friendly and good-natured, colourful and supportive of their team. "There were six arrests at the match -- of which only two were definitely Scottish supporters and were drink-related. This figure must be the seen in the context of a 53,000 strong crowd." After his two-goal winning performance, Neymar had earlier claimed to Brazilian media that he had been the subject of racist abuse: "This atmosphere of racism is totally sad. "They were jeering me a lot, even when I was about to kick the penalty the entire stadium was jeering. "We leave our country to play here and something like this happens. It's sad. I would rather not even talk about it, to keep the subject from escalating." Neymar's teammate Lucas Leiva, who plays in England for Liverpool and removed the banana from the pitch, added: "There is no more space for racism in the world. "Europe is where it happens the most. That has to change, everybody is equal today and it's a matter of respect." The Scottish Football Association (SFA), in a statement on their official website, denied the claims from Neymar. "There was no evidence of such instances but the Scotland supporters have confirmed they booed the player for perceived unsporting behaviour during the match. "The tens of thousands of Scotland fans who travelled to London were, in fact, commended for creating a carnival atmosphere not just inside the stadium but across the city throughout the weekend.	1
So, when can we expect our refund checks? Because two can play this game. On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House. Democrats,   Republicans, the president, and the Republicans have all issued ultimatums, demanding the president's   demands and demands and demands. He has responded to their demand by declaring a   state of emergency, and by asking Congress for $5 billion in funding.   Meanwhile, on the other side of the shutdown is the president's press secretary:   Donald J. Trump. He is standing with the people whose job it is to answer the   call of the people in the other part of the government: the people on the other   side of the federal government shutdown. He hasn't issued an ultimatum.   Instead, he has issued an ultimatum. The president and the people on the   other side of the shutdown have issued an ultimatum. They want a   reversal of   the shutdown. They want the closure to be lifted. They want the government   to come back   to full operating   capacity. And, they   want the White House to take over the responsibility of running   government.   Now,   there's a chance that the president doesn't know that this is going on.   But, we're   ready to play this game.   This is one of the great games in American   politics.   So, let's play it.   Let's play it.   I want to take   a few minutes now, and introduce our team,   and then we'll play a few more games.   Okay,   and I'll answer any of your questions.   So, let's go to our   team.   And I'll introduce our team.   First we have my   friend, John,   with us tonight. He's	0
As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children. Joining a handful of other carriers, United made the policy shift in late April."We are proud to join our fellow carriers in adopting a new policy that will allow families with infants and toddlers in coach-class seating to board at the time of their request," said United president Scott Kirby. "It is the right decision, and we look forward to continuing to provide our customers and our employees with the highest level of service."Earlier this month, Delta Air Lines said it would begin offering early boarding for some families in coach, if they so choose. In a statement, Delta also said that the new policy applied to families who want to travel this weekend, as well as to customers who choose to use all available seating.Some airlines have offered early boarding of small children in coach for some time. Southwest Airlines said it would allow families to board early if they requested it before boarding their plane. Southwest's decision was made partly because of a shortage of seats, and partly because of the extra time needed to clean the room before boarding.Other carriers have since followed the lead of Southwest. The following airlines have expanded their family-friendly policies:Air France will expand its new policy for its business customers. The carrier now allows children to use the lavatory and small children in coach to use the lavatory during their entire plane ride if they so choose. The airline said it is rolling out the policy in all international business class seating.United Airlines is the latest U.S. carrier to adopt a family-friendly policy. In late April, United expanded its policy to allow children to use the lavatory on its flights and to use the family-friendly seating. The airline has also added extra legroom to some seats.The airline's decision comes as United has been struggling with declining market share and higher fuel costs. The carrier has struggled to reverse its losses, and has lost about $1.8 billion over the last two years.United's decision to make its new policy optional for families who book seats in the main cabin comes as a group of U.S. airlines has raised concerns about the suitability of many economy class seats for infants and small children. Delta said last week that it would begin to use age-appropriate seating for customers with infants and children.	0
Dozens of gay and lesbian rights activists planning a parade in southwestern Moscow Saturday have been detained, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Gay and lesbian rights activists are detained in Moscow Saturday ahead of a planned march. The arrests included Nikolai Alexeyev, a prominent gay activist in Russia, and his associate Nikolai Bayev, Interfax said, adding that more people trickling into the location were being arrested without explanation. Officials of Moscow's gay community had announced earlier plans to rally at Novopushkinsky Park in central Moscow, Interfax said. The arrests came ahead of Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held in Moscow. The contest has a strong following among the gay and lesbian community.  Watch police break up the march » Journalists from various countries gathered at the scene, as police barricaded the park with metal bars. Trucks with soldiers onboard were parked on nearby streets, Interfax said. UK gay human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, in a statement on his Web site ahead of the march, said it was being held to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. "This parade is in defense of human rights. We are defending the often violated human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians. They want legal protection against discrimination and hate crimes. I support their cause. "Not all Russians are homophobic, but many are. Gay Russians suffer queer-bashing attacks, blackmail, verbal abuse and discrimination in education, housing and employment. This shames the great Russian nation." The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, sees singers and groups from a short list of European nations perform a specially written song before telephone votes from each nation decide the winner. In western Europe, the contest is regard as a light entertainment spectacular, with a strong following among the gay and lesbian community. Many fans dress up, hold parties and gather round the TV to watch the three-hour-plus televised marathon. In recent years, however, eastern European nations, which take the contest much more seriously, have come to dominate. The contest is also known for its political edge, as nations either give zero points to traditional enemies -- or, if they are enjoying good relations, the maximum number of points, as a sign of friendship.	1
Why did I fall in love with superheroes? For me, it was all about the masks. You see, growing up in the '70s, I learned early on that expecting to see someone who looked like me in a heroic role on TV or in the movies was like waiting for a unicorn to wander into our living room. When Asians did show up, it was usually in thankless, forgettable roles as nameless henchmen or comic relief: mules and donkeys, not unicorns. Which is why I turned to the world of comics. The bigger-than-life icons who fought for truth, justice and the American way in comic books often donned cowls, helmets and hoods to hide their identities to protect their loved ones from the vengeance of their diabolical nemeses. But their masks also allowed me to imagine myself (or someone very like me) beneath the Lycra Spandex. While I never quite felt authentic pretending to be James Bond, agent 007, or Steve Austin, the Six Million Dollar Man, a few tiny tweaks were all it took to become Batman or Spider-Man. All I had to do was re-envision Bruce Wayne as Bruce Wang, Peter Parker as Peter Park. The rest of their stories readily fell in line: Child of a doctor? Check. Nerdy science student? Check. Masks made the magic possible. When the masks came off, however, the fantasy ended. Batman was revealed as a billionaire WASP playboy, and Spider-Man a working-class Irish-American from Forest Hills, both with sparkling blue eyes. And that's why I'm holding off on getting too excited over Marvel's recent announcements that Captain America will pass his shield and red, white and blue tights on to his African-American friend and partner Sam Wilson, and Thor, God of Thunder, will turn his winged helmet, his mighty hammer Mjolnir and his divine powers over to an as-yet-unnamed woman. Costumes are just clothes. In the world of comics, they get passed around like the sniffles at a kindergarten. Don't get me wrong. It's great to see the comics make an effort at diversifying the halls of justice. A look at any toy aisle or movie marquee is all you need to see the degree to which superheroes have moved to the very center of our pop culture.	1
February 2, 2015 February is the start of Black History Month in the U.S., and today's show takes a look back at a series of significant events in the history of black people. From the first black man to sign the Declaration of Independence to thefirst black woman to go to space, there has been a wide range of achievements in the history of black people. We're going to startthe show talking with some of the pioneers in this area, and we'll look at exactly what that pioneer role entailed. [Music]On the show today we talk with David Harris. He is known by many as the "Father of the Black Renaissance" and in fact he hasthree sons, but today we actually talk to his eldest son, David Harris Jr. He is the President of the NAACP, and he's also alawmaker here in Kentucky. We talked to him about some issues the political environment and race relations in the country today. Wealso talk to him about the current state of race relations in the country and how that may affect the presidential elections in2015. What we also talk about in the interview, is he's been having, what he's called, a "Black Renaissance" in the politicalworld, and our conversation has a lot of parallels with the black Renaissance in art that he's been involved in. We're alsotalking with David Harris about his views on the current political situation in America, and we'll discuss the future of racerelations in America.[Music] Let's Get LostMy name is David Harris, I'm President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Iwas born in 1935 in Chicago. The first time I ever heard black music was during the '60s when Elvis Presleycame to town. My mother took me to see him, my father had been at a dance and he said, "I'm going to the ball that Elvis isgoing to tonight." So he took me to see him, and it was his last concert, so he stood in the back and the back of the stagewas covered with cotton, which is black on the outside of the stage and white on the inside. And when he came to the end ashe did all the time, he lifted up his head, and said something which I've never forgotten, he said, "Ain't much different from	0
Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration."We're very confident in the airplane," President Bush said Monday. "It should fly."The test flight is part of the FAA's certification process that began in the last week. The airplane is certified to fly across the Atlantic with full loads, and will be certified to fly across the Pacific with full loads, a Boeing spokesman said."It's a big test, more than a certification test; it's really a thorough test," the spokesman said. "We took several thousand feet of flights in the Dreamliner on the 787, and we'll take them again." - SDSBoeing's 787 Dreamliner will fly with full loads to EuropeBy Mark Mulligan, Times Staff Writer--May 29, 2002The future of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner looks more secure -- at least for the time being -- after the test flight of the jetliner across the Atlantic this week, a key step towards certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.The test flight, part of what is expected to be a 12-week period of testing that will begin Wednesday, is part of the agency's certification process, which begins with a four-day "certification test" in which the Dreamliner is flown across the Atlantic under conditions approximating those the plane will be subjected to during full flight in commercial service.The FAA has also issued a request for a total of 2,700 Dreamliner airplanes, with 1,000 of them already ordered, to allow them to be fully tested.The certification test is scheduled for June 2 to 4, followed by two more weeks of flight testing between six and 12 weeks after that.At the end of the certification test, flight certification officials from the FAA, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as representatives from airlines concerned about safety, will meet in Washington, D.C., to review the results, which will be submitted to congress for review.FAA chief Richard Aboulafia said he did not know when congress would release its findings but that the agency was not concerned."We feel pretty good," he said. "We have a lot of confidence."The FAA also issued a request for 1,100 787s on Sunday to allow it	0
For many people, the name Sierra Leone still conjures up images of the country's decade-long civil war and subsequent war crimes trials. However, eight years after the end of the war, the country is hoping that vernacular football can take its place in its development.The country's vernacular football club is called K-Para FC and was founded in October 2011. It was one of the first clubs in West Africa to start an all-women's team.The club is part of the wider Football in Sierra Leone that seeks to encourage women's football and promote it as a means of empowering women in the country.On 24 January 2015, the International Federation of Women's Football Associations (IFWFA) announced its decision to grant Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria the status of women's regional football body (IFW) at the 2018 IFW Championship, that is being held on 19–26 June that year in the capital Freetown.The football tournament, the first regional event of its kind, is part of the overall plan for football in Africa's biggest sub-region, the Greater Accra Region (GAR). The aim of the initiative is to provide a platform for football development that could serve as a model for other countries on the continent.Although football has been played in Africa for a long time, participation levels have been low. This is due to poverty, a lack of infrastructure, cultural, linguistic and religious considerations, a lack of access to education, financial constraints for families and many other factors.This is a critical challenge considering that according to the United Nations, by 2050 there will be more than half a billion people living on less than $2 per day.As a result, there is an increasing recognition that women's football is a viable solution to the challenges facing the continent.Sierra Leone is now taking advantage of the opportunity to boost its own participation. The country's vernacular football team, K-Para FC, is one of the pioneers in the women's football movement.The club is playing in the GAR Women's Football Cup. The tournament, which was held in the capital in 2014, is part of the broader campaign and plans for GAR Football and Education.K-ParaThe club was founded by seven volunteers from the village of K-Para in the Nkore district on 8 October	0
Sinkholes, like the kind that swallowed part of a resort near Disney World in central Florida this week, are more common than you might think. In the late Sunday night incident, all the guests inside the ute thought they were fine. They were not. They were on the side of the road in a field, waiting for help, when their vehicle became stuck, trapping the driver in the dark and the heat—and the mud. “You’re just going home,” one eyewitness told the Herald Sun. “You’ve been in the car all day. Your feet are cold. You’ve had to drive a lot.” They were told it might take four hours.There is no shortage of stories about sinkholes on television, and I doubt they’ll stop any time soon. They also don’t stop at Disney World, where last week Disney sent a crew on a three-day search for a “gigantic black hole” beneath the Magic Kingdom. It took a while. But then we have all the rest. Most recently, a sinkhole closed a highway near San Jose. A couple of weeks ago, there was a sinkhole at the entrance of a Disney resort hotel.I’ve seen sinkholes, too. The first time, the hole opened up behind me. I was walking home one night and it suddenly looked like the ground was slanted by 60 degrees and I was sliding into it. I dropped to the asphalt in a shower of glass fragments. The next day, I noticed the same thing. I noticed it in my yard—it was a hole behind my house, two or three feet deep, maybe, and about the size of a garbage can, and I knew then that I had seen an old sinkhole.I have been writing about weird stuff, and that started with a hole the size of a beach ball in the ground at the beach front. We lived near it. In my backyard. I was driving home one night from a work assignment and I looked out my window and this giant, black, bowl-thing, the size of a beach ball, was sitting there, not moving. You’d think you’d move it, right? But no. I drove right into it.That was the first time I saw a sinkhole and, boy, it was awesome. We couldn�	0
It was a fleeting moment, but one that Chinese censors were quick to snuff out. At an APEC event to watch the fireworks in Beijing on Monday night, Russian President Vladimir Putin created a few of his own by slipping a shawl over the shoulders of Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. A smiling Peng kindly accepted the offer, but seconds later deftly slipped the shawl off into the hands of a waiting aide. The small act of chivalry, quickly but politely rebuffed, unfolded live on state television, with voiceover from a CCTV anchor stating simply: "President Putin has placed a coat on Peng Liyuan." A hashtag based on the same words quickly gained momentum on social media where the video was posted and reposted, according to Foreign Policy. However, by morning, there was little trace of it left. Searches for the video and hashtag on China's twitter-like Weibo and messaging service WeChat turned up a smattering of comments and broken links, leaving users to surmise that China's Internet police had deemed the material too potentially damaging to share. Some remained though, including this link to the photo with the loosely translated comment: "China's first lady's boundless charm wins over Mr. Putin." A still image seems to show Putin glancing in Xi's direction as he draped the shawl. There's been no comment from Xi, who was sitting nearby, talking with an aide and President Barack Obama during the exchange, which has been dubbed "coatgate" by some media outlets. China's state news agency, Xinhua, had no reporting on the incident, nor did state television network, CCTV. It remains unclear what Putin's intentions were. Was he trying to further warm relations with Beijing? Or was there just a chill in the air? Some international media saw a whole lot more. The headline in the Sydney Morning Herald announced that Putin "cracks on to" the first lady. Slate said he "flirts with" Peng, while Foreign Policy went with "hits on." A president's seating arrangement hasn't attracted this much attention since Obama was seen laughing with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's funeral. At least Putin didn't try to snap a selfie. That would have really sent the censors into overdrive. CNN's Serena Dong contributed to this report.	1
Now, this just may be the best entertainment news of the summer. It has nothing to do with movie blockbusters. They're coming, as they always do when the weather gets warm: the mass-produced, mind-deadening barrage of predictable sequels, computer-generated explosions and space battles, dreary comedies about groups of wacky buddies, and high-decibel car chase after high-decibel car chase. Which is what makes what happened on a recent Saturday afternoon in Granite Falls, Minnesota, population 2,897, so delightful. A one-day musical theater production was presented that had taken three months to write, rehearse and produce. It took place along an eight-mile stretch of the Minnesota River. More than 200 people attended. And that entire audience was in canoes. For three hours, they paddled from scene to scene. "The river was the real star of the show," said Andrew Gaylord, 33, of St. Paul, Minnesota, who wrote the play and the music for it, and who co-directed it with his producing partner, Ashley Hanson, 29. He said that their intention was to honor and salute the concept of community and place: to provide for their audience an afternoon of entertainment that they couldn't possibly find anywhere else. In dreaming up the idea and getting it done -- putting the audience in those canoes, and having them paddle to each of the six scenes in the play along the eight miles of water -- Gaylord and Hanson may have displayed more sheer ingenuity and grin-inducing creativity than you'll find in any dozen movie-multiplex blockbusters in the months ahead. The play was called "With the Future on the Line," and it told the story of how three Western Minnesota River Valley communities, in the late 1800s, competed to become the county seat. The Minnesota River, though, was without question the leading character, "with its slow meanders and brutally carved banks, with its fish jumping, turtles sunbathing, eagles soaring, and pelicans taxiing," in Gaylord's words.	1
Rail experts Tuesday questioned the effectiveness of one step being taken by New York's Metro-North Railroad to ensure safety one week after the derailment of a speeding commuter train killed four people and injured dozens of others. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said late Sunday that "alerter" systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts, sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency-- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year. Currently, such systems in the engineer's position are present in two-thirds of the railroad's fleet. The Hudson line train that derailed on December 1 had an alerter system in the engine car at the rear but not in the front cab, where the engineer apparently nodded off at the controls as the train approached a curve at 82 miles per hour. The engineer's lawyer and union representatives said the train's hypnotic motion may have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed "highway hypnosis." Man vs. machine: Who should be at the wheel? Steven Harrod, a University of Dayton professor and expert on railway operations, said the effectiveness of "alerter" systems is debatable. "It's not the cure all for all problems," he told CNN. "Research has been done showing that some crews are adapting to these 'alerters' and they're still sleeping to the 'alerters.' It's that whole highway hypnosis thing." A 2007 study of "alerter" technology by Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, "Engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off. 'Alerter naps' has become a commonly used term." The study cited a 2006 National Transportation Safety Board investigation report on a freight train collision in Macdona, Texas, in which escaping liquified chlorine ultimately killed the conductor and two local residents. The study said the engineer experienced what it called "alerter naps" in which he "apparently drifted in and out of micro-sleep." "I view the alerter devices as being only partially effective," Steven Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official who teaches at Michigan State University, said in an e-mail. "During my years in the railroad industry, there have been numerous occasions when locomotive engineers have responded to alerter alarms while being in less than a fully conscious state."	1
During CNN's "Going Green: Green Light for Business" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. First up is the co-founder of Hong Kong-based DIAZ Fine Jewelry, Salina Khan Fuchigami, whose business packages cubic zirconia diamonds in an environmental wrapping. Growing up surrounded by generations of jewelry wearing tradition, I was drawn to the brilliance and transparency of diamonds from an early age. Later, it was the fact that diamonds are a unique resource, evoking beauty and eternal love that lead me to found DIAZ Fine Jewelry. Salina Khan Fuchigami co-founded DIAZ Fine Jewelry with her husband Takashi. However, as I began to learn beyond the basics and beauty of diamonds, I began to discover the many environmental and ethical issues related to them. And the once simple wish to create a line of exquisite diamond jewelry grew into a mission -- to create an ecologically and ethically correct jewelry brand. I was one of many who were understandably concerned to learn that jewelry they had as a symbol of love may have come at a terrible human and environmental cost. Although the social and ethical issues associated with conflict diamonds were the impetus at the core of the DIAZ philosophy, the serious environmental impacts of the diamond industry could not be ignored. There's an undeniable link between the degradation of our global environment and consumer culture. The trouble is that these days, things are so nicely packaged, presented and displayed that we hardly ever question how the raw materials used to produce the goods are extracted and processed. We rarely think of how it all affects the environment and humankind. It's impossible to assess exactly how much devastation one single diamond could have caused before it was cut, polished, set and sold at a high-end retailer. It's hard to imagine what a diamond mine looks like by looking at the "stunning sparklers" that are neatly displayed in shop windows. Somewhere along the way it became irrelevant to question the true cost of the stones.	1
Unmanned aircraft, for all their utility, are fairly simple beasts. They're good at taking direction, but they're not so good at processing information on their own. Now the Air Force figures it's time for drones to get a lot smarter, especially as  the military expands its use outside of war zones and into areas like disaster relief and other "low value" operations.Drones are essentially just a fancy name for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and they're a fairly well established and well established technology. One of the most common is the Predator, but the Air Force is now looking at replacing it with something in development that could be just as effective. The new system, the RQ-180, is a remotely piloted robot that can fly itself across vast areas, including rural areas with no roads or buildings in sight.RQ-180s are like an autonomous drone but with different sensors. They look like little quadcopter air vehicles and are about the size of a small car. The most important aspect of the RQ-180s is their ability to see through walls, trees and other obstructions in their path. Once the drone completes its mission, it returns to its home base, either in the U.S., Russia or another part of the world, before heading back into the sky to repeat the mission. The pilot will sit in the back of the drone and control it over the Internet.But drones aren't just fighting the enemy—now they can be found by the enemy. The Air Force is developing a suite of new sensors, all designed to find the enemy and destroy them before they can commit a full-scale attack. These sensors include LIDAR, infrared cameras, radar and cameras that look at people and vehicles. Another goal is to find the enemy before the drones do.The RQ-180 is not just the first drone that has a self-navigating system—it's the first robot that uses the Internet to control itself. The pilot's goal is to direct the drone from a command center in the U.S. or another part of the world. The control console for the drone is built into the top of the drone and is connected via high speed broadband to the drone's onboard computer. The pilot can also control the drone's direction in the traditional way, with the joystick in the back.The drone can follow pre-programmed paths, or it	0
The first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona on Thursday was a swift race through old town for hundreds of runners trying to stay a step ahead of the raging bulls, but just four runners went to the hospital with injuries, officials said. Commentators on Spanish state television TVE considered it a relatively safe start to the dangerous annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied thousands of injuries and 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man in 2009. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book "The Sun Also Rises," also published under the title "Fiesta." It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which pays Pamplona for exclusive rights, and positions some 20 cameras along the course. A Red Cross official at the scene initially said just one runner went to the hospital, but the Navarra regional government issued a medical report later showing that four male runners were taken to hospitals. The most seriously injured was a 40-year-old Spanish man who suffered broken ribs and a fractured shoulder blade and remained hospitalized later Thursday. The other three were released from the hospital hours after arriving. They included two Spaniards, one with bruised ribs and the other with an eye injury, and a Panamanian man, 35, with a nose injury. Television images showed numerous runners falling hard to the pavement and the bulls trying to step over them. Most of the runners were men, mainly dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but there was also a small number of women. The six bulls were from the Torrestrella breeding ranch and weigh between 470 kgs to 635 kgs (about 1,034 pounds to 1,397 pounds). Accompanied by a pack of tame steers, they exited the corral just 10 seconds after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. They moved quickly along the 825-meter (902 yard) course, and it took two minutes and 30 seconds until the bulls reached the corrals of the bull ring. The bulls face certain death against matadors in a bullfight later in the day.	1
It's a story that mesmerized the nation and one that many observers thought ended more than two years ago. The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air. In a hearing Thursday, Judge Gerald Fisher, along with an appeals court, maintained restrictions on the media's ability to report on recent hearings in the case. Fisher has ruled that the substantive details of hearings on December 18, January 4 and at least one upcoming hearing remain under seal. When the sealed issues are discussed during the hearings, the lawyers and judge speak at the judge's bench, and observers in the courtroom cannot hear the conversations. The transcripts of those discussions are under seal. The judge's ruling was a disappointment to a group of media outlets, including Associated Press, Gannett, McClatchy, the Washington Post and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that had filed court papers seeking to unseal the information. "We're very disappointed with the court leaving in place essentially blanket secrecy," Patrick Carome, an attorney representing the media outlets, told reporters outside the courthouse. Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months. The man convicted of killing Levy made an appearance at a hearing on Thursday. Ingmar Guandique, 31, was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, sporting a large tattoo that covered most of his scalp. He conversed with a Spanish translator throughout the proceeding, but did not participate in talks at the judge's bench. Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers. "The court has stated that a 'somewhat substantial' but unspecified concern about 'safety' supports its decisions to close the proceedings to all members of the press and the public," according to one court filing. It is not known to whose safety that refers. "This was a terrible crime of violence," said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst. "The witnesses have histories of violence. So there could be violence threatened against any number of people: participants or even outsiders to the case." In addition to the safety concern, Carome said the hearings address "...some information relating to the reliability of the testimony from a government witness."	1
The  Justice Department, as promised, moved Tuesday to block a court ruling  preventing use of government funds for embryonic stem cell  research. The lower-court decision that bars the use of publicly funded stem-cell work had stunned the  Bush administration and the media.The Bush administration had argued that public funding for embryonic stem-cell work was unconstitutional because it  violated the principle of separation of church and state under the Constitution's  First Amendment. The administration also argued that the ban would jeopardize the nation's energy  security, because a large supply of oil may be produced that could not be used to  feed the growing demand for biofuel.In a surprising turn of events, the same judge who ruled  on the government's constitutional claim in the case was also ruling on the Bush administration's  claim that the government's ban on stem-cell work was necessary to  prevent serious damage from an embryonic stem-cell line that had been  obtained illegally. In a 792-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said  that he did not see an "intrinsically compelling interest" in the Bush administration's  policy of preventing the use of federal funds for research on embryonic  stem cells, even if the government had a good legal basis for the policy. The Supreme Court has already ruled twice that federal funding for  embryonic stem-cell research is constitutional, once in 2002, and again in 2005  "to clarify" how states could regulate the use of embryonic stem-cells and their derivatives, such  as fetal-tissue transplants. It also has ruled that the Constitution requires that the federal government  not "subsidize the creation of embryos for the purpose of destroying them, or to  promote their destruction."The Bush administration's use of its own funds for research on embryonic stem-cells appears to be  constitutional because the administration is arguing that the ban, as long as it is not  extended to human embryos (which the federal government is not allowed to create),  is necessary to protect the nation's environment. The Bush administration  has not given up, however, on its claims that the Constitution prevents the  government from providing its funding for research on any forms of human cell  lines, such as embryonic stem cells, which have the potential to be useful for cancer  treatment and other research.In his ruling, Judge Lamberth said he did	0
It was a Friday evening in February when Adrian Vasquez, an 18-year-old from the town of Rio Hato, Panama, accepted an invitation from two friends to accompany them on what was proposed as an overnight fishing expedition. Their plan, according to Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, "was to return the following morning. On February 24, they left from Ensenada Beach in the town of San Carlos aboard a small fishing boat." But the following morning came and went without their return, and the Vasquez family started looking for the 18-year-old and his friends. Arnaldo Vasquez, the teen's father and a hotel worker, asked fishermen to search for them along the shore from which they had departed, and his mother prayed at home with relatives and friends. Soon after, the Panamanian navy joined the search, sending ships and airplanes to look for Vasquez, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, and Fernando Osorio,16. For nearly a month, their fate remained a mystery. But on March 21, fishermen spotted the boat, the Fifty Cents, adrift north of the Galapagos Islands, nearly 600 miles from where it had launched. After being alerted by the fishermen, the Ecuadorian navy rescued the lone crew member. In a statement, Rear Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle said Vasquez showed "severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition." He said the survivor had thrown his friends' bodies into the ocean "because they had become badly decomposed." Vasquez returned Tuesday to Panama City on a commercial flight. According to his mother, he had lost 20 pounds. "After 28 days of anguish, after praying to God that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle," de la Cruz said. She said her son told her the fishing trip had started out well. The three caught plenty of fish. But the boat's engine died without warning and, with no tools and scant navigational experience, there was little the trio could do, de la Cruz told CNN. Soon, currents had swept their boat out into the Pacific, far from the coast. De la Cruz said they ate raw fish and drank rainwater. She did not detail how the other two died. The Ecuadorian navy has said it is not investigating the deaths and considers the incident a rescue operation.	1
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution Monday to send 4,200 peacekeepers to Abyei, Sudan, as part of a recent agreement between Sudan and Southern Sudan. The resolution will establish, for six months, the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), comprising "a maximum of 4,200 military personnel, 50 police personnel, and appropriate civilian support," the resolution states. It passed the council unanimously, 15-0. In a statement released by the State Department, Secretary Hiliary Clinton commended the swift passage of the resolution. "Abyei has been a source of regional tension for many years," the statement said. "We urge the parties to reach an immediate cease-fire and to provide aid workers with the unfettered access required to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict." A week ago, the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement signed an agreement to allow peacekeepers in Abyei, aimed at ending strife that has ravaged much of the country.  The two sides agreed in principle on the need for a third party to monitor the ill-defined border between north and south before the scheduled July 9 independence for the south. The U.N. peacekeepers will "monitor and verify the redeployment of any Sudan Armed Forces, Sudan People's Liberation Army or its successor" from the Abyei area, among other tasks, the Security Council resolution states.	1
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation. "We have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved," announced Christie, showing off the gruff, no-nonsense style that catapulted him into the governor's mansion. It's only fair to mention some tough truths about his speech, his tenure as governor and the state of the Republican campaign for president. The most striking truth (as Democrats pointed out even before the address) is that New Jersey under Christie has suffered from a severely troubled economy and soaring costs of government: the very things that Republicans like Christie blame on Democrats. As of July, New Jersey's unemployment rate stands at 9.8%: higher than the national average, fourth worst among the 50 states and the highest level in 35 years. The rate is higher than on the day Christie took office in 2010 and nearly a full percentage point higher than earlier this year, when Christie's State of the State address exultantly and repeatedly claimed that a "New Jersey Comeback" was under way. And despite Christie's boasts about trimming the cost of government in the Garden State -- the keynote speech repeated his frequent claim of balancing three state budgets -- some fiscal watchdogs attribute the budgets to creative accounting, not true cost containment. "A hard truth Christie absolutely will not tell is that every one of his budgets has been unbalanced by more than $2.5 billion," notes Bloomberg news blogger Josh Barro, citing Christie's bad habit -- started by previous governors -- of skimping on payments into the state's pension fund. This year, for example, Christie paid just over $1 billion into the fund, a record amount but far less than the $3.74 billion that actuaries said was needed, according to Barro. Those unpaid billions are, in effect, a loan that will have to be repaid by taxpayers someday. No wonder Christie omitted "New Jersey Comeback" from his keynote address. Put aside the ugly economics, and Christie's speech was unusually good. He read well from the teleprompter, even though he normally speaks without a prepared text. And he was persuasive, showing off the skills of his old job as a federal prosecutor.	1
Star Wars" makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, who helped create Chewbacca, Yoda, Jabba the Hutt and the otherworldly creatures in the trilogy's famous barroom scene, has died, Lucasfilm said Wednesday. He was 98.  Born May 16, 1911, in Brooklyn, Freeborn joined the U.S. Army in the summer of 1940 at the age of 21, becoming a machine-maker in the National Cash Register Corp. before he began working for Lucasfilm.  During World War II, Freeborn served with the U.S. Navy, where he served as a top-gun, highly skilled Navy test pilot. His wartime job took him to England with Douglas Aircraft in 1942. There, as the head sculptor, his work was used to produce the first-ever U.S. Air Force X-15, an unmanned aircraft that later became the world's first manned vehicle to make a successful unmanned flight.  Freeborn returned to the U.S. with Douglas in 1946, and became one of the most influential designers of the iconic creatures and spaceships that would appear in the film "Star Wars."

The European Union is considering lifting some of its sanctions on Libya, a spokeswoman for the group of nations told CNN Wednesday, a day ahead of a top-level diplomatic summit on post-Gadhafi Libya. Sanctions will remain in place on Moammar Gadhafi Â?s inner circle, but will also be lifted for some oil and gas firms that are not controlled by Gadhafi, the spokeswoman said. The group of nations also has plans to establish new mechanisms to deal with the Libyan crisis. The United States, Britain and France say Gadhafi should be brought to trial for crimes against humanity, but have not ruled out a transition period.WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A U.S. military aircraft shot down during a mission this week struck a Libyan government building, killing Gadhafi's son-in-law, a NATO official said Tuesday. "At this time, there is no indication that Gadhafi was hit in this strike," said NATO spokesman Jeffrey Pool. "However, the cause of this strike remains under investigation." Libyan officials say the building was a military school and was being used to train Gadhafi's opponents. The aircraft, an AC-130 gunship operated by Air Force Special Operations Command, was conducting a "non-lethal" mission to provide cover to allied troops.WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Obama administration has issued draft guidelines for military commanders in Iraq and Syria to better protect U.S. and coalition personnel from improvised explosive devices, a senior administration official said Tuesday. In the wake of the deadly attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, the new guidance is the first of its kind since a similar set of guidelines were issued in July for protection of personnel in Afghanistan, the official said. A U.S. official, who would only speak on background, said that while the new guidelines will provide soldiers and marines greater security and the flexibility to protect themselves, they will not change the legal basis for military operations in Iraq and Syria.WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday with a warning for the Arab world not to "roll back the clock" before an American intervention in Syria. Clinton met Wednesday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the capital of the Palestinian Authority, Ramallah.

The gunbattle was so close it rattled the walls. I grabbed my camera and pointed it out the window, looking toward Independence Square. From more than 10 stories up, I filmed the chaos. Protesters were all around, ramming into the  police, and the police were pushing back."Oh, no," I gasped, realizing that it was the beginning of a street war. The demonstrators were in a standoff with the police, standing shoulder to shoulder, each with a sign. They were holding up the American flag, which had also been taken away from them."You shouldn't have taken it," one of them told me. And then he made a fist, and I realized he was going to punch me. I took my camera out of my bag, pointed it at him, and shot a shot-out. Then I ran out of there, and I didn't come back for a week.I was in Washington, D.C., doing a television show about politics. We were in the middle of a gunbattle with protesters. The cops were firing. Then, on my first day, a policeman punched me in the face.I saw it happen. I ran over to tell my producer, but he was in the middle of interviewing a guy who was the mayor of D.C. He was looking down, holding a microphone in one hand and telling some politician that he was going to have me fired.We went outside and the politician had his camera crew with him. The politician grabbed my hand and told me, "Don't let the press get you." He said I had done nothing wrong.I looked in the politician's eyes and I saw that he had never laid a hand on me in my life, and he never would. But he was a politician, and he said he was going to fire me—just because. I should have just taken the hit and run. Instead I took the hit and the run.We got up, and I told my producer the story. The politician stood there, stunned. He said that he'd never laid a hand on me. And then he threw a punch. He said that I had threatened him by saying I could make that man mayor of Washington. He had no idea I was a comedian.The comedian in me had said, "We're going to tear that guy apart!" And I didn't. I got away. I	0
When I was driving through Poland last year, all the talk was about a Chinese company's failure to complete a major motorway project. The contract was wrestled away from the Chinese and the Poles finished it themselves. The details, denials and vernacular explanations varied. But the simple fact was that the Poles did the job themselves and the Chinese were forced to do the work to complete the contract on a time-scale that was unacceptable to the Chinese. No sooner had the news spread through the Chinese diplomatic mission in Warsaw than a representative of that company appeared at the Warsaw airport with a Chinese delegation. He was welcomed by Chinese diplomats and presented with a huge bouquet of flowers from which he promptly took his leave.The story was one of a Chinese company's having no political will to fulfil a contract that had been awarded to it in good faith.A few years ago, I flew into Warsaw on a Chinese plane. The two-hour journey from Beijing took less than twenty-four hours to complete. The Polish government had invested a huge sum of money in building a new Chinese cultural centre. I asked the officials why it wasn't completed. I was told this:**(a)** It had a Chinese manager in it, whose nationality was not Polish.**(b)** Poland had made a secret deal with the Chinese to complete the building, subject to a time frame acceptable to China.**(c)** The Chinese had not fulfilled the requirements of the treaty.**(d)** We had signed a letter of intent in 2005, but had not fully agreed certain details, which had to be resolved.**(e)** The Polish prime minister had not approved the project in its entirety.I had a meeting with the minister of culture, who was clearly out of his depth. After he had given me a lecture explaining that "everything is in strict accordance with international law", I left.It was the first time I had seen such a scenario play out. Although my Chinese friend said the Chinese had accepted the agreement in principle, it was still not an agreement in principle.The key thing is that there is no such thing as a deal in principle. In the end, everything goes through the political process.That's why the Chinese did not rush to complete the building in the way I was told it was being completed. Because this was a Chinese project	0
Richard Serra stands in the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, his hair as white as the marble floor. The summer sun of New York radiates from the towering metal of his monumental works.  His voice is quiet, almost inaudible. "I saw something I wanted to do in the past," he says. "Somewhere, there must be a connection."Serra has never fully revealed his reason for creating The Gates of Palestine, a towering sculpture, an enormous mural and an installation that has been on the drawing board since the early 1980s."It's not something that I've been working on," he says. "It's not something that I've been exploring. It's not a work that I've been thinking about for long periods of time. I don't know if the subject came into my mind or if I'm actually doing it. What I know is that I want it."For the past 30 years, Serra has been making his mark. The Gates of Palestine is his most important and controversial work. Its location at the Museum of Modern Art could not be more fitting, since the museum is both the repository of Serra's work and the location for that work's installation."It's important that the project moves the museum, or the community, or the city, rather, for the project to exist," Serra says. "This is a very bold move."Serra has created a massive piece that resembles a wall, a giant sculpture that is not, however, a wall. Its entire exterior is painted a light shade of blue. The sculpture is a six-foot-tall mural that appears to be a wall. It is comprised of approximately 300,000 square feet of painted canvas with a canvas covering the wall, the floor and the roof. The installation is intended to stretch across the entire museum and span the entire length of the long axis of the building. The installation is approximately 6,000 square feet in area and 4,000 feet long.Serra says that the project will have four functions, and that the first, the first to the fourth, will be revealed in 2013. The first is a visual element that is projected onto the back wall of the museum and onto the sculpture and the second will be a audio audio installation."One is visual and the other is audio, but they're both one	0
A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage, the Navy said. The submarine USS  broke in half. The American destroyer USS Cole, which was escorting the submarine, was damaged.Officials said that the U.S. ship was headed for the Gulf of Aden to collect oil, and the Navy’s 6th Fleet ordered it to sail to Bahrain for repair.The collision in the narrow strait between Iran and several small islands in the Persian Gulf was the latest crisis in tensions already strained by Iran’s nuclear program and its support of terrorist groups that the West believes use the Strait for attacks on U.S. and other ships.Navy Chief Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael T. Davis told reporters in the Pentagon that the Navy was investigating the cause of the accident. He said the captain on board the submarine, Robert P. Tardiff, had been relieved. He said Tardiff remained aboard the ship and was being examined.Navy officials said Friday that the crash had “caused no injuries.” The USS Cole, which was a destroyer, was a missile carrier and was escorting a U.S. submersible that was conducting an inspection of a suspected Iranian buildup of mines and minesweeping equipment on the Gulf’s seabed, according to the Navy.A spokesman for the U.S. Navy in Bahrain said that the accident caused some damage to the Iranian navy vessel and the U.S. submersible and would be investigated. But he said the Navy was continuing to assess the damage.The Navy said damage was minor, and no injuries were reported.The USS Thresher collided with the  while conducting normal operations in the Straits of Hormuz about 90 miles southwest of Iran’s territorial waters.The White House said President Barack Obama called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Friday morning and expressed his condolences for the crash.“The president has been in touch with the Iranian government since the start of the crisis and was informed of the Iranian response to the incident,” the White House said in a statement.Ahmadinejad was not available for an interview, a spokesman for the Iranian president	0
Oh Bob Dylan, how can the life of such a man be in the palm of some advertiser's hand? Be sure to sing that first line to the tune of Dylan's classic song "Hurricane" and you'll get why it fits. The vernacular used in a song can convey a vast range of meanings. A lyric I've always found particularly interesting is "He's been on the road so long, he was supposed to be on the road." This, to me, sounds like a signifier for the end of his career. And then there's this gem, from one of his songs: "If you've never been on the road, then you don't understand what I'm sayin'." It seems very much like a line written by a young man just out of the army, who understands perfectly that the life he's been leading has been something out of his control. So far, so typical. But the problem is if Dylan is saying just what you think he is saying, then the line becomes a classic example of how to get you to buy something, to get you to buy what the advertiser wants you to pay for.When we start speaking of ads, or songs, or TV shows, we tend to think of them as being in the sphere of ideas, of information. In fact, they are largely in the sphere of power. If you don't buy the brand of car they are selling, you will be taken into the sphere of power and forced to buy products that represent a different brand. In the old days, the advertiser had to advertise a product in the form it appeared in the newspaper. Now, with TV, the advertiser has free rein to present his product in whatever shape or form he feels he needs to (within the constraints of FCC regulations). The ads are there to manipulate the mind or to sell the product, and thus to manipulate the consumer. And there is not much difference between the two, from a political point of view.Once information becomes power it is hard to determine where to draw the line between what is advertising and what is not. To what extent should an advertisement be allowed to make the consumer think? The most famous case of the adman making a consumer think was when an advertisement showed up on the side of the buses, showing a young woman giving her new car to her boyfriend: "Don't drive with a man like this." As the slogan says, "Show him the	0
A former high school teacher in Freeland, Michigan, has been arraigned in two counties on 29 counts of sexual misconduct with an underage student, a Midland County prosecutor said Wednesday. Marcie Rousseau, a 33-year-old married mother of two, is accused of having sex with a then-16-year-old student from May 2009 to February, according to prosecutor Angelina Scarpelli. There could be two other alleged victims dating back to 2002, Scarpelli told HLN's "Prime News." Rousseau was placed on administrative leave February 16 while police investigated the allegations. She officially resigned from her teaching job at Freeland High School on June 16, Scarpelli said. She was arraigned Monday in Saginaw County on 21 counts of criminal sexual conduct, and in Midland County on Tuesday on eight counts of criminal sexual conduct, Scarpelli said. Rousseau picked the boy up in her car and drove across county lines to have sex with him, Scarpelli said. Rousseau entered not guilty pleas to the charges this week, Scarpelli said. Rousseau, who was released on bond Tuesday, is the latest in a spate of recent highly publicized cases of teachers accused of having sex with students. Broward County, Florida, teacher Kristen Sullivan, 25, was arrested April 20 for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old student, and Tampa, Florida, teacher Stephanie Ragusa was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for sexual relationships with two underage students in 2008. "We're finally realizing not only that sexual assault exists and how prevalent it is, but there is such a thing as a female perpetrator," Robin Sax, a former prosecutor and author of "Predators and Molesters," told "Prime News." CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.	1
Military forces have managed to take the remaining strongholds of al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in the far northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the military said. "In effect, operations will now focus on the environs of the city and policing within the liberated areas," the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said in a statement, adding that its troops worked with Transitional Federal Government forces. "Our joint operations have gone extremely well today and over the weekend," AMISOM spokesman Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda said.  "Casualties have been thankfully very low on our side, with just one killed and six minor injuries.  The outer north and eastern fringes of the city must still be cleared, but key ground and buildings are no longer under the control of the extremists." "It has been a big achievement to remove Al-Shabaab from the city, and put an end to the fighting that disrupted so many lives.  But the challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives." Last week Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide truck bombing in the heart of Mogadishu that left dozens dead. Other Al-Shabaab attacks last week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. Al-Shabaab was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. The group is waging a war against Somalia's government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe Al-Shabaab has been severely weakened by AMISOM, targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al Qaeda. Al-Shabaab said in August that it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and the Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now control most districts of the capital city, the United Nations office said. Forces have pushed Al-Shabaab outside most of Mogadishu, but the group is still a major threat, said African Union forces spokesman Lt. Col. Paddy Nkunda in a statement last week.	1
Bodies torn apart by the weapons of war. The bloody corpse of a man hit by shelling as he walked under trees, a shopkeeper's mutilated body in front of her store, a broom lying nearby. Some three months after pro-Russian rebels declared an independent "Donetsk People's Republic," Ukrainian government forces are encircling the city of Donetsk. Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie was in the city in May and returned two weeks ago to find it battle-scarred and slowly draining of life as its people flee. The images he has captured show the anguish of the immediate aftermath of shelling -- the relatives of victims, people left homeless, the dead. Others depict those left behind sheltering in Soviet or WWII-era cellars and boarded-up buildings as their homes are engulfed by the conflict. The photographs, many too graphic to show here, leave no doubt about the true horror of the destructive conflict. "If you go north of the city towards the airport you have entire areas that are no-man's land -- they are not controlled by anybody and they are being shelled daily ... with mortars and tanks," Alpeyrie tells CNN. "You see some families that have remained there -- mostly elders and a lot of people that don't really have any money, they have to stay. You also get people who stay because they don't want to leave their homes. It's been their family home for a long time and they have their belongings inside, so they want to stay close to that. "You do have a lot of elders who are pretty tough and they're very pro-Russian, so for them that's also their struggle but a lot of them are hoping that this will end quickly." The center of Donetsk, in peacetime much like any other modern city, is less damaged, though suffering from water shortages and largely shut down, he says, abandoned by an estimated half of Donetsk's population of around one million. "People do get killed. If you're walking down the street it's like a lottery, you just don't know," Alpeyrie says. The day before Alpeyrie spoke to CNN, the group he was with -- fellow photographers and a local driver/translator -- had almost been killed in the town of Marynivka. Four people died nearby.	1
Ten years ago I was one of a small number of UK lawyers who opposed the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that it was illegal and unauthorised by the United Nations. We were all strong advocates of the notion that the rule of law  should precede military action. And it was then that I felt a sense of duty. I believed that Iraq was clearly the wrong thing to do. I felt there were no other options. But, to say that we should not have taken military action is not the same as saying we should have left Iraq well alone and allowed it to disintegrate in the face of the inevitable sectarian violence that would result from a brutal regime.I had always been one of those people who believed that the purpose of law is to protect and ensure justice. We were not there to serve any other reason. We had to be sure that the law as we thought it operated was consistent with our belief, and that it could deliver justice. If there was ever any doubt about that, we now know that it was right to go to war. No matter that Saddam Hussein was, in the words of the then Secretary-General, "a brutal dictator who persecuted his own people". That is no reason to give him what he so obviously wanted: the ability, for one person and one regime, to impose his will on the entire region and the world. The argument in favour of the invasion was an even more compelling one than the one for going to war with Iraq in 2003. The arguments against continued to be based on what we had seen on television, what we could see from the air that was monitoring Iraq before we went. The arguments in favour of invasion were based on the fact that Saddam was a clear and present danger, that we were not about to leave any part of the world defenceless in the face of such an awful threat, and that we, as a Western democracy, had a duty to act where necessary to protect those in other countries from what we believed to be evil and threatening behaviour. In short, it was not just those who wanted the invasion of Iraq who considered it wrong. The arguments for the invasion were as compelling as those against. We needed to know what was on the other side of this conflict, in order to assess what it meant to our international security.I came to that position after reading a book called The Case for a New World Order. I was particularly struck by Chapter 18, which argued that "the most immediate	0
The contention that President Obama apologized to other nations for American behavior has been mentioned repeatedly by his critics, including Mitt Romney. During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August, Romney said, "I will begin my presidency with the jobs tour. President Obama began his with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President America has freed other nations from dictators." At last week's debate that "President Obama's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour." Romney made the claim again during the Monday night debate. "The president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America." CNN Fact Check: Obama's China tire case Romney also said the "reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.  And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations." Romney said "in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.  You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations." Obama said the apologizing claim "has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign." The facts: When President Obama began his term, he made a number of speeches in the Middle East and elsewhere -- all designed to forge better ties with Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Critics such as Romney have said Obama apologized for past actions in such addresses. Obama did indeed mention past U.S. flaws in speeches. But in those addresses, Obama never uttered an apology for the United States. Those statements were snippets, part of larger and grander narratives about repairing ties, building friendship and working together. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq During an address in Strasbourg, France, in April 2009, Obama did utter words Romney referenced in the debate. In that speech, Obama said, "there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But in the very next sentence, Obama called out the Europeans for an "anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad."	1

Airline passengers are already able to check in to flights, download boarding passes, select a seat on the go and keep an eye on the upgrades list thanks to recent evolutions in smartphone technology, and the options just keep growing. Â As of last week, you can now check in via voice recognition in the seatback video screens in many airplanes while you’re in the boarding area. Â Another recent innovation is that the in-flight entertainment system is now able to change screens for an interactive flight attendant screen and the seatback screen at selected points in the flight, or even during takeoff and landing. Â As you can imagine, the possibilities are boundless!Â When flying from New York to London via Singapore with British Airways, I could check in via voice recognition, download boarding passes via my iPhone, choose my seats with my Android phone, update my reservation status with the in-flight inflight connectivity (I use Kayak.com) and even check my flight status right there on my screen on the plane via the in-flight connectivity. Â I also could stream a movie from the in-flight entertainment system to my iPhone via the in-flight connectivity, and I could even start the in-flight movie in the seatback screen if I hadn’t done so on the plane yet. You can find more examples of the innovative features airlines are introducing via Kayak’s Travel Trends database.”As our collective flying knowledge about airlines continues to grow, we are sure to see more innovative features added to our flying experience.The good news is that, while you may not be able to bring your iPad on an airplane, you can use your iPhone or Android phone as an excellent travel companion while you’re boarding the plane.To get the full benefit of this new technology, use the onboard WiFi to download an Internet book and/or a movie. As I did while boarding a Delta Airlines flight back in April, I was able to sit back on the leather seat (or in the seatback video screen) for a few minutes and read a book without missing a single step of the boarding process. I am still a loyal Delta passenger, so I was able to download the free Kindle book, The Big Picture : The Art of Storytelling.Of course, when I was able to get my iPhone onboard, I was able to browse the online travel guide and my iPhone could watch movies that	0
The mother of a 15-year-old girl who appeared on "The Tyra Show" as a self-described sex addict is suing the daytime talk show host for up to $3 million, claiming the show flew the girl, Jewel Ciera Washington, to New York and put her on TV without parental consent or the proper work papers required by the state of Georgia. "It's like I'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down, like I'm a prisoner," Washington said on the TV show. "I know that I need help for this. ... I know it for a fact," she added. The lawsuit, filed October 8 in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, by Beverly McClendon, says written consent and an employment certificate must be obtained before a minor can be "employed as a performer in a television production ... [and] the minor will not be used for pornographic purposes." According to McClendon's attorneys, Wanda Jackson and George Lawson, "the sole intent of the Defendants programming was to increase ratings in order to gain advertising revenue." McClendon's attorneys claim "both Plaintiffs [McClendon and Washington] have been harmed and have received injury ... to their health and well-being " as a result of the alleged violations and alleged negligence by the TV show host and program, its executive producers and Warner Bros. Entertainment. Washington appeared on the now-defunct program in October 2009. Scott Rowe, senior vice president of worldwide communications for Warner Bros. Television Group, told CNN Entertainment that the company is "not commenting at this time." Calls to McClendon and her lawyers have not been returned. The defendants have not answered the complaint. No court date has been set. Warner Bros. Entertainment, one of the defendants in McClendon's lawsuit, is a division of Time Warner, which is the parent company of CNN and "In Session," which airs on truTV. In Session's Jessica Thill and HLN's Kaylin Rocco contributed to this report.	1
A new sleeper virus that could allow hackers to steal financial and personal information has now spread to more than eight million computers in what industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen. Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. The Downadup or Conficker worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, where -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it potentially exposes infected PCs to hijack. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure, says while the purpose of the worm is unclear, its unique "phone home" design, linking back to its point of origin, means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc. He said his company had reverse-engineered its program, which they suspected of originating in Ukraine, and is using the call-back mechanism to monitor an exponential infection rate, despite Microsoft's issuing of a patch to fix the bug. "On Tuesday there were 2.5 million, on Wednesday 3.5 million and today [Friday], eight million," he told CNN. "It's getting worse, not better." Hypponen explained to CNN the dangers that Downadup poses, who is most at risk and what can be done to stop its spread. How serious is it? It is the most serious large scale worm outbreak we have seen in recent years because of how widespread it is, but it is not very serious in terms of what it does. So far it doesn't try to steal personal information or credit card details. Who is affected? We have large infections in Europe, the United States and in Asia. It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks. There are very few reports of independent home computers affected. What does it do? It is a complicated worm most likely engineered by a group of people who have spent time making it very complicated to analyze and remove. The real reason why they have created it is hard to say right now, but we do know how it replicates. How does it spread?	1
A South Korean court on Thursday sentenced the captain of a Chinese fishing boat to 30 years in prison for murdering a South Korean coast guard officer during a confrontation in the Yellow Sea last year. The ilya, which is owned by a Taiwan-based group, was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor for manslaughter and negligent homicide before being ordered to pay a fine of 30 million won ($26,500).The ilya sank the South Korean coast guard boat the North Korea Coast Guard cutter Hyeongseong on March 21, according to the South Korean coast guard. In addition to the loss of life of the South Korean coast guard, the court also ordered the captain of the ilya to pay a 200,000 won fine and to serve a six-year supervised re-education term.Following the sinking, a South Korean court sentenced two North Korean fishermen in May to 20 years of hard labor for committing a similar act and their boat was held under maritime arrest for 10 months. That sentence was overturned on appeal. It is believed the North Korean fishermen were convicted for having committed a serious offense such as illegal fishing, even though no offense was committed but rather a case of mistaken identity.In July, North Korea detained a South Korean fisherman, Kang Ok-chul, and sentenced him to three years of hard labor for committing “illegally fishing” in waters off the country.The ship ilya was sailing between the South Korean and Chinese ports of Busan and Kaesong when the incident occurred. The coast guard’s chief said the boat was fishing illegally for several days before the incident and that it appeared undockable.South Korean defense ministry officials told Yonhap that the country's coast guard had “no immediate information that anything untoward occurred in the area.”The ilya incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries. In late January, a North Korean fishing boat collided with South Korean ships near a disputed island, triggering the first such incident between the two countries in more than two years. The collision forced the South Korean navy to deploy naval ships in the area. The South Korean ship hit the North Korean vessel while they were sailing southbound. The North Korean fishing boat had just returned from the disputed territory.In that incident, the fisherman reported that after the vessel began its voyage, it was attacked by a North Korean boat and a	0
The mother of a 19-year-old accused of killing two people and himself at a Maryland mall told reporters that her son was a "gentle, sweet kid." In the conversation, recorded Sunday by a reporter for radio station WNEW, the woman says Darion Aguilar never had a gun before and was a gentle teenager. "If you were to go into his room you would see what a gentle, sweet kid he was," she says. She says she cannot understand what happened and that she doesn't think her 19-year-old son knew the victims. She adds that she feels for the parents of 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson, who were shot dead with a shotgun on Saturday morning at the busy Columbia mall. ABC also reported the mother's comments. The woman's revelations come as police look into a journal written by Aguilar. The diary contains typical teenage writings about acne and rejection by girls, but nothing to indicate he was depressed, a family friend said Monday. Family friend Ellis Cropper, who is serving as a spokesman for Aguilar's mother, told CNN on Monday that police reviewed the journal after the mother called police to file a missing person report. Cropper said Aguilar's mother, with whom he was close, doesn't think he was dating anyone. Police have said only that  Aguilar's  journal expressed "general unhappiness with his life." According to police, Aguilar took a taxi to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday morning and then fired as many as nine shots from a Mossberg 500 shotgun into a skateboard apparel shop, killing Benlolo and Johnson before fatally shooting himself. On Saturday, a federal official briefed on the shooting told CNN that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at the two victims, perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree. Police have offered no motive for the shooting. "I know there's a lot of interest in the motive for this, and I have as much interest in that as anybody," Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said Sunday. Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, Cropper said. As of now that's the only known link between him and the skate shop. Prelude to the shooting According to Cropper, here's what Aguilar's mother says happened before the shooting on Saturday:	1
The chairman of India's UB Group, which includes Bangalore-based Kingfisher Airlines and United Breweries, made the winning $1.8 million bid on a number of Mahatma Gandhi's personal items on auction. Mahatma Gandhi was known  to collect a lot of things including jewelry, trinkets, books, paintings, and even furniture during his life and post-retirement.Gandhi, who was assassinated by Nathuram Godse in 1948, spent his life in India but had a series of personal residences in North America and Europe.There is a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi with his son Shashtri Gandhi and Gandhi's granddaughter Sandhya on the wall of a small room. A portrait of Mahatma Gandhi with his son Shashtri Gandhi and Gandhi's granddaughter-in-law Sandhya on the wall of a small room. He has at least three portraits on his walls.All India Radio broadcast a series of lectures on Mahatma Gandhi's life and philosophy and his struggle for India's independence from British rule.The auction house is seeking to auction off Gandhi's personal items including manuscripts, paintings, personal items and his belongings. The items will be part of the Mahatma Gandhi Heritage Collection that will be housed at the UB Group office at 12, Ram Krishna Nagar, Bangalore.He has so far not responded, but he did make a statement late on Saturday, saying, "In my personal opinion, my death should have been a natural death, or at least a natural dying".He would turn 95 on January 14, 1992. Gandhi was cremated after his death in September 1948 and his ashes were buried in a pauper's grave.The Mahatma Statue at the University of Mumbai was built on the lines of Gandhi's statue in Delhi, and Gandhi supporters are hoping that the statue at the University of Mumbai, will be a similar to Gandhi's statue at the University of Delhi.On a personal note, I don't know how many of you all know this but, I am so grateful for all the support I have been getting in my fight against cancer. To my supporters who have reached out to me - thank-you. Please continue to share the love and support you give.I am glad to see this new movement and hope its a success.

It was a mother's worst nightmare. On March 31, 2014, at 11 p.m., I received a phone call from my 25-year-old son. "Mom. I got lost, made a wrong turn and ended up at the Mexico border. I've been surrounded by military, and I need you to know in case anything happens to me." On April 1, I received another phone call. "Mom, I've been arrested. Please get me an attorney," Andrew said. It was the most frightening call of my life -- worse than the call from Afghanistan as my son explained, "We have just been hit by an IED." The call from La Mesa Prison in Tijuana, Mexico, three days later went this way: "Mom, I am not going to make it through the night. Whatever you do, do not come down here and ask questions or do an investigation as you will be killed as well." As Independence Day comes and goes this year, it is bittersweet to think about my son being bound by a felony arrest in a foreign country while we try to navigate a foreign judicial system. To think about my son, vibrant and ambitious, being held in the bondage of incarceration is inconceivable. This young man who valiantly fought for the freedom of others, willing to die to combat the evil of oppression and violence in two tours in Afghanistan, meritoriously promoted to sergeant on the battlefield in 2012 -- and now he is languishing in a Mexican penitentiary and experiencing captivity for the first time, as a result of one wrong turn. It is simply staggering. He has been incarcerated since April 1, for inadvertently crossing the border with legally purchased firearms. This separation is by far more traumatic than the combat tours. Marine 'optimistic' he'll soon be released In Afghanistan, he had his Marine Corps brothers who always had his back. I feel like our executive branch has abandoned him, and it feels totally inhumane. The White House has not responded to us despite our petition on Whitehouse.gov, which has nearly 130,000 signatures. The White House says it will respond to petitions that get 100,000 signatures in 30 days. On a trip to Mexico in May, Secretary of State John Kerry "raised the issue" with authorities there. I am outraged. Andrew's situation should be considered a grave, serious and urgent concern.	1
Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi plans to form a new political party aimed at reining in the power of the Islamic Republic's leadership, a leading reformist newspaper reported Sunday. Mir Hossein Moussavi is reportedly seeking to form a new political party in Iran. Moussavi told supporters the party will be focused on upholding "the remaining principles of the constitution," according to Etemad-e Melli, a newspaper aligned with fellow opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi. He is expected to file papers with Iran's Interior Ministry to establish the party before hard-line incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is sworn in for a new term, the newspaper reported. The announcement comes after weeks of protests over Iran's disputed presidential election and an attempted clampdown by Iran's clerical leadership. The clerical leadership has declared Ahmadinejad the winner of that vote. Moussavi, a former prime minister, was the leading challenger to Ahmadinejad in the June 12 balloting. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning with more than 62 percent of the vote. Moussavi and Karrubi have consistently rejected those results as fraudulent and demanded a new vote. Their supporters turned out in crowds estimated in the hundreds of thousands to demand the results be overturned. Iran's Guardian Council, which oversees the elections, has declared the official count will stand.	1
Facebook says it was recently hacked, though it says no data about its more than a billion users was compromised. The company described the "sophisticated attack" in a blog post on Friday, saying it took place in January when a small number of employees visited a compromised website that installed malware on their machines. "As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement and began a significant investigation that continues to this day," Facebook Security said in the post. Facebook, the largest social network in the world, is the latest high-profile site to be hacked this year. Twitter announced a similar intrusion earlier this month, and major news organizations including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post have also admitted to being hacked. The news sites attributed the breaches to hackers working for the Chinese government, but neither Facebook nor Twitter mention China when describing their attacks. "Facebook was not alone in this attack. It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well," said the blog post. "As one of the first companies to discover this malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected. " Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it has found no evidence that any user information was compromised. Twitter said that user names, encrypted passwords and e-mail addresses for as many as 250,000 users were potentially grabbed by the hackers. It reset passwords for all affected accounts. The string of hacks have primarily exploited vulnerabilities in the programming language Java, which is installed on most computers by default. Facebook said the site responsible for its attack took advantage of a previously unknown Java vulnerability, which Oracle patched on February 1. In January, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert about the security-challenged software and recommended people turn it off on their computers. Apple turned off Java by default for its OS X users as a precaution. Full instructions on how to disable Java on any computer can be found on Oracle's website. If you must use Java, make sure that you have downloaded the latest updates, which include key security patches. Facebook said it will continue to work with law enforcement and others in the industry to prevent future attacks.	1
The scene was somber, sullen and mostly silent outside the Turkish coal mine. But every so often, the grief came out loud and clear. "Enough for the life for me!" yelled one woman -- her arms flailing, tears running down her cheeks -- according to video from Turkish broadcaster DHA. "Let this mine take my life, too!" As she was pulled away, she added, "Enough is enough." Sadly, the torment for her and many others isn't over. Yes, rescuers did save at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up Tuesday during shift change at the mine in the western Turkish city of Soma, sparking a choking fire deep inside. But another 274 are known dead, according to Turkey's Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate. Those who underwent autopsies died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said. There is every expectation that number will grow. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine, though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd. As helicopters buzzed overheard and flags flew at half-staff, police and rescue workers were everywhere on the scene Wednesday night. But for most, there was precious little they could do. The smoke rose from openings in the ground showed the continuing dangers both to those trapped and anyone who dared try to get them. Rescue volunteer Mustafa Gursoy told the CNN team at the mine that conditions inside the mine were abominable -- hot, smoky and filled with carbon monoxide. Authorities worked to pump in good air into the mine, so they could get in. However, as Davitt McAteer, a former top U.S. mine safety official points out, sending in oxygen likely would "increase the likelihood that the fire would grow and continue to put those miners at risk." These stiff challenges notwithstanding, rescuers haven't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air. "If they could reach those emergency rooms and reach their gas masks and close the doors and protect those emergency areas from the poison gas, then they could survive," Gursoy said. "It's possible. We are ready for anything." But Yildiz, speaking earlier, said "hopes are diminishing" of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine.	1
An estimated 13,000 Congolese civilians threatened by fierce fighting and gruesome attacks have fled to neighboring Uganda over the past  days.  On Wednesday, a  group of at least seven armed men  in the Congo's south-central Kasai  region fired on a car  carrying an unknown number of people,  killing a young woman and four children.  The attack was  quickly followed by two more car jackings  near the Kibumba town.  The Congolese Army is accused of  shelling the two villages, and a militia  calling itself the People's Liberation Army (SLAP) claimed responsibility for the abductions.The UN says that  at least 13,000  civilians are fleeing  to Uganda and South Sudan, where they are being  accommodated at refugee camps in Kampala and in the war-torn  Sudan.There is a lack of precise figures,  but the UNHCR estimates that  20,000 people have fled from the Democratic Republic of Congo since Aug.  12, the day before rebels began seizing power in the  capital.  Last week, a  UN aid worker and aid workers on a mission of  peace were among the hundreds of people who fled  the country to Uganda during the week before the country's military started invading the eastern provinces."I didn't really plan  for this to happen,"  said one victim who escaped on Wednesday. "I was just trying to get out of the  city when a car drove next to me and I was  shot and killed," he told the  Associated Press. "I don't know  how my friends are, I don't know  where they are. I don't know if they're dead or alive."The UN is trying to help residents of the Kasai  region to leave, by providing them with  food, water and medical support, but the United  States and African leaders have both called on  the government to let the people flee their homes.Meanwhile,  hundreds of Congolese civilians and rebels fighting  for control of the war-torn country are killed  each week.The United States and  European governments have expressed alarm at  the  killings, which they accuse the rebels of carrying out at the order  of their own top leadership.The United States  has  suspended aid to the rebel groups  involved in the fighting and called onPresident Joseph Kabila to allow	0
A Libyan revolutionary fighters' convoy came under attack Saturday on the outskirts of Sirte, the birthplace of Moammar addafi, at the time of the Benghazi attack, according to local news reports.The convoy of several trucks and cars carrying fighters, which the Libyan Revolutionaries Army (LRA) has been carrying out in Sirte, came under "a hail of small arms," according to local news reports.A group of civilians, including women, were reportedly killed during the attack on the LRA convoy near Sirte."Some people have been killed. You know the Libyan Revolutionaries Army is not a normal army," a news channel reported.After being hit by the attack, the convoy took off after firing rockets in the air to try to get their attacker, the AFP news agency reported.While the LRA's operation against forces loyal to ousted Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has continued for several months, there have been reports of attacks by the Islamists against civilian targets and vehicles in Benghazi.After an anti-Gaddafi protester drove a pick-up truck into a crowd near the capital on Monday, there were more reports of attacks against civilian targets in the city.On Wednesday, Islamist fighters in the city set fire to more than 50 cars and burned down a car park that resulted in the deaths of two people, according to witnesses.A Libyan military officer confirmed to Reuters that the military had "conducted operations against the terrorists to protect civilians, especially women and children."The officer added that the operation had resulted in a "victory" for the Libyan army."We made sure they [the gunmen] did not enter the capital," said army officer Abdel Hakim al-Hassi, adding that "in each incident we managed to kill or capture some of the terrorists."Al-Hassi said that he had received information that the gunmen would be trying to enter Benghazi anyway, so there was no point in preventing them."We want to warn the citizens in Benghazi, particularly those who may be travelling at night, to stay at home," al-Hassi told Reuters.Libyan television also broke down the LRA operations against civilian targets in Benghazi."The LRA, their operations against women, children and the elderly in Benghazi and the cities are continuing, without a doubt it is part of a policy of the L	0
Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform. The next possible launch attempt is at 5:09 a.m. ET Friday, NASA said via Twitter, "pending resolution of the issue." NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land. "During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort. Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look," said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications. The thrust vector control actuators are used to steer the rocket in flight. The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the International Space Station -- to the desired orbit. SpaceX's attempt to land the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage has been the chief focus of interest ahead of its latest resupply mission. Recycling rockets Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean. The millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn, too. SpaceX wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. "A fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access," SpaceX said in a statement. The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9's first stage on water. Those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. In those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket unusable. That was according to plan, SpaceX said. Landing on a moving target When the launch happens, the company will try the same soft landing for the Falcon 9's first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Landing on the platform "is significantly more challenging" than the water landings, the company said. For one, the platform is not anchored, and while it looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the 14-story-tall rocket.	1
Lawyers for former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted on multiple counts of child sex abuse, argued a motion for a new trial Thursday. Judge John Cleland, who presided over Sandusky's conviction and sentencing, granted the motion, but said the jury instructions for the case were "harsh" and "not a model of clarity." The lawyers say the instructions were unclear that they did not have to consider all of the evidence. The judge said he would not retry Sandusky.The man who shot up the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin over the recent weekend has been identified as a Wisconsin college student named Andrew Cancro. Cancro posted a video on Youtube that shows him firing into the crowd of roughly 100 people that had gathered to protest the shooting, which is believed to have taken place Saturday night. His motivation is yet unknown. Cancro is a member of the Sikh religion, which makes no distinction between the peaceful observant and the terrorists that seek to destroy it for the sake of "religious freedom."The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a New Jersey request yesterday for early release on probation for a man who was convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison. The Court said that the 6 feet, 10 inches tall and 185 pounds, Robert E. Byrd should serve his sentence and wait six months before becoming eligible for parole. The high court said that the sentence "was the result of careful consideration of the relevant sentencing objectives of punishment and deterrence."A North Carolina man was sentenced Wednesday to just 12 years in prison for assaulting a police officer in a hit-and-run accident. Richard Thompson had pleaded guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide, while the prosecution's evidence showed that he struck a police cruiser near Charlotte, N.C. The officer, who was in the back of a cruiser, tried to pull Thompson over for making a turn and failed. A federal judge has ordered a man to perform community service with the Department of Justice for illegally accessing a National Guard database and mailing military documents, reports Courthouse News Service from Washington. The man, who is identified as Daniel James, has been charged with improperly accessing military personnel records over a three-year period while he was a civilian. The charges stem from his illegal access to the database and mailing of confidential documents from the Army and Marine Corps. He accessed the database on the federal government's computer network	0
Three days after Syrian government forces seized control of the strategically important city of Qusayr, aid workers remained unable Saturday to enter the region, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. "As of today, ICRC still doesn't have permission to enter Qusayr region and will continue to make all efforts to obtain access as and when security allows," spokesman Ewan Watson said in a statement. The U.N. Security Council had urged on Friday that Syrian authorities let humanitarian reach the town. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said this week that it had received reports that as many as 1,500 wounded civilians were trapped in Qusayr, which endured nearly seven weeks of fighting until government forces gained control on Wednesday. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that almost 600 of the wounded were unable to walk. Many were trapped in narrow areas near the city, the network said. The ICRC said that, over the past two days, the Lebanese Red Cross transferred 39 Syrians to receive emergency medical care. The casualties were already on Lebanese territory and were not taken across the border by the Red Cross, Watson said. In the village of Eastern Bowaiyda in Homs province, where many of those displaced by fighting in al Qusayr have sought shelter, clashes erupted between rebels and Syrian troops after the government forces tried to latter attempted to advance on the area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Saturday that the army had restored stability to the region. Most of those who fled Qusayr to Lebanon are women and children. "Those we have spoken to say it is unsafe to flee with men, who are at heightened risk of being arrested or killed at checkpoints along the way," said Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s refugee agency, earlier this week. Fleming said one woman told the agency that Qusayr residents were facing a stark choice: "You leave and risk being killed ... or you stay and face a certainty of being killed." Fighters from Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran and the Syrian government, were involved in the takeover. The loss of what had been a rebel stronghold near the Lebanese border represented a blow to rebels' efforts to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and may portend heightened sectarian tensions.	1
Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less. More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says _____.Read another version of this article on NBCNews.com.When it comes to eating a balanced diet, eating out is always a factor, says Robert W. Yolken, DPM, MMS, who is president of Yolken, Yolken and Associates, in New Orleans. It's not just at McDonald's or Burger King where someone else is making decisions for you, he says."You have to do it yourself," Yolken says. "That's what I tell my clients — do not order your food at a restaurant. A person can read a menu and understand what is available to him or her, but it doesn't mean he or she necessarily will make the best decision."But there's good news on the economic front. Restaurant sales are down, and those people are likely to be healthier, according to Gary Hamel, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association."It may be a reason to have a few more restaurants in the market place," he says.And one good sign on things to come was the launch of the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant Food Foundation survey in May, which showed that consumers are becoming more concerned about food safety and the effects of climate change on food.In some ways, that should be good news for diners."On food safety, there have been real efforts put in there to make sure the food here is safe and wholesome, and people are eating safe food," said Hamel."Climate change and sustainability — that's an area that's concerned people are paying more attention to because there are some people who don't believe there's a connection between global warming and climate change," he said.A growing consensus is that in a world that's getting warmer, there has to be greater care in what food we eat and how it is grown, Yolken said. And while that may seem a long way off, he says, "it's a growing consensus.""I have a lot of friends who don't eat out a great deal and have good nutrition and a balanced diet," he says. "They're trying to do better."Yolken, in fact	0
James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises," in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering "a psychotic episode" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence "revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012," the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him.	1
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent out a warning to hospitals about a new antibiotic-resistant bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. While this strain of bacteria is not new, it has  emerged with alarming speed and has resulted in cases of septic shock and multiple-organ failure, a new report reveals.Infection with CRE occurs when an organism takes up residence in the colon or abdominal cavity of people with weakened immune systems. When these weakened people take antibiotics, the bacteria can break out of their colon and infiltrate any nearby or underlying tissue. Even when the bacteria is removed from the patient, the body may still be left vulnerable to infection.The infection results in a condition known as septic shock, which is characterized by a rapid drop in blood pressure, and a decline in organ function that requires high doses of fluids and other medications to treat. Mortality can be as high as 50 percent, according to a CDC report (pdf).Affecting people of all ages, CRE infection presents a formidable health risk to those who are in hospitals.“The CDC has identified CRE as the largest infectious disease threat to hospitals of all types in the U.S.,” said an agency report (pdf) on the bacteria. “In fact, CRE is second only to HIV/AIDS as the single largest cause of hospitalizations in the U.S.”In the report, the CDC also identified an additional 4,000 cases of patients who had already developed CRE infection that were undetected.“CRE has become part of the everyday culture of hospitals,” CDC epidemiologist John Nothstein told CBS News. “There’s a lot of stigma around it, but people are still not recognizing what it is and how it can spread.”CRE was first discovered in 1998, and in the meantime, the bacteria has had a strong foothold in the hospital environment. Since then, the CDC has identified more than 2,700 people who have contracted CRE, according to the agency. The bacteria are spread by people and animals who act as vectors.These bacteria were detected in 12 states, with the highest incidence reported in California, New York, Illinois, Texas, and Florida, the report found. They’ve been identified in patients at hospitals across the country, including in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky	0
Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing. An assessment team from the nonprofit ichthyologos came and went, leaving behind about $150,000 in earthquake and tsunami preparedness equipment.The group’s efforts, experts say, are important, but that does not mean they have won a war. ichthyologos has been training Indonesian troops and other first responders for years at a time of great risk, a kind of informal military school. There’s no formal school, and ichthyologos says that most of its training is for tsunami-imminent events like the one in the Indian Ocean. The organization also is providing equipment, such as tents and generators, to those who need them most to evacuate high-risk communities.The biggest hurdle for the organization is the difficulty of getting equipment through the Indonesian and military bureaucracies to troops who need it and aren’t trained to get it.“The Indonesian people are very grateful,” says ichthyologos senior organizer Jodie Roesch, a 35-year-old German expatriate who came to volunteer. “We have the support of the United Nations, and the French. And we are also doing things to reduce the vulnerability of small coastal communities.” ichthyologos offers workshops on earthquake preparedness as well as on tsunami evacuation as a way to get these skills into the hands of soldiers.But not all of the organization’s $150,000 of earthquake and tsunami equipment is getting out and into the hands of troops and first responders. A key piece is a $40,000 tsunami alert system sent by the organization to 1,000 Indonesian volunteers, but only about 50% have received it, says ichthyologos.“We are working with a very difficult bureaucracy, where we are the new kid on the block,” says ichthyologos organizer David Smeenk, a retired U.S. Marine Corps brigadier general who has been in Indonesia since the 2004 tsunami. ichthyologos has three full-time staffers and three volunteers providing technical assistance, but most of the earthquake and tsunami preparedness work is carried out by volunteers, he says.The organization is seeking ways	0
Reputed Boston mob boss and longtime fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger is the defendant in a sensational murder and racketeering trial, but proceedings Friday in federal court had one prosecutor choking up with emotion while defending the work of another law enforcement officer. And that moment came before a jury has even been seated. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak choked up during arguments in the case as he defended one of his main investigators, Massachusetts Lt. Steve Johnson. Wyshak was responding to a defense claim that one of the key witnesses in the case may have been involved in further criminal activity since his release from federal prison in 2007, and that a member of the Massachusetts State Police claimed the investigation into that defense witness' activities was compromised. In court, Bulger attorney Henry Brennan said the state trooper who complained felt "undermined by one of his superiors, Steve Johnson." Brennan says the trooper was "not only undermined....so discontent he made complaints." The defense witness, John Mortorano, has admitted he killed 20 people as part of Bulger's criminal organization that ruled south Boston for decades. He was released as part of a plea deal in exchange for his testimony. Wyshak acknowledged in court that the Massachusetts state police investigated claims from "sources" that Mortorano was again involved in criminal activity after he was freed. Wyshak said the investigation included "numerous interviews" and that the "allegations were unfounded," calling the accusations "a lot of smoke." Wyshak said the information was turned over to the defense in May. What apparently wasn't turned over was an additional internal state police investigation into Johnson's handling of the case. Wyshak, addressing U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper, became emotional as he defended Johnson, calling him, "one of the best law enforcement officers I know." Wyshak said the the internal investigation found complaints against Johnson were "unsubstantiated" and that the "real villain is the state trooper" who he says "went off the deep-end" and denied the allegations when confronted. Wyshak said that trooper faces disciplinary action. The judge did not rule on whether the defense is entitled to documents pertaining to the internal investigation. The conduct of law enforcement is key in the case since prosecutors allege a corrupt FBI agent aided Bulger in his criminal actives while Bulger himself was a government informant.	1

The psychiatrist treating the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could potentially be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported Wednesday, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. The psychiatrist's concerns surfaced in early June, nearly six weeks before the July 20 killings inside a movie theater in Aurora, sources told the Denver station. Twelve people were killed and 58 wounded when the gunman opened fire during a screening of the new Batman film. James Holmes, 24, was charged Monday with murder and attempted murder in the case; he also faces two weapons charges. Why Holmes was charged in 'unusual' way A court document filed Friday revealed Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton before the attack. Sources told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a "behavioral evaluation and threat assessment" team to say Holmes could potentially be a danger to others, the station reported. The "BETA" team consists of "key" staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus, the school says on its website. Holmes was a doctoral student at the university's Anschutz Medical Campus until June, when he withdrew from the program. Sources told KMGH that university officials never contacted Aurora police with Fenton's concerns before the July 20 killings. Aurora heroes: Three who gave their lives "Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team" in "the first 10 days" of June but it "never came together" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Sources told the station that when Holmes withdrew, the BETA team "had no control over him." KMGH said sources did not know what Holmes told Fenton that sparked her concern. "It takes more than just statements," one source told the station, explaining that Holmes would have had to tell Fenton "something specific" before she would have to report it to law enforcement. "He would have to tell her he had taken steps to make it happen," another source told the station. One source also told the station that the team may not have been convened because while Fenton had "serious concerns, there may not have been an immediate threat."	1

As Democrats continue to splinter over President Obama's proposed health care reform plan, Republicans are taking the opportunity to home in on a key argument: A good bill deserves more time and deliberation. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, says his party may have enough votes to stall Democratic health care reform. Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, said Friday that Obama's rush to put a bill together is "totally irresponsible." "Most of us believe that the decision as to major reform of how Americans get their health care in this country deserves at least as much time and deliberation as it would take to select a puppy to live in the White House," he said. "It took the president six months to decide how long and which puppy he was going to have. ... To expect Congress to do something on major health care reform in six days is totally irresponsible." Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, speaking on conservative Hugh Hewitt's radio show recently, was asked about whether his party had enough votes to block health care from going forward. His answer: "I think so. I really do." "If he is unsuccessful, which I anticipate and will predict he is, on getting a vote prior to the August recess, then I would say there's no way in the world they're going to get this done this year," he added. Obama's fight to get health care reform through Congress hit a major snag this week -- facing opposition from Republicans and fiscally conservative "Blue Dog" Democrats worried over the costs -- estimated to be around $1 trillion. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced that the Senate would not take up a vote before August recess -- a deadline that Obama had originally wanted.  Watch a GOP senator lash out at Obama's plan » Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas responded to Democratic criticism that the GOP has failed to present a viable plan. "When the Democrats say we don't have a plan ... where's their plan? If they can't get a bill out of committee, where's their plan?" he said. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said it's hard to combat the Democrats' proposed legislation when it changes "by 100 pages every time you walk into the room." The GOP's fight is also getting political, namely looking ahead to the upcoming midterm election.	1
Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said. Flight delays at de Gaulle were iced over, and many passengers were stuck at terminals in Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Madrid and other cities.“That has to lead to more cancellations at the airport,” said Thierry Tresca, the president of the National Air Traffic Services Association, the union that represents pilots at Air France and other airlines.Air France canceled 10 flights to and from Paris, including a pair of international flights that were supposed to land at 2:35 a.m. Paris time, the Paris prosecutor’s office said.In total, about 2,200 flights cancelled or delayed at de Gaulle since Wednesday were delayed because of the icy weather, the Paris prosecutor’s office said.At the height of the winter’s snowstorm, airlines were forced to cancel more than 300 flights at De Gaulle alone, the French aviation authority said.The disruption at the airport came as the Paris region prepares to host the 20th World Youth Days, a youth festival in January where hundreds of thousands of participants from across the world gather to share a common culture and experience international travel.The airport was also closed for two days of the winter solstice, a traditional end of the year celebration in Europe. Passengers were stranded at terminals until after 1 a.m. local time on Sunday.“It’s bad for tourism in Paris and the whole region,” said Eric Largier, who works at the French aviation authority.“The World Youth Days will have to postpone or cancel many sessions. It’s going to be a loss of tourism for the whole region,” he said.Another French official acknowledged a sense of frustration in airports across the country, where the government has made it a priority to repair and build terminals to handle the expected surge of winter travelers.At French airports, the winter has become a two-front contest. On one hand, there’s a need to ensure the facilities are able to handle the expected increase in passenger traffic in the coming weeks, and a growing season that is starting earlier and warmer, meaning more people will fly.	0
Taliban fighters from Pakistan say they have united with al Qaeda forces in Syria to fight the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The commander of the Pakistan Taliban, Abdul Rashid Abbasi, has said the merger was between the two sides' leadership. But there was some uncertainty over whether the merger was really happening because of some reports that the leader of the Pakistan Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was still alive.A report last month from the Pakistani newspaper The News described the merger as being under way. The report said Mullah Omar, who had been killed in a drone attack in 2010, had been replaced by al Qaeda's chief emir in Pakistan. The article quoted Abdul Rashid Abbasi, a member of the Pakistan Taliban, as saying Mullah Omar was alive and well but that he was not on the official payroll of the Pakistan Taliban and had not directed the recent merger. The New York Times has also reported on the merger. The article reports that the Pakistan Taliban's leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has died after suffering injuries in a drone strike. There is also speculation that Mullah Omar may have staged an escape from Pakistan to evade the death in a drone strike.The New York Times report says Mullah Omar had planned a military coup against the Pakistani government last year. He was killed on September 28, 2010 by a U.S-made strike in the northwest of Pakistan.Abbasi himself has made very little public comment on the subject of the merger.  His most recent statement was a fatwa (religious ruling) in August that supported Pakistan's military action against militant positions in North Waziristan.Escape from Pakistan and deathThe Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on August 10, 2010 that Mullah Omar, the head of Pakistan's Taliban movement, had survived a drone attack in North Waziristan last year, and had fled to safety in the country's tribal areas in a bid to avoid being targeted. He is believed to have sought refuge in the Datta Khel Valley, a remote region in North Waziristan.The report says Mullah Omar stayed in Pakistan's Datta Khel Valley for three months to rest and regroup before returning to Afghanistan to fight against President Hamid Karzai's forces in Afghanistan.According to the report, Mullah Omar was on  the ground at his Khyber tribal	0
Hundreds of demonstrators extended their sit-in outside Egypt's defense ministry to a sixth day Thursday, as organizers called for mass protests following violence that killed at least 11 people. The coalition of political and civil groups -- known as the Board of Trustees of the Revolution -- condemned the clashes in Cairo's Abaseya area Wednesday and demanded the resignation of the government. The protests come against a backdrop of frustration over the pace of reform since Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president last year and amid concern that Egypt's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. Many of the protesters taking part in the sit-in are voicing their anger over the disqualification of Islamist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael from the May 23 presidential election. They also want to disband the presidential election commission. Abu Ismael was disqualified because of evidence that his late mother had U.S. citizenship, an assertion he has denied, prompting his followers to protest the decision by the election commission. The election commission has disqualified some 10 of the 23 presidential contenders, its chief has said. Meanwhile, three of Egypt's presidential candidates were referred to the general prosecutor for alleged violations of election campaign law Thursday. The presidential election commission said it had referred leading independent candidate Abdel Monein Aboul Fettouh, Mohamed Mursi, of the Islamist Freedom and Justice Party, and Amr Moussa to the prosecutor for breaking the law by holding meetings on college campuses. "These infringements by the presidential candidates will be taken very seriously and they will be questioned as soon as possible. They could be fined," Adel Saeed, the official spokesman for the general prosecutor, told CNN. Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on its Facebook page Thursday that the clashes in Abaseya were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly. The Supreme Council also said certain "unnamed" groups have used verses from the Quran calling for jihad, or holy war, to try to draw the military into an armed conflict. The military had tried to convince the protesters to move from their position near the Ministry of Defense to Tahrir Square, the heart of Egypt's protest movement, but they refused, the Facebook statement said. "Investigations into the clashes of Abseya Square have begun and some people have been arrested," Saeed said.	1
Q: Why are doctors recommending fewer cancer screenings? Shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it? "His teeth began to chatter. God All-Mighty! He thought, why haven't I realized it all these years. I've gone around with a -- skeleton -- inside me! I won't stand for it." In one of Ray Bradbury's most famous short stories, "The Skeleton," the lead character goes insane after becoming obsessed with the fact that he has something foreign and frightening inside himself. The story, preposterous as it is, rings psychologically true because it taps into the most primal of all human terrors: Having one's body invaded by something different than oneself, especially when that thing is not just different, but dangerous. This evolved fear, which is supported by very specific mechanisms in the brain and nervous system, likely helps explain why people are so much more terrified of cancer than they are of heart disease, even though the average American is more likely to die of the latter than the former. In the case of heart disease, there is only the failure of something we've always had ticking away inside us. On the other hand, cancers are our own cells that quickly become hideous mutant beings, not quite us, but not quite something else either. Whatever they are, they invade our bodies to disfigure and destroy us. Much has been written recently about why people are so upset over the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation to abandon the current practice of routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer. Some experts have argued that the negative reaction comes from the fact that the panel is just flat-out wrong. The problem with this argument is that copious data suggest that the panel is right. A recent blog on Time.com more insightfully suggested that people are loathe to abandon even worthless blood tests because they anecdotally know someone who claims he/she was saved by getting this test at the right moment. Prostate cancer screening's false promise As a psychiatrist I can't help but wonder if the extra fever pitch of outrage over abandoning prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, tests might also have its roots in our primal fear of harboring dangerous strangers beneath our skin and our consequent reluctance to give up any light in the darkness that might flush such foreign combatants from the shores of our bodies.	1
Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa. Residents in Sanaa are stranded in their homes, and some even fear looking out of their windows as they are left after being forced out during the demonstrations.By: Rania AbouzeidMarch 26, 2014Residents of the Yemeni capital Sanaa have taken to the streets as demonstrators are protesting against the recent decision to remove the Yemeni President from office.While the protesters chant slogans in favour of the president, government forces are using force to move civilians from their homes. The government’s heavy-handed tactics have sparked widespread outrage among residents.The demonstrations have been spreading rapidly since Wednesday, following a decision by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who has ruled Yemen since 1978, to step down from power.The decision was announced as the protesters began gathering on the streets of the capital, calling for the removal of President Hadi.Although demonstrators called for the president to step down, many also said that he should be tried for his role in the war that erupted in the country in 2011.The government has accused the protests of being orchestrated by foreign powers, as Washington and other western countries have expressed their concerns over the Yemen war.“We will be celebrating the return of the president to his duties and ensuring that Yemen is back on the right track,” Hadi said at the end of his speech.After the demonstrations, which lasted for three days, protesters have taken to the streets again and are calling for a second round of protests on Friday. Yemen’s opposition group known as the Joint List released a statement on that evening saying that they would not join the protest on Friday. The group said that they did not want to leave public property or damage government property.Protesters have reportedly set fire to the governor’s mansion and the headquarters of the Republican Guard.While many have been forced out of their homes by security forces and are taking refuge in empty buildings, others have also begun to take shelter in mosques, the BBC reports.Some of those in hiding in homes said they feared being discovered by local residents, since many suspected them to be protesters, the BBC reports.“There are some people in hiding who fear being discovered and	0
Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today's Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters. The Internet was designed to have no central point of  failure—its major components were so widely dispersed that if one failed, the whole network would still work. But, as the world has continued to grow, the Internet has grown more complex, and the number of possible failure scenarios has steadily increased.In March 2015, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh set out to address one of these catastrophic failure scenarios. The goal was to build a network architecture that could be easily built in a test lab and then rapidly deployed to sites around the world. The researchers decided to test their network of self-healing nodes on the Intranet, in this case, the University of Pittsburgh's IT services were being tested because they were widely available and easy to maintain. They took advantage of recent advances in microprocessor and networking technology to create a "virtualized" network in which every node was a software-defined network function. As the number of nodes in the network increased, the number of possible failure scenarios also increased.To find the optimal network architecture, the researchers began with a simple network of one central controller and one or more local controllers. The controller ran an embedded operating system that contained an embedded communications protocol that communicated with each of the controllers. Each controller acted as an individual node in the network based on its physical location. In simple terms, the central controller would provide physical connectivity to each local controller in the network. The network structure would be established based on the availability and location of the local controllers.The central controller would continuously monitor the system's health indicator to stay on top of the health of the network. To keep the network alive across failures, the central controller used the virtual networking protocol to transmit commands to each controller, and each controller used its embedded communications protocol to transmit updates to its individual physical location in the network.The researchers also created a protocol to allow the central controller to manage the network. This provided the central controller with an overview of the network health.The researchers determined that the ideal network structure would have two levels: an organization level and an user level. The organization level would consist of a data center that contained a central controller and a central directory service responsible for managing the network structure. The central directory service would not only allow the central controller and the local	0
Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen's interior minister and a rebel official said. That news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came Â weeks after the start of the war sparked by the refusal of the central government to recognize Yemen's president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.In a show of force in response to the announcement of the agreement, a Saudi jet escorted by a fleet of fighter jets patrolled over the rebel-held presidential palace. Saudi Arabia and allied Sunni Arab states have been bombing schools, hospitals and civilian targets in Yemen in a bid to halt the advance of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).But the conflict appears to be moving past the presidential palace, which has been targeted by rebel missiles and is being bombarded with jets from both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.By 5 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) the fighting had largely stopped in the capital, said Yemen's Interior Minister Mansur Al-Qadah.His agency said in a statement posted to Twitter that "a large number of the armed groups withdrew from the presidential complex, as well as from the al-Sanan (Harwood) area."The statement said "the remaining groups left after they agreed to cease fire."Saudi Arabia accuses the rebels of carrying out attacks inside the kingdom.The announcement of an agreement to end the fighting was one of the first indications that the war could be nearing a halt. If so, it would be a significant victory for the government in its fight to defeat the rebels who have been holed up in the two cities for more than a year.The war began when Hadi defied a Â demand from the United States and Britain that he cede control of Yemen's government to the south of the country and allow the country to be united under their rule. The war escalated when Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states intervened, sending bombs and fighter jets into the capital to fight the rebels.This week, the rebels have been making gains. On Friday, they said they had captured the presidential palace and were also making advances on the presidential compound.The Hadi-controlled government, meanwhile, has complained that rebel actions have damaged Yemen's commercial sector.Yemen is divided between the north and the south.

China will execute within a few hours a British man convicted of smuggling heroin, his family said Monday. Akmal Shaikh, 53, has been informed by the Chinese authorities that he will be executed, said Seema Khan and Latif Shaikh, first and second sons of the man from west London.The decision to execute the man is a result of a high-level political deal between China and Britain in which both sides agreed on the use of the death sentence reserved for drug smugglers.The British government had lobbied the Chinese government for months to conclude an agreement to spare Shaikh's life, in part out of concern over what British government sources described as the growing scale of drug smuggling from East Asia to Europe. British officials had pushed for the Chinese to make the execution contingent on Britain's approval.A decision to proceed with Shaikh's execution was reached just hours after Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Britain, where he met British Prime Minister John Major."Britain and China have had serious talks about the smuggling of heroin and narcotics. Last night's talks were very fruitful and a mutually-beneficial agreement reached concerning the use of the death penalty in China-Britain co-operation," Major said on the White House news telephone. Major said the agreement was reached after "quite a lot of serious discussion."Major's comments were made after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Yaohong said Monday that his government and Britain had agreed upon a number of principles, including the death penalty for drug smugglers and heroin and drug-related offenses.But he refused to comment on the specific details reached during the meeting. Major also said the "new principles" had been agreed upon after a "long and productive discussion."Shaikh was convicted in July 1997 on drugs and other charges at the High Court of Justice in London. At the time he ran a thriving illicit drug network in Britain, where he sold heroin and amphetamines for up to £10 a ounce (US$15).Under the terms of Sunday's agreement, London will provide the Chinese government with a list of more than 1,000 drug smugglers,	0
The shoe attack on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Egypt, the latest on a politician in the Middle East, causes many in West to ask: Why is throwing a shoe such a big deal? One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008. Journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi tossed it because he wanted to "humiliate the tyrant," his brother told CNN. "Yes, I was there," Tawfeeq said. "It was a very big deal in Iraq." Read more: Iraqi artist inspired by George W Bush shoe thrower In fact, some Iraqis celebrated that moment, he said. "Other people were not happy because for them they see it -- by end of the day -- like a guest visiting their country," Tawfeeq said.  "Traditionally, it was also offensive to insult a guest." The act of throwing a shoe at someone or showing them your sole is "incredibly offensive" in the Middle East, he said. "The bottom line is a shoe is dirt," he said. "Throwing a shoe on someone means throwing dirt on that person." Professor Faegheh Shirazi, with Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, agreed, saying it is offensive "regardless of the religious practices." "Throwing a shoe or hitting someone with a shoe or showing the bottom of your shoe when sitting with legs up on a chair and facing another person all are culturally unacceptable and are considered to be a grave insult and belittling to a person," Shirazi said. Another offensive aspect is the significance of the shoe being a sign of wealth. "Most often, lower-status people and poor men could not wear shoes," Shirazi said. "The feet came in contact with pollution and the dirt on the road. The dirt on the feet indicated the lack of social status, the level of economic class and the level of education and lack of sophistication and intellect." Tawfeeq, who occasionally visits the United States, was surprised to learn shoe throwing was not considered an offense in North America. A search of literature reveals references suggesting the power of the shoe is ancient.	1
What would we lose if we lost 220,000 postal jobs (120,000 proposed through layoffs, 100,000 through attrition), 3,700 post offices, 300 mail processing plants, or even the post office itself? With millions of jobs and businesses lost to the recent recession, these may seem like just more numbers, or more seemingly inevitable "facts" -- that in the electronic age we now rely on the private sector to deliver public services. But postal workers are people we depend on and post offices are places we want to know will always be there. Downsizing the U.S Postal Service - -which is so low on money, it's in imminent danger of default -- may seem like a ripple in this troubled economy, but it promises to be a social tsunami if action isn't taken soon to save it. For one thing, the postal service has been a huge employer. Before I became a history professor I carried mail for the Postal Service for 20 years. As with many government jobs, you're hired for this one based on achieving a high score on a competitive exam. Veterans, roughly 20% of today's postal workforce (though once well over 50%) earn extra points on this exam, thus giving them a head start and a job to come home to after military service. Who were my co-workers? Just everyday people who, like me in 1980, were attracted to a job that had good benefits, job security, and started at $8.10 an hour. This was as a result of the 1970 nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in New York after postal workers declared they were tired of earning $2.95 an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet. In collecting oral histories for a book I later wrote on the postal service, I interviewed those who had worked before 1970, including those who struck. The postal worker's job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers, delivering it as letter carriers, driving it as truck drivers, and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles, buildings, and grounds. Above all, postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public.	1
The mayor of Newark has called for an investigation into a far-reaching New York Police Department surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the New Jersey city's Muslim's neighborhoods. "The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with  the NYPD," said Michael T. O'Brien on Friday. "Newark Police Department personnel have a longstanding policy of not working with the New York City Police Department. So, this investigation is about to turn to the New York Police Department."The mayor told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that his comments were "based upon what I have seen with my own eyes and my gut" after he personally went to the police department to investigate a story in the Times of New York last Friday. "I believe what they have done is outrageous," he said. At that point the story was confirmed to O'Brien. "You can read it for yourself here," he said. "I saw it with my own eyes." O'Brien, who was the first mayor to call for an investigation into New York's controversial surveillance program, told CNN that he also saw a video showing the police officers allegedly surveilling members of the Muslim community.Police chief Ray Kelly, in a press conference shortly after the story broke, said he was not aware of the video. But when he spoke to the mayor "I was able to ask him directly, "Was there a surveillance unit in Newark?" He said the mayor told him that no "specific unit" was involved. O'Brien says he has been briefed in advance on some of the surveillance programs, but he says he was not "aware of the totality of what the program was nor the details of how it was conducted.""The mayor's story is not supported by what I saw with my own eyes." O'Brien told CNN, "And I have not heard back from the mayor. I don't expect to, either."The mayor's office did not return CNN's call for comments on Friday. O'Brien says he has been trying to get the details of the investigation into the police department, from the mayor and the U.S. Attorney's office -- and that "it should have happened long ago."He says, "I've been on the internet, trying to find a copy of the internal affairs report the police department submitted to the U.S. attorney's office and what the city has said about what they found." But until he has received details	0
Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie is visiting Iraq to boost what she sees as lagging efforts to deal with the problems of 2 million "very very vulnerable" internally displaced people in the wartorn country. Angelina Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq. "There doesn't seem to be a real coherent plan to help them," said Jolie, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN's Arwa Damon Thursday. "There's lots of goodwill. Lots of discussion, but there seems to be a lot of talk at the moment, and a lot of pieces that need to be put together. I'm trying to figure out what they are." A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn Iraq.  Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Jolie » Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the Middle East since the 1948 creation of Israel. More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes, around 2 million to neighboring states, mostly Syria and Jordan, and another 2.2 million displaced inside Iraq. The flight was aggravated by the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare. Many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor, crowded into camps and slums that often lack basic necessities, such as proper food, health care and shelter. "How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East," said Jolie. "It's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can lead to a lot of instability and aggression."    Read transcript of interview Jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the U.N.H.C.R. In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem. She heard stories from refugees about their plight.  Watch as Jolie lunches with troops » This visit to Iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced, 58 percent of whom are under age 12.

James Franco won't be following Dennis Rodman into North Korea anytime soon. Franco's latest movie -- a comedy about two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- has earned the distinction of a frothing rant from the regime in Pyongyang. "The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership," a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman told the country's state-run news agency Wednesday. The film, titled "The Interview," stars Franco and Seth Rogen as two lightweight talk show hosts recruited by the CIA to take out Kim. It's not due in theaters until October, but the trailer is already drawing worldwide attention, including in the corridors of power in Pyongyang. 'Team America' The distribution of the movie is "the most undisguised terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their mental mainstay and bring down its social system," the North Korean spokesman raged, using an abbreviation of the authoritarian country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Comedians taking shots at North Korea's dictatorial leadership is hardly new -- it goes back at least a generation. A decade ago, "Team America: World Police" used puppets to lampoon Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state. Kim Jong Il also popped up as a waiter in NBC's "Thirty Rock" -- albeit one who claimed to be "the greatest waiter of all time." Brutal regime The situation in North Korea is no joke. A recent United Nations commission detailed a horrifying list of crimes it says the regime has committed against its own people, including the large-scale use of prison camps and torture. The cold-blooded brutality of the system was displayed late last year when Kim Jong Un's uncle was purged and executed. Meanwhile, the isolated state continues to develop its nuclear weapons program, which it has used to threaten neighboring countries and the United States. Will Kim watch? But like his father, Kim Jong Un has also brought about bizarre moments in his two and a half years in power, such as his basketball-based friendship with Rodman. Such peculiar behavior, along with the secrecy in which the regime cloaks itself, is hard for comedians to resist.	1
Former Vice President Dick Cheney led a parade of George W. Bush administration officials who denounced a report on harsh interrogation techniques used against terrorism suspects, saying he would "do it again in a minute."  The Washington Post and The New York Times editorialized against the Bush administration, while The New Yorker said the CIA conducted illegal, unethical and unprofessional "waterboarding" practices that violated international standards.Cheney's statement has drawn criticism from civil libertarians who say it shows him approving of torture and violates the Geneva convention. The U.S. military's public affairs officer, Colonel James G. Iyall, defended Cheney's statement, saying, "the practice of waterboarding and stress positions was a legitimate military interrogation program under the auspices of the Justice Department and the CIA. It had zero to do with the Army and Navy and was conducted in compliance with the rules and laws of the Geneva Conventions. It was used in Iraq."On December 9, 2003, President Bush publicly announced that he would authorize an additional $1 billion in spending on the program, the first major military action in the war to come out of a domestic debate about the war.On July 23, 2004, a U.S. military panel reported that of the 572 detainees who underwent waterboarding, 48% were later released or transferred to a facility where they could receive appropriate treatment. The report also recommended that CIA interrogators were not "treating detainees humanely" and that the CIA was not properly monitoring its interrogations. The report concluded that the CIA's failure to provide detainees with food and water, and to properly supervise and control the interrogations, led to "torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and other ill-treatment". The CIA acknowledged the torture and concluded that the report mischaracterized the interrogations that followed. It was publicly criticized by the CIA's chief of station in Pakistan, and retired Rear Admiral William J. Lynn, who was the former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He said of the report, "The CIA's interrogation efforts in the field and in the Agency's own analysis at the time were a farce. The CIA's own methods of detaining and interrogating terrorists were inadequate. The CIA's efforts to gain information from detainees by means of torture were also a sham."In response to the CIA's revelations, Bush said, "Some would choose to frame it as somehow being out of character with	0
The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint. An adventurous boy and a cranky man travel by unusual means in the new Pixar film "Up." Pixar, which  has made the Oscar-winning short "Up," which won a 2013 Golden Globe, the Hugo and the BAFTA film prizes, has been busy this past year. It has its own animated film, "The Good Dinosaur," set for a 2014 release date; its Pixar shorts "Cars," "Monsters University" and the "Brave" film adaptation are making big waves, and a new Pixar film is in the works."Up" stars the voice of Anne Hathaway as a princess named Merida (she had her first voice role in "Toy Story 2" and has since voiced many other characters including a version of Winnie-the-Pooh) and George Clooney as an inventor who finds himself stranded on the Isle of Pines. The film has also been praised for its animated story, its use of music, especially the song from the Disney classic "The Little Mermaid," and its unique story.But this is not a movie for the casual crowd. It's a sophisticated drama, and it is an adult film. In many ways it is a children's film, and at many parts of the film its dialogue is for young children. It is a film about growing up, and growing up in a world where things are supposed to be a certain way, and you are not supposed to question that. This is not a film for the movie-going public, or the audience that was expecting the animation to be an easy thing to laugh at."Up" opens today with a screening of the film at the Cannes Film Festival's Palais des Festivals, which has in the past hosted the Cannes Film Festival. It has not been a festival of many films, and the Palais des Festivals will only take the film that's shown there. It will be a tough opening, as the main film has been met with some degree of disappointment by many. It's like opening a film that you know will be bad, expecting a warm welcome.The Cannes Film Festival is considered a major film festival. Usually, it is a festival that brings in the cream of the crop of film makers. "Up" will be opening at a time when Cannes Film Festival has had a lot of films from the animation industry	0
The stars were out Sunday night as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts bestowed its prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on actor and comedian  Bill Murray.The two-time Academy Award nominee, who is an internationally recognized funnyman and voice actor, was nominated for his recurring role as Maxie in the HBO drama series “Treme.”The actor has hosted the Academy Awards on three occasions, and has won two Emmys from the Broadcast Television Journalists Association in 2013 and 2016. In November 2017, he played Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he played the host, and in January 2018, he hosted the Golden Globes alongside Sandra Oh and Tina Fey. Murray reprised his role as Jimmy in the 2018 film, “The Morning Show” and in 2019, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!“The Mark Twain Prize and the Kennedy Center’s mission of inspiring creativity is one we take very seriously,” said Peter Berg, president and CEO of the Kennedy Center. “This year’s honoree Bill Murray is a comedic treasure, and we look forward to continuing this great relationship with him and ‘Treme.’”Created by two of the world’s most-lauded writers, “The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor” honors comedic writers who have made contributions to American culture. This year’s award was named after the late writer Mark Twain, who is famous for some of his most famous sayings, from “The man who deceives himself is likely to live a long time.” The award winner receives $50,000 and a plaque with the name “Mark Twain” engraved on it.In 2013, Bill Murray’s star began to rise when “Treme” ran for two seasons on HBO, where he portrayed the lead character, Maxie, a local music legend who takes a backseat to the New Orleans mayor who hires him on the radio station. The show premiered in May 2017, and has been renewed for a third season.When asked about the nomination, Murray responded: “I am extremely humbled to receive this award. This is a very special, special award, but this is a prize that I have been trying to get for two-and-a-half years now. I have never ever gotten a Mark Twain	0
Fear over Ebola is growing as international leaders and health organizations struggle to try to stop the deadly epidemic in West Africa. The Ebola outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it," Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement Friday. "This is an unprecedented outbreak accompanied by unprecedented challenges. And these challenges are extraordinary." This is the first Ebola outbreak in West Africa and involves the most deadly strain in the Ebola virus family, Chan said. "If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries." One of those countries could be the United States, health officials have said. In fact, the U.S. Department of State announced Friday that it is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to bring home two U.S. citizens who have been infected by Ebola in Liberia. Here's what you need to know about the Ebola outbreak today: How many people have died? As of Sunday, the World Health Organization had confirmed 909 cases and 485 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. It suspects that there may have been up to 1,323 cases and 729 deaths. "The outbreak is by far the largest ever in the nearly four-decade history of this disease," Chan said. "It is the largest in terms of numbers of cases and deaths. ... It is the largest in terms of geographical areas already affected and others at immediate risk of further spread." CDC Director Tom Frieden said Thursday that it could take three to six months to stop the epidemic. Why is it spreading so quickly? First of all, there's no vaccine for Ebola. So health officials have to stop the infection by isolating patients to prevent further transmission. Past outbreaks have primarily occurred in rural areas, where people were not frequently traveling and infecting others. This outbreak has made it to several of the region's major cities, including Freetown, Sierra Leone; Monrovia, Liberia; and Conakry, Guinea. These cities have international airports, which opens up the possibility of infected patients traveling abroad. For example, American Patrick Sawyer became infected with Ebola in Liberia and traveled via plane to Lagos, Nigeria, where he died. Health officials are still tracing all the people he came in contact with along the way.	1
China will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, bow out. In the post-Mao era, Chinese leadership change and power transition have become institutionalized and more predictable. That's until the somewhat unexpected Bo Xilai affair. Although the sacking of the Chongqing leader -- in the wake of a murder investigation that implicated him and his wife -- revealed the startling degree of widespread corruption and abuse of power among high-ranking leaders, it also exposed the intense struggle among various ideologies of China's leaders and intellectual elites. This is somewhat unprecedented.  After three decades of reforms, China's social economic landscape has been transformed. Short-term and long-term problems and challenges abound. While addressing such problems as inflation, the asset bubble, corruption and increasingly daring expressions of public discontent, China's leaders and intellectual elites are also searching for long-term legitimacy. The challenge has become more pressing, as Chinese society gets wealthier and more restless after three decades of rapid economic and social change. China is in urgent need of a soul, a set of dominant ideas, as the efficacy of the Chinese Communist Party's official ideology -- emphasizing "harmonious society" and "scientific development" -- diminishes. Despite the Party's calls to "speak with one voice," dissenting ideas and differences are being voiced and heard. Unlike the simple dichotomy of reformers and conservatives during the 1980s and early 1990s, today's sets of views on China's problems and its future have become more sophisticated and complex. The increasingly intense debate now appears to have three strands: the neoliberal reformers who seek to liberalize the economic and political arenas and reverse the recent expansion of the state; the neo-Maoists who argue for strengthening the state and breaking what they see as a "state capitalist" alliance between the rich and the powerful; and the neo-Confucian traditionalists who bemoan the loss of a moral compass in a modernizing society and want to rekindle China's soft power in the world. Dominating the debates and ideological clashes are the neoliberals and the neo-Maoists who occupy the leadership, while neo-Confucians, popular as they may be among some common folk and patriotic youths, have yet to find their strong advocates among top leaders. Why you can't expect easy answers with new leadership	1
Maria Sharapova's wait for another WTA Tour title must continue after the four-time grand slam champion suffered a shock defeat in the semifinals of the Paris Open on Saturday. Top seed Sharapova would have iced the match and a spot in the U.S. Open a week ago had she won three-setter against second seed Dominika Cibulkova. But the 17-time major champion could not convert a break in the fourth set and was eliminated after a 6-4, 7-6 (6) defeat.Sharapova, who became the first Russian to win a Grand Slam title in 1996, is the world's top-ranked women's tennis player and had been inching closer to a third major title having reached the final at the French Open in July.Now, she is going to try to do it a fourth time in Paris, where the event is held for the 13th straight year.The Russian, No. 1 in the world entering this week, defeated the Czech Republic's Lucie Safareva, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, in the semifinals.She could not recover from a tough start in the match after falling at love with a forehand volley at the start of the first set.After recovering from that scare, she made it 2-0 at 5-4 in the second set when the Czech star retired because of illness."I knew how important this match was for me so I tried to play my game and tried not to get bored and to always be on the ball as much as possible," Sharapova said."I never had the chance to use my best tennis and get an inside in the second game to break her."Sharapova said she could not play defense and the pressure of the match and the stage proved too much for her."I didn't play my best tennis. I was a little tired. I was too pressured. I played really better in the first set but I was so uncharacteristically nervous," she said."I couldn't get the ball to go in. I was so unlucky and I lost the ball from a backhand (in the eighth game of the second set)."I was so uncharacteristically nervous and I have to be very careful in the semifinal. I was on the verge of winning the match until that	0
After more than seven hours of deliberations, jurors still haven't decided whether Jodi Arias will live or die. The Arizona jury sent out a note Wednesday morning saying its members couldn't agree. Judge Sherry Stephens told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room. It was another unexpected turn in the dramatic, high-profile murder trial, which has lasted for months, sparked a media frenzy and drawn spectators who line up for courtroom seats. Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was "exceptionally cruel" in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder two weeks ago after 15 hours of deliberations. Now, the jury is weighing whether Arias, 32, should get the death penalty. After jurors told Stephens they were stuck on Wednesday, the judge encouraged them to listen to each other, pinpoint areas of agreement and disagreement and ask for further guidance if they need it. It's an approach often described as a "dynamite charge," used by judges to blast open logjams in deliberations and help jurors reach a verdict. It's unclear whether her advice worked. After Stephens ordered them to continue their discussions, jurors deliberated for more than four more hours, then went home for the day. The jury's decision must be unanimous for Arias to be sentenced to death. In the case of a deadlock, a new jury would be chosen for this phase of the trial. A plea for mercy A path of heartbreak, violence, lies and confessions has led Arias to the Phoenix courtroom where her life is now in a jury's hands. On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her. It was a stark reversal from two weeks ago, when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison. "I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it," she told KSAZ shortly after her conviction. But her family implored her to change her mind, she told KSAZ late Tuesday. Now she wants to spare them further heartbreak, she said. "One of my cousins really drove it home for me and told me how much it would affect them, if I did anything to myself," she said.	1
Han Junqian doesn't go outside very often. From 9:30 a.m. until 11 p.m., six days a week, the 50-year-old massage therapist works out of a dingy parlor in Beijing's Xicheng District. There's no commute as Han lives on site. On his iphone, he keeps track of his running stats and workouts.Han's main hobby is cooking. It started with his father and uncle, but now he has a whole collection of food gadgets and gadgets for eating. In fact, he has a couple of chefs working for him. He has a television, stereo, a washing machine, even a bike with two speeds. The only piece of furniture he does not have is a bed. Han Junqian, as he calls himself, is what's known in China as a "massage-tech celebrity." He's known for his strong body but also for his healthy eating habits."I have been working as a massage-tech celebrity for 10 years," Han says. "In the past two years, my popularity has gone up, so I have been able to spend more time on food and health."Han is one of the many thousands of Chinese consumers who have learned to adapt to the rapidly changing tastes of their country. As it shifts from an economy rooted in rural production to one in service industries, China's population is aging, and old baby boomers are leaving the workforce. The country has also been transformed by economic reforms. China's aging population has allowed for this rapid transformation."I had never thought about my future as a 'hobby' career," Han says. "The new generation of technology has changed people's lives. They use the gadgets instead of doing chores. I like to do things for my own joy, instead of for work."What makes Han so interesting, other than his dedication to health and his cooking, is that he's one of China's most successful entrepreneurs, selling a variety of health products. He started his first marketing company when he was 15 years old. The company has four subsidiaries, including the China Beauty Industry Federation, a group that promotes beauty products for women. And when Han was 25, he developed a new kind of face mask made from natural ingredients like pumpkin, soy, rose and jasmine.But none of his products will be sold in the United States.

Hurricane Bill spun northward toward the New England coast Saturday with wind and rain as officials warned beach lovers to head indoors for the night. Signs at Lighthouse Beach at Chatham, Massachusetts, warn beach-goers Saturday ÂÂ“do not swim.â€?The stateâ€™s largest coastal resort region, about 400 miles of beaches, was under a tropical storm warning until sundown, when officials lifted it to the first advisory level for a tropical storm.Officials also warned residents in coastal towns near the eye of the storm to evacuate.The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea and into Cuba, causing damage to both countries.In Mexicoâ€™s Yucatan Peninsula, the storm toppled three trees and cut a power line, according to the N.Y. Times.â€śThis is the second tropical storm to strike the Yucatan Peninsula in as many years,â€? reported the Los Angeles Times.â€śMany parts of coastal Yucatan remained under an orange warning while the storm raged in the northern zone, just across the border in Guatemala.â€?The storm also caused flooding in the eastern U.S., with power outages reported in Texas.A tropical storm warning was issued for the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Texas, for one week.In the Virgin Islands, the Virgin Islands National Park issued a special statement: â€śDue to the high surf, lifeguarding is not available at the beaches,â€? it said. â€śPlease remember to move all your beach equipment to the upper beach by noon today, and be sure to check conditions before heading out.â€?With its maximum sustained winds gusting to 75 miles per hour and a minimum central pressure of 934 mb, Hurricane Bill was expected to make landfall Wednesday night, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it expected the storm to be near Bermuda, or in the North Atlantic, by the end of the week.Hurricane Bill has knocked out power to about 13 million and caused the deaths of two people, according to the Miami Herald.The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement encouraging U.S. citizens to evacuate to higher ground, avoid storm surges or make other preparations to help evacuate their homes.In	0
Singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening, a spokesman said. The accident happened in Santa Ynez, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ÂThe victim, a man in his 40s, was treated at the scene by paramedics, according to a statement from Los Angeles County.Crosby, 71, a California native, had just arrived home with his wife, singer Ann Wilson, after an appearance at the California Music Hall of Fame in Thousand Oaks."It was something I was thinking about, you know, that I would go down to the beach in Santa Barbara, which is a few miles south, and think about the ocean," he said in a statement. "I will always have tremendous respect for the ocean, and the beach is such a wonderful place for me, so when I get the idea I got to go down there to talk to my son and his wife."Crosby was driving north from Santa Barbara when his car left the road and struck a tree on a public street, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Nobody in the vehicle was injured, officials said.Crosby has said he'd been considering his legacy in the face of mounting criticism over how much his public image has changed over the years.Last year, he was hit with a record fine of $300,000 for two performances that featured a lesbian. During those shows, Crosby wore a rainbow-striped suit to promote the annual AIDS March that takes place each June in Los Angeles. He also wore a dress at the gay and lesbian pride parade in Washington D.C.Just days before the concert in Santa Barbara, Crosby was caught on camera smoking crack cocaine outside his house.	0
I'd already run about half the marathon when the next refreshment table came into view. Thirsty and needing to stay charged for the next 13 miles, I elbowed my way through the crowds of runners and grabbed my drink of iced water from the little counter by the door.I didn't have a cell phone when I started running, but I did in November 2007. At the time it was called iPhone, but by the end of the year it was called iPhone 4.It was a good phone. Lots of bells and whistles. I loved the email, the phone, and the text messages. And the voice-recorder. If I had enough time, I'd play it back after I was asleep. I didn't need a new phone with a new phone number. I was used to the old phone number, but I was ready to switch.It was a great phone, but it lacked the one feature that made the iPhone 4 so great: the ability to make a silent recording of an outgoing phone call. When a call came in, it would play on the iPhone's small speaker. You could also use the phone as a phone. But you had to ask Siri, the Apple AI assistant running in the background, to put the phone on silent. I was surprised Siri didn't recognize the phone number I was calling as my own, with my own name on the phone. Or that it wasn't even a number in its own right. What did I call it? How did it work? What made it Siri that it remembered my voice and my name? Those were mysteries.But now, more than a year after Apple's debut, the smartphone that helped make the entire world more connected has grown up, grown old, and is now a relic of yesteryear. It has never been good enough, and maybe Siri will never be. Maybe Siri just can't get used to having the phone on its lap, or in its pocket rather than being slotted into the palm of your hand.I was going to tell you about the iPhone 6 Plus, the current iPhone’s big brother. It has a larger screen (up to 5.5 inches), a larger battery, and a faster processor. It has three cameras: one wide-angle lens, one telephoto lens, and a pair of tiny lens at the top and bottom.

Thousands of people filled Hong Kong's Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. The candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the Chinese ʻmiddle-groundʼ — a group of dissidents and academics that are often critical of both the CCP and the government — to pressure the authorities to give them visas to travel to Hong Kong.The Hong Kong government responded harshly to them, as it did to the pro-democracy protesters calling for an end to the violent crackdown. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong Police Department told the Hong Kong Free Press that the “Central Committee does not want any foreign groups (to) set foot in Hong Kong.”The Central Committee is the body that issues the edicts, decrees, and other instructions that guide the government's actions, including the actions of Hong Kong law enforcement. The group is known as the Communist Party's "highest organ" and oversees the government's control over the territory's citizens.Hong Kong police have been attacked by hundreds of masked men in Mong Kok, a neighborhood in Hong Kong's Kowloon district. At least 22 people have been injured, including one police officer, after masked assailants attacked the police station in the densely populated neighborhood. The incident took place outside of the police station in the Kwun Tong district. Police say the assailants threw metal bars at five officers, injuring one, and hit 15 other officers with their umbrellas, sticks, and bricks.The Hong Kong Free Press has obtained video footage revealing the events that led to the attack.The Hong Kong Police Department reportedly has a history of violent clashes with the government of the territory, including the attack on the Cheung Chau marina on Dec. 5, 2015. In 2014, the department had to deal with rioting in Mong Kok after hundreds of masked assailants raided the Cheung Chau police station, attacking police officers and others. The Hong Kong Police Department and its officers responded with lethal force.More than 20 activists received jail time after being convicted for their protests in last September's election against the sitting chief executive. The authorities sent three of the four to jail for two years, and have refused to release the fourth — Wong Yuk-cheung, who received a suspended two-month jail term — a decision that has ignited calls for his release by Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp.The four	0
A North Korean soldier on guard duty at the border dividing the two Koreas defected, telling authorities who received him in the South that he killed his superiors before fleeing across the  border to South Korea, and that the United States was behind his defection.When police found the soldier in a mountainous area about 50 km (30 miles) southwest of the city of Sariwon, he had told them that he was fleeing from North Korea's Kim Jong-un's regime as he was worried that Kim would kill him and wanted to take his family and escape to South Korea."He was very nervous and looked like someone with little sleep. He spoke with an accent and said he had escaped from North Korea a year ago, while he was there with his company," police said.He has since returned to North Korea and is being detained, the police said.The policeman who received him said he was a 21-year-old male, but his face was not visible on video footage he provided after he was surrendered by the soldier - who is believed to be the first defectant since a North Korean rocket blasted into the sea off the island of Pyongsong last August killing three South Korean sailors.The video showed a man in his early 20s, wearing a North Korean military uniform and armed with a pistol as he was led behind a guard post by an unknown man in civilian clothes.Two officials with the defector's family in Seoul said he had not told them where he was from, saying he just had said he was a North Korean soldier.A spokeswoman from the family's legal office said the soldier's return was good news for the country as it could help dispel doubts about the North's willingness to comply with South Korea's demand that it close all border crossings and ban the entry of North Korean soldiers and military officials.If he had been caught, it was impossible to verify such details of his defection when he had fled across the border, she said.South Korean defence ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said the soldier's defection would be fully investigated.The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Seoul says the number of defectors continues to rise as the authorities are trying to crack down on defectors in an effort to curb the number going to North Korea.At least 2,500 have defected since the border closed down in late March, according to South Korea	0
Monkeys and bananas. It's as natural a pairing as squirrels and nuts or movies and popcorn. Not any more, says one zoo in southwest England. Paignton Zoo in Devon is grabbing bananas out of its monkeys' hands, giving them leafy veggies and sprouts instead. This is no monkey-business diet fad, though. The zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys' health and can rot their teeth. "Bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories, and bear no relation to fruit grown organically," said zoo spokesman Philip Knowling. "Life in the wild is hard work and in a zoo you can sometimes look after the animals too well and it isn't good for their health." Thicker, better fur Humans can continue gobbling up their bananas, just keep them away from monkeys. "Sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys," Knowling said. "Animal nutrition has become a problem. Bananas and monkeys is a bit of a cliche, but they're not a good combination." The zoo has not been able to find a supplier for the kind of wild-grown bananas that would be more suitable for the monkeys, he said. So, it decided it was time to put them back on the shelf. The zoo has seen "definite changes" in the monkey's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet, Knowling said. "We've noticed a net improvement in their coat and their fur is thicker and better. Some of the smaller monkeys are less aggressive," he said. Thailand's annual 'monkey buffet' Diabetes risk According to the zoo's head of conservation, Amy Plowman, the bananas' high sugar content could cause the monkeys to develop diabetes or similar conditions. "It can also cause gastrointestinal problems as their stomachs are mostly adapted to eating fibrous foods with very low digestibility," she said. Zoos are getting smarter in the way they feed their captive animals. Rather than throw in ready chopped and prepared food, many now try to make the animals "work" for their calories by searching for scattered foodstuffs or doing puzzles to release treats. This is just the next step, Plowman said.	1
World record-breaking wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has announced he will retire from cricket at the end of the Australian summer. Adam Gilchrist takes a spectacular catch off Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the third Test against India.  Photograph: Andrew Benge/Getty Images"This is going to be the final year of my professional cricketing career. I think I've played with everything I've got in me and I've certainly had a few highlights. To play for that level of cricket is pretty special. People will always look back and say 'he played that great match', 'he made that happen' - and it's the most special I've ever played.""Being a professional cricketer is one of the toughest jobs in the world and I've got the highest respect for the guys that get up in the morning, put in the hard yards, get up at six o'clock in the morning and go through their day to put on a show for the people back at cricket grounds all over the country."I guess that's a lot of people who put their hand up and say 'I'm going to play for Australia and I'm going to put my heart and soul, and I may not get there right away but I'm going to give it all I've got to put a performance on a day to day basis. I'm going to do that for the love of the game'."I'm probably the one who has the hardest job in the world to find a way, with the resources we have, to get out there and give everything I have.

Police have arrested four students from Wesleyan University in connection with a drug overdose over the weekend. They are to appear in court next week. Ten students and two visitors were being treated for drug overdoses at the same time as the students at Wesleyan, which is on Long Island, New York.In the past day, three of the Wesleyan students have died.Arrest On Monday morning July 25, 2013, Wesleyan University police, based on information from members of the Wesleyan College community, began an investigation into the incident.Two students, who were attending parties of Wesleyan's women’s dorm, were found outside a dorm party with a strong smell of illegal drugs, including narcotics and other controlled dangerous substances. They were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.At a subsequent press conference, Wesleyan released information that they received a call from a student who said he was at the party.On July 26, Wesleyan University police received a phone call from a Wesleyan College student, who was at a local bar and said he was with a man, who had said that he had bought drugs from a student at the bar. They were able to talk with the student later.The students who attended the party and were found outside the party were charged with first-degree reckless endangerment.The Wesleyan University Police Department said that this investigation did not result in a single arrest, but the students who attended the party and were found on the streets were arrested.Investigation Police say the students attended the party on the last night of their junior year of college, and that a woman who attended the party was subsequently found dead of an overdose.Police searched the home of a Wesleyan student who owns the house where the party was taking place, but the search failed to locate any drugs or other evidence, said New York Police.The College’s Director of Communications, Michael DeBellis, stated that the university has "made this situation very, very clear that we have zero tolerance for anything like this." and that the students involved are not on campus.The police investigation will continue, and police confirmed via Twitter that they are looking into whether the students sold the drugs to another partygoer. The college did not immediately name the student who was found dead.Police also found evidence that the students were distributing drugs and	0
Imran Khawaja left London to train with a terror group in Syria last year and rose in the ranks, eventually appearing in one of its online promotional videos holding a severed head to the camera, authorities say. Sometime after he returned to the UK, Khawaja, 22, tried to leave from a different country and was refused a visa, so he came back to the UK in his ‘fishing gear’ and was arrested.The Home Office said Khawaja’s arrest is a reminder that those who join or support violent groups overseas face the risk of being detained and sent back home if they try to flee. It said he was held after going to Syria to train in the face of a “call to arms” by the “UK based Islamic State”.The Home Office did not provide details of whether Khawaja had been questioned before his arrest. And Khawaja’s lawyer said it was “impossible to know” what evidence he had provided to British officials.However, it has emerged that British police found a homemade bomb in his rented flat after he returned from Syria, and searched his mobile phone, where they found “images” from the Islamic State group.A further search of his email by two undercover officers revealed he had been discussing “hiding and leaving the country,” according to the Home Office.That evidence is thought to have been “the last straw”, said Khawaja’s lawyer, Michael Hodge QC.“The material they found is just like the information he is alleged to have provided to the authorities,” he said.If true, that would be “incredibly shocking”, he said.The Home Office said it is investigating Khawaja’s case and believes he was subject to a “well-founded fear of persecution”.The Home Office said it was “concerned at reports that in the same month as his return from Syria, a terrorist had attempted to enter the UK using a false passport” but said there was “no reliable information” to support that claim.However, an investigation by two undercover police officers found Khawaja’s email account had been hacked a few months before he travelled to Syria.In that email he	0
The sports complex that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's supporters call her most visible legacy as mayor of her hometown left the town paying inflated prices for the land and huge legal bills, according to court records. Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for. The complex features a soccer field, a running track and an indoor hockey rink with heated seats. Palin campaigned for a sales tax increase to finance the $14.7 million project, winning approval for the half-cent levy by a margin of 20 votes. Palin is now the Republican nominee for vice president. Her supporters call the arena the crowning achievement of her 1996-2002 tenure as mayor. "She really was very, very passionate about this right from the start," Wasilla Recreation Manager Bruce Urban said. But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits.  Watch more on the controversy » "When they started building, the title to the land was in my name," said Lundgren, who now lives in Panama. Diane Woodruff, a City Council member and longtime Palin critic, said that has left Palin's major campaign pitch -- to be a fiscally conservative reformer -- in question. "She inherited the city with no debt, and suddenly we have a lot of debt," she said. "I don't think that labels her as a true fiscal conservative." In 1999, the Nature Conservancy was negotiating to sell the land to the city and Lundgren, but he says that although he signed a purchase agreement with the group, the city did not. Lundgren purchased 325 acres from the Nature Conservancy, but the city filed a lawsuit claiming ownership of land it believed it owned. In 2002, a federal court sided with Lundgren, finding that the city had never signed the proper papers. But by then, the 80-acre complex was under construction; Palin gave the go-ahead to begin while the issue was still in court. After Palin left office, the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain, leading to another court battle. "I'm curious as to why somebody in the previous administration didn't make sure that we had clear title before we started building, because certainly once we started building, we were over a barrel," Woodruff said.	1
Well, that's one way to crowdsource. "Parks and Recreation" star Aziz Ansari tweeted Sunday that he was bored on a flight, and what followed had all of the makings of a Hollywood movie. The comic questioned why there has never been a film about a haunted plane: "Wouldn't that be dope?" He then started tweeting ideas and a script for a project he dubbed "Ghost Plane." Quicker than you could say "I'll make you a star," #GhostPlane took off. "Dude. For real. Is any studios into GHOST PLANE? I can make it cheap. It's all one location. Just the plane," Ansari tweeted. The idea goes like this, according to Ansari's tweets: "Open on Indian guy RAJ (Aziz Ansari) saying bye to his parents. He gets on the plane. But this plane is actually a GHOST PLANE. #GhostPlane." "Raj uses the plane washroom pre-takeoff. He sees a face in the mirror. 'This might be a ghost' he thinks.... #GhostPlane," the actor added. Don't even worry about casting. There's a role for Jennifer Lawrence as "Flight attendant Anne" and fellow Academy Award winner Tom Hanks as "The Captain." But our favorite character might be embodied in this tweet: "A mysterious man in a hoodie: 'If you want to stop the dolls. You need my help.' He lifts the hood: ITS LIAM NEESON AS HIMSELF! #GhostPlane." Because of course it's Liam freaking Neeson. Fans were really into it. On person tweeted, "Now I can't sleep because @azizansari is telling the most magnificent story #GhostPlane" while another said, "A studio needs to pick up @azizansari's #GhostPlane IMMEDIATELY. If not we'll just make a kickstarter. It'll be cheap." We will have to wait to see how it all pans out. Ansari said, "Sorry everyone. #GhostPlane is on pause. I just got home and have to be up early to shoot Parks. I'll try to finish this sometime." What a cliffhanger.	1
Their faces stare from old photos, their voices silent since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through Tacloban in the Philippines on Friday. At first Daisy Nemeth wasn't worried. Her family was close, they kept in touch. Soon, no doubt, she'd hear from her home in Hong Kong that all were safe. But three days later, that call hasn't come. Around 30 family members are missing. "It's my uncle, my mom's brother is missing. All his children, his wife, everyone. My cousin is missing with her six children, they range in age from 9 to 19. Then I have many, many other missing cousins. But these are the ones we're the closest with -- and they're nowhere to be found," Nemeth said. READ MORE: Survivors face grim struggle She'd be there in a heartbeat to look for them herself, she said, but at six months' pregnant and a mother to twin toddlers, there's no way she can go, even if she could find a way in. Instead, her family, some of whom are based in Denmark, has been trying to hire someone to go to Tacloban to search for them, but no one seems to want to go. "If no one can or is even willing to do it, I can't even begin to imagine the situation there," she said. "In the Philippines you can buy anything and anyone. I hate to say it but that's the truth. So if we can't even pay someone to go in and look for them..." Nemeth said, her voice trailing off. READ MORE: 'We just can't keep going' Nemeth's uncle, Rogelio Tan, is 68 years old and suffers from a severe learning disability. She's concerned for his safety if he's left to fend for himself. She says her uncle doesn't always make the most sensible decisions, and fears what could happen "if he doesn't have his children with him to make good decisions for him." Nemeth is checking Facebook pages where lists have been posted of survivors found in medical centers, and others are posting photos of lost family members in the hope that someone's seen them. One of the largest is "Tacloban (and nearby Waray Towns) Yolanda Update" where more than 17,000 users are swapping messages in a mixture of English and the local language, Tagalog. Among the pleas for help are stories of survival.	1
Eric Mace says he thought he was giving his daughter good advice by asking her to sit up front in class. Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at ÂThe Promise,Â an all-girls boarding school, in Charleston, S.C.Instead, the teenager died in the schoolâs cafeteria. Ryanneâs mother, Tammy Mace, and the studentsâ grieving parents say the shooting was in retaliation to the motherâs and sisterâs recent death.The story of the shooting, told through interviews with parents, classmates, educators and a police psychologist is part of an explosive new book by two Charleston journalists: James B. Nelson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter with the Charleston City Paper, and Rachel Scott, a University of Missouri-Columbia journalism professor who specializes in investigative reporting. The book, âThe Promise: How a Failing Boarding School Turned Around,â is scheduled for publication January 1.âItâs a chilling and frightening account of what they experienced as they came out of this school and tried to grieve their daughter,â said Nelson, who was shot in the leg in an early morning attempt to protect Mace Newsom and his students from the attack that killed 12 people. âBut itâs also a cautionary tale because there are probably many more places like The Promise now.âThere are already more than 70 schools like The Promise in the U.S., including the private St. Josephâs, based in Kansas City, Mo. The school was the site of one of the worst scandals ever to rock the nationâs public schools, when a teacher in 2012 was accused of sexually abusing nine students and three former students in its boarding school, according to Nelson. As of March 2013, St. Josephâs had had 40 confirmed or suspected cases of school-based sexual abuse, which is the highest reported rate of any private school in the nation.The problem was that St. Josephâs didnât report its accusations to law enforcement	0
Divining what is going in China's opaque political world is like reading tea leaves: it may be interesting but it's ultimately a futile exercise. The 18th Congress of the 82-million-member Chinese Communist Party, expected to happen in mid-October, will be a landmark event -- it will usher in a new generation of leaders to rule China for the next 10 years. Yet, little is known about what to expect. Some changes are imminent. Hu Jintao, the incumbent president and party general secretary, will step down and be replaced by Xi Jinping, the current vice president. Many members of the 25-member Politburo and the 371-member Central Committee are also expected to be replaced. These are the two policy-making bodies in the party's pyramid organization. Who will compose the post-Hu leadership? Speculation is rife. Who are the next generation of Chinese leaders? As the congress approaches, political maneuvering has increased among various camps, and there have been a few surprises already. Last week, Ling Jihua, head of the party's General Office, which runs the Leninist organization's day-to-day affairs and oversees security of the top leaders, was abruptly "reassigned" to the important but less powerful United Front department. Analysts say Ling, 55, may still be chosen for the Politburo, but he is out of the running for the all-important Standing Committee -- the very highest decision-making body made up of a handful of key leaders. Bo Xilai and the politics of Chinese succession "This is evidently a loss for Hu Jintao," said Bonnie Glaser, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank based in Washington D.C. "Ling Jihua was a Hu protégé. Who knows if it was related to the car crash?" In the early morning on March 18, Ling's son, Ling Gu, 23, was said to have smashed a black Ferrari into a concrete-wall on the side of Beijing's Fourth Ring Road while driving at high speed. Disgraced Party chief looms large over China's leadership Much was made of the incident in the media internationally, but much of this was rumor and speculation that CNN can not substantiate. Reports and discussions about it have been censored from the local media and Internet.	1
The report of a lethal chemical weapons attack unleashed by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21 was only the latest of more than a dozen such reports in recent months, according to Jon Day, the chairman of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee. "We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW on 14 occasions from 2012," he said in a two-page report to Prime Minister David Cameron. "This judgment was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the Joint Intelligence Organization of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources." If what Day described as "a clear pattern of regime use" of chemical weapons has indeed been established, why did the latest report spark a more bellicose response from world powers? Part of the answer lies in the scale of the event, in which hundreds of people are reported to have died, said Dr. Howard Hu, a consultant on chemical weapons for Physicians for Human Rights and dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. Opinion: Chemical weapons are a nightmare for Syrians In addition, the evidence is strong, he said. "This time, there was enough videotaped evidence of victims subsequent to the attacks to provide a level of detail that allowed observers like myself to see signs that were consistent with an acute response to a nerve agent. And that level of specificity, I think, also increased the level of certainty and urgency to this." Hu further cited the August 24 report by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders. It cited information from three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate that said some 3,600 patients had arrived at one of the hospitals within a three-hour time span showing neurotoxic symptoms, and that 355 of them died. "Medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to MSF doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions, excess saliva, pinpoint pupils, blurred vision and respiratory distress," said Dr. Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. Chemical weapons in Syria: How did we get here? Patients were treated with atropine, a drug that treats neurotoxic symptoms. Janssens said the group could neither confirm the cause of the symptoms nor identify who was responsible.	1

It's the largest producer of cocaine in the world and a key supplier of heroin to the United States. According to the CIA, Colombia produces 535 metric tons of cocaine a year, most of it for the U.S. market. The South American country has also been called "the Saudi Arabia of cocaine" for two reasons: it is one of the world's top producers of illegal drugs and it is a major transit point for cocaine destined for the United States.The United States has been waging war against cocaine since the middle of the 20th century. In the 1960s a federal narcotics task force was formed under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover.Since then, the CIA has played a vital part in combating drug trafficking worldwide. The CIA helped to bring Pablo Escobar to justice at the Old Bailey in London in 1993.In 2002, Colombian president Andrés Pastrana declared a "war on drugs" and ordered the arrest of more than 30,000 people. The U.S. government supported Pastrana's fight against drugs. In 2003, Colombia and the U.N. launched a war against drugs; a U.S. official claimed that 1,600 tons of cocaine were seized in 2002 alone.According to the BBC, in 2002 more than 9,600 people were arrested in Colombia's drug war. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported "the number of people killed in drug-related violence, often with U.S. and Colombia assistance, climbed to nearly 1,000 in 2003. The figure was more than double the number of men killed in the Iraq war."On December 17, 2008, Colombia's government announced that it would give up on its efforts to fight drugs. This decision was criticized by the United States, the United Nations, and a wide variety of Colombian groups and opinion leaders.## **Drugs in History**Before man discovered the secrets of the sea, it was known that he was a part of the natural order.—OdysseusThe use of drugs in history dates back thousands of years. Ancient cultures have used opium, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and tobacco.

When you're a patient, you trust you're in good hands, but even the best doctor or nurse can make a mistake on you or someone you love. "Mistakes are happening every day in every hospital in the country that we're just not catching," says Dr. Albert Wu, an internist at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Medical errors kill more than a quarter million people every year in the United States and injure millions. Add them all up and "you have probably the third leading cause of death" in the country, says Dr. Peter Pronovost, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The harm is often avoidable, and there are strategies you can use to help doctors and nurses get things right. Here's a list of 10 shocking medical mistakes and ways to not become a victim: 1. Mistake: Treating the wrong patient            • Cause: Hospital staff fails to verify a patient's identity.           • Consequences: Patients with similar names are confused.           • Prevention: Before every procedure in the hospital, make sure the staff checks your entire name, date of birth and barcode on your wrist band.           • Example case: Kerry Higuera 2. Mistake: Surgical souvenirs     • Cause: Surgical staff miscounts (or fails to count) equipment used inside a patient during an operation.     • Consequences: Tools get left inside the body.     • Prevention: If you have unexpected pain, fever or swelling after surgery, ask if you might have a surgical instrument inside you.     • Example case: Nelson Bailey 3. Mistake: Lost patients     • Cause: Patients with dementia are sometimes prone to wandering.     • Consequences: Patients may become trapped while wandering and die from hypothermia or dehydration.     • Prevention: If your loved one sometimes wanders, consider a GPS tracking bracelet.     • Example case: Mary Cole	1
Michael Jackson died while preparing to set a world record for the most successful concert run, but he unknowingly set another record that led to his death. Jackson may be the only human ever to go two months without REM -- rapid  REM (rapid  REM) -- sleep. Jackson's night-long REM "freezes" lasted from 9:30 p.m. June 17 until 6:00 a.m. June 21, 1977. His next-door neighbor woke him up in the morning and asked if he had spent all night sleeping. Jackson told him he had. As a result, his record for holding off REM sleep for two months went down to 9:30.It's hard to explain the significance of Jackson's record. It's just one of those things you're not supposed to talk about, but if you don't talk about it, who will? I've never made a record, but I have to think there must be something in the world like 15 people who have never made a record.... People talk about the Beatles and Elvis, but that's not all I've heard: I have heard a lot of people say it's not bad to be a world record. But I've never heard of a world record.Jackson was the first to hold off the REM sleep without benefit of drugs or surgical means. His record stood as long as the record stood.## **19. The  World Record Was Set**The "world" record for the longest stay of REM sleep came when Dr. George H. Averill, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, set the new record for the longest uninterrupted REM sleep of 28 hours, 14 minutes and 43 seconds on July 10, 1953, while he was at his clinic in Florida. Dr. Averill had been in the hospital for nine days, then at home for 24 more, when for the first time he had his night-long REM "freeze."## **20. The  Tape Recorder**The first recording of a person sleeping was made on January 28, 1953, when a Mr. John E. Robinson, who owned the first commercially successful tape recorder, set down on his bed to take a nap. Robinson wasn't one of the people who was making a recording tape to use on a commercial tape recorder, or was one of the many people who thought of	0
Ideally, Casey St. Clair would be spending Thanksgiving relaxing and eating dinner with her boyfriend and his family. Instead, the part-time Target employee and substitute teacher will work next year, and for one day, at least, won’t be the only Black working at the store.The announcement was made during Thursday's "State of the Union," broadcast by CBS News. The segment on the plight of Black workers at Target was followed by a segment by comedian Russell Simmons."If you’re looking for a job at Target and there are no Black people there, that’s a problem," Simmons said on Thursday. "If there are no White people there, that’s a problem. And if there are no women there, that’s a problem.""You know, they’re going to find somebody who will be Black and white and female and they’re going to take the job," he said.In a segment titled, "The Black-White Gap: We Need a Race-Change Strategy," Simmons noted that Black unemployment is higher than White unemployment. He did not mention that blacks are six times likelier to be employed full-time, compared to Hispanics and 12 times likelier to be employed part-time on a full-time basis, according to the U.S. Census."Race as an issue is not being brought up enough because they don’t see it as a problem," Simmons said. "I’m not saying that they’re not smart. They are smart. They’re just missing an opportunity to start taking those issues seriously."CBS News' Elizabeth Kornitz also interviewed a recent college graduate who now works at a local Target."Target had the same amount of Black faces (as) my school had, and they were treated better than I was as a Black person," said Casey St. Clair. "They don’t really want us there, and that’s the problem. We’re not doing anything to change why they don’t want us."The new store manager, who was hired in August, said that she doesn't think that the new store is "overwhelming.""If I were to find out that there would be a Black person that didn’t	0
Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student. "Ultimately we are pleased with the decision," said Lyle Kercher, Meredith Kercher's brother. "But it was not a moment of celebration. We are here because our sister was brutally murdered." The victim's sister, Stephanie Kercher, talked Friday about her family's grief. "Our lives have been on hold, really. You can't really carry on as normal," she said. "You have to take each day as it comes. It's not ever going to be the same without [Meredith]." Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder Friday after a lengthy, sensational trial. Knox was given a 26-year sentence; Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years. Both will appeal, attorneys said. Knox and Sollecito were convicted on all charges except theft. The pair was accused of staging a theft to cover up the killing. Authorities said 300 euros (about $444) was discovered missing from Kercher's purse. The pair must pay 5 million euros ($7.4 million) to Kercher's family. In addition, Knox must pay 40,000 euros (nearly $60,000) to a man whom she falsely accused of the killing. One of Knox's sisters said Saturday that Amanda "had a rough night." Her mother, Edda Mellas, said, "She had a lot of support. The inmates and the guards were all taking great care of her. They care a lot. "Amanda, like the rest of us, is extremely disappointed -- upset about the decision," Mellas said. "We're all in shock; we're all heartened by the support" that she said residents of Perugia and other Italians had shown. "People from all over the world have been sending us messages of support all through the night," Mellas said. "We told her she's going to get out of there. It's [just] going to take a little longer." Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, criticized his client's punishment -- less than the life sentence the prosecution requested but far short of exonerating Sollecito -- as making no sense.	1
Taryn Lopez doesn't think it got too terribly cold during the two days she was stranded on Alaska's Mount Mageik volcano. "I think about 28 degrees was the lowest we saw -- but then the temperature gauge was frozen," she said In a video on his blog, Scott Williams said the temperature gauge reading was recorded at 38 degrees the day he was there. "I was wearing layers because the temperature felt cold, but in reality it was much more like 40 degrees in that place," she said.Lopez took shelter in her bedroom when she was stuck high above the ground."It was so cold I couldn't get my feet out of my shoes. I was like, this is too cold," she recalled.Williams said their room was one large room with just enough room in front for him to stand in the doorway and she could lean out of the way."It was really creepy. It sounded like there were all these voices and if I kept going there wasn't much else I could do," she recalled.The sound of people talking and what she says sounded like there was a radio playing was constant throughout much of the two days that she was stranded."A lot of the time everything was silent. If you moved, you would make these little noises. I didn't know why they would do that or what they were doing. I didn't have no idea why things were going on but there was a lot of talk," she said.During the two days, she said she saw and heard things that she never would have thought would have been possible."When I looked down, there was all these little kids running around. It was scary because I was really afraid they were going to come up and attack me," she said.All of the children had the same color hair as her and that was unusual."That's what I remember most about Mt. Mageik," she said. "Just the kindness of everyone, all the kids that were there. I think people should be more aware of it and be kinder toward people because I believe that's what made it so terrifying," she said.A total of 26 people are confirmed with the flu in the state of Alaska, according to the Alaska Department of Community and Social Services. Of that number 8 have required hospitalization and 4 hospitalized people remain in the state's medical	0
No issue has been hotter throughout the run-up to the election than jobs -- and both candidates took pains to tackle the issue during their first debate Wednesday at the University of Denver. "Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 Â½ million jobs created," said Sen. Barack Obama. "We've added 3.6 million new jobs, more than any three-year period since the recovery began." "In fact, as we look ahead to the next election, we'll see tens of thousands of jobs created through the stimulus," said the next Democratic nominee. "In the coming months, Washington Democrats and Republicans must come together to create an economy that is strong enough to create jobs for all of our citizens." It's true, the economy has added jobs every month since the Great Recession began to end, but even after almost half a million jobs have been created, there has been little sign of any lasting growth in the economy.Advertisement:There are two important reasons why. First, a large share of the jobs created during the Bush administration have been in low-wage, service-industry work. A study by the Brookings Institution found that "since December 2006, we have shed 30 percent of the jobs that were created during the Clinton/Bush recovery. We are just barely past the halfway mark." The second reason is that low-wage jobs have been in such short supply in the United States that companies have had no choice but to lay off workers at will. "In the year that ended on Sept. 30, 2009, only 4.7 percent of the jobs added during the Bush years were at the level of the long-term unemployed," according to an analysis by the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). "This means that employers had to let the long-term unemployed go to get the jobs they wanted."What should be done? Obama talked throughout the debate about helping workers who, he argued, are "struggling to find a new job," by investing in programs like the H-1B visa program, which allows people from other countries to work for American companies temporarily. "We want to make sure that these people know that there is an exit ramp if they have a skill, they're willing to learn something new, they're willing to move on from a high-school equivalency job to a middle level job," he said. "That's how we create good jobs." McCain, by contrast,	0
Sebastian Vettel became Formula One's youngest world champion in a five-way shootout at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2010, and the German needs just one point in Japan this weekend to seal a  first World Championship since 2002."There are some races now in my career where the atmosphere is really important," said Vettel, who has won six races this season and is on course to secure an unprecedented fifth World Championship with second place in Japan."If I'm able to win the race, that will be a very happy day for me."I know the fans are really behind me."The whole city is behind this, because to win would be something really special for me."To win, if I want to win, it's not a problem."Vettel, whose win in the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the closest to a world title that any driver had ever managed in Formula One, has started the most races of any driver and has been on an incredible roll.Vettel's rise has been marked by incredible consistency and, more importantly, some major surprises - last weekend's win at the Australian Grand Prix at the expense of Kimi Raikkonen, for example, was a massive one.He had started from pole in the race and finished with another win, but had been frustrated by mechanical problems.Vettel had finished second in Malaysia and third in France, but had been involved in crashes in both races and his season so far had featured just one win.His win at the Australian Grand Prix was remarkable, but is also notable because of Vettel's unusual position as the last driver who starts and finishes in the same race, a position which requires Vettel to win his last race in the season with both the winner's and runner-up's points to count towards the World Championship.Vettel's win in Australia is likely to have increased his chances of securing the title by up to two points, but the German still needs to secure a win in Japan, where if he does so he will become the first driver since Michael Schumacher in 2002 to have competed in all five races of a season.Vettel has won in every one of his last 16 races and he won Australia as well as the previous two races, meaning he is on pace to equal Schumacher's record, but would	0
A soldier at an army camp in Indian-administered Kashmir killed five of his colleagues Thursday before turning his gun on himself, the military said. The soldier opened fire with an automatic rifle in the barracks of the camp in the town of Safapora, roughly 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the capital, Srinagar, said military spokesman Lt. Col. N.N. Joshi. An investigation into the shooting has been ordered, Joshi said. Kashmir is a mountainous region that has long been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan. Both sides keep large numbers of troops in the region. Since 1989, India has also been fighting against a violent separatist movement in the mainly Muslim area it controls, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people. Previous cases of members of the Indian Army and paramilitary forces in Kashmir turning their guns on their colleagues have taken place over the years. Authorities have attributed previous shootings to stress caused by long duty hours and protracted separation from families. Officials have introduced measures like long periods of leave and recreational facilities to try to tackle the problem. Journalist Mukhtar Ahmad reported from Srinagar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.	1
Yemen's information minister escaped an assassination attempt unharmed Tuesday, his office manager said. The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office Â when gunmen opened fire in front of his vehicle and attempted to run him over, said spokesman Saeed al-Ibrahim. The gunmen fled after the incident, Ibrahim said.The information minister's vehicle appeared to have been targeted by a rifle shot. The minister was not carrying a weapon at the time of the shooting. The incident took place at the entrance to the prime minister's office at 10:45 a.m., according to the minister's office. Three attackers were arrested in connection with the incident, Ibrahim said.Yemen’s Information Minister Ali al-Amrani will chair the government’s first special session to discuss efforts to end the country’s deadly civil war scheduled for Wednesday, a cabinet document released Sunday said.Al-Amrani will have the status of a minister-designate to the Cabinet of Ministers. He will chair the meeting at the invitation of President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi, the document stated.“The president is committed to maintaining the unity and stability of the state and has thus decided to convene a special session,” the document said.The opposition immediately announced the opposition would boycott the meeting, saying it would constitute a failure of democracy in the fight against corruption.Al-Amrani has been appointed as a special minister for the unification of Yemen, the cabinet document said. He would be appointed as a minister-designate to the Cabinet of Ministers to lead that body for the transition period.Al-Amrani has been at the forefront of the war effort against the Houthis. The information minister was the target of an assassination attempt earlier this month. He suffered a minor injury from the blast, though it did not keep him from delivering a speech at the United Nations General Assembly Â in New York.That speech, made in February, was a major success for the Yemeni government, particularly after the war started in earnest last year. Al-Amrani said he spoke about the need to establish peace talks to end the war after Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Yemen. The information minister’s main challenge now, he said, is that the war has moved from a civil war to a	0
Early Sunday, a massive fire at the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil killed more than 200 people. Nightclub infernos have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Here are some of the worst in recent memory: Are you there? Share ÂÂIn 2013, the club was at capacity for an average of 1.54 million people. The largest crowd was for the Brazilian group “Fenix.” The next year, it was a disaster for the country’s richest man, Eike Batista.The Kiss nightclub in Ipanema during an earthquake in 2015. Carlos EnzentillaThe Ipanema neighborhood is a hotbed for clubs and bars, a popular destination for young and old alike. On one of the most famous streets in the neighborhood, Ipanema Boulevard, an upscale club is just steps away from the beach and across the street from the famous Ipanema park.It is open to the public three nights a week, with a live band, free drinks, and a huge dance floor. But for seven nights a week, the club closes at about 2 a.m., leaving the neighborhood up in the air. In addition to the club’s main location in the neighborhood, three others are scattered around the city, including one in the Santa Teresa district near the beach, and another on the street where the club is located.The last Ipanema nightclub to close, in 2015, was called the Casa de Amor. Although the club has an open-air rooftop patio, it had no air conditioning, and the club’s closing time stretched to 2:30 a.m.It had been a long time since Ipanema had a full-time club. For decades, the neighborhood was mainly home to the “Café Brasil” nightclub, which was open every day until 5 a.m. The crowd, with a mix of young people and old, could be seen from the beach, and tourists could be seen drinking in the area from early afternoon to midnight.The last nightclub in Ipanema to close was, ironically, not a nightclub. The Casa de Amor, which was just a few blocks away on the corner of Aterro, closed its doors on this final night of the 2014 winter season. It was replaced by the Ipanema Nightclub, a restaurant with a rooftop	0
Fernando Torres' highly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record. Chelsea's website reported that the Spain striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the fee -- which British media speculated would be about £50 million ($80 million). However, it was still well short of the world-record $130 million that Spain's Real Madrid paid English club Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. In another deal confirmed late on Monday, Benfica said that Brazil defender David Luiz had joined Chelsea in a deal worth $34 million that saw Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic sign for the Portuguese club. "I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come," 2010 World Cup winner Torres told the London side's website. "Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season." The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League appearances for Liverpool after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2007 in a £20 million deal, netting 81 in 142 games in all competitions. Torres' move followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid. Just before the 2300 GMT deadline, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of £33 million ($53 million) that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008. Will deadline-day spending buck the trend? Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been relatively quiet in transfer market for the past two seasons, but has this time backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two marquee signings as his club languish fourth in the table -- 10 points behind leaders Manchester United. The London team also announced on Monday that the Chelsea FC plc made a loss of £70.9 million ($113 million) for the year ended June 30, 2010.	1
The life of a jockey is far from glamorous -- a world away from the confines of the rarefied, hushed atmosphere of London's National Portrait Gallery. It's a life of blood, sweat and mud-splattered silks and it's also a hazardous profession, with jockeys at frequent risk of serious injury. That gritty reality has been key to a photograph of jockey Katie Walsh winning a prestigious portrait competition featuring esteemed subjects like former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan. British photographer Spencer Murphy took the award-winning picture of Walsh -- sister of famed Irish jockey Ruby Walsh and the daughter of trainer Ted Walsh -- during a promotional shoot at Kempton racehorse. Walsh is pictured in the colors of the racehorse Seabass, who she rode to third in the 2012 Grand National steeplechase at Aintree. "I wanted to show both her femininity and the toughness of spirit she requires to compete against the best riders in one of the most demanding disciplines in horse racing," Murphy, 35, said in a statement after picking up the $19,000 Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize. "I chose to shoot the series on large format film, to give the images a depth and timelessness that I think would have been hard to achieve on a digital camera." It was a sweet success for Murphy, who was awarded third place in last year's competition. A black-and-white shot of Annan captured by Iranian photographer Anoush Abrar was in third place this time around. "In my mind it was clear what I wanted to do," said Abrar, who had previous experience of photographing Annan, "and this portrait took literally three minutes!" Runner-up was Giles Price for a portrait of a pilgrim and her baby at India's Kumbh Mela festival. The award ceremony took place at London's National Portrait Gallery, where a selection of the 5,410 entries will be on display until February.	1
Over the railroad tracks, near Agriculture Drive on the University of Georgia campus, sits a unique machine that may hold one of the solutions to big environmental problems like energy, food production and even global ills like climate change, waste and pollution. This machine could help to alleviate the effects of global warming, reduce the production of greenhouse gases, the United Nations’ official body for climate change, has found. The invention of the world’s largest solar panel by a former professor of the University of Georgia, Dr. George W. Ball, could reduce the need for fossil fuel consumption by 80 percentAccording to a recent study by the United Nations’ International Trade Center, a panel of specialists from different fields, like physics, ecology and medicine was asked to calculate how much energy could be saved from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if they were to use the energy of the sun to provide the energy to heat buildings instead of fossil fuels, which produce about 25 percent of the energy they use in the United States. The results showed that it would be possible to provide power with the equivalent of 10 million cars on the road using only the sun’s energy and therefore, the researchers concluded, that global temperatures could be reduced by 3.3 degrees Celsius above the current level.Dr. George Ball, an award-winning professor of physics who, together with his colleagues, invented the Solar Energy Tower, a large solar power tower, in the 1970s. His idea was to convert the sun’s energy to electrical energy using mirrors like an optical telescope. The scientists at the University of Georgia had an even larger solar power tower, which can store the energy for use during the day and then convert it in electricity during the night, when it is less hot.Today, the University of Georgia is one of the highest consumers of electricity in the state and it is responsible for over 50 percent of the energy consumed in the Atlanta area. Dr. Ball got the idea to use the energy of the sun to heat buildings or to provide heating in case of power cuts from the sun. Dr. Ball became known as an internationally known energy researcher and was asked to develop a way of utilizing solar energy.“We had a solar heater that was an open structure,” Dr. Ball said. “We looked at it and said, ‘This is too big. We have no way of storing this power.’ We said, ‘	0
Keep your kids away from these Santas! Bar-goers dressed in Christmas-themed costumes descended upon hundreds of cities worldwide Saturday for the annual bar crawl known as Santacon. ÂCrowds of Santas have been seen at bars, restaurants and shops across the globe since 2011. There are more than 12,000 Santa and Snowflake locations across North America including North Pole, California. Thousands of Santas attend Santacon each year in every U.S. state. This is the largest annual event for Santas, and by far the largest event of its kind worldwide.ÂThe event is organized by the North Pole Santa Claus Association, Inc., an independent nonprofit organization, whose mission is to "enhance Santa's global reputation through recognition, advocacy and public relations" and to offer the gift of "celebrating the magic of Christmas to children around the world through the power of SANTASHEEN."The Santa Claus event is a fun and educational day for children, adults, parents, friends and fans. During Santacon, Santa Claus and his elves visit dozens of cities across North America, where they deliver toys, gifts, holiday music, games and much more. ÂEach year, a new theme and look for the Santas is announced, and each location has a unique theme and look.Santacon is an annual event that has been taking place since 2011. Santa Claus is making his first appearance in the city of Chicago and has performed more than 7,600 events in more than 500 cities to date!

The websites of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and of El Al, the Israeli airline, were brought down Monday morning by an apparent hacking attack. An internet hacker who calls himself Ox Omar sent an e-mail to the Jerusalem Post Monday in which he claims that together with a hacking group calling themselves "Nightmare" that the websites of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and that of El Al would be brought down. Idit Yaaron, the spokeswoman for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, told CNN that the main site of the stock exchange where the trading takes place was not harmed and operates on a very high level of Internet security. Trading has continued unaffected, she said. A secondary internet web site was affected for a short period of time. El Al spokesman, Ran Rahav, released a statement saying, "El Al is aware that for the past two weeks a cyber war is raging against Israel. The company is closely monitoring the Saudi hacker activity. El Al is taking precautions regarding its website and as a result there may be disruptions in the activity of the website." The "cyber war" started at the beginning of the month when a group claiming to be Saudi Arabian hackers posted the credit card information and other identifying data of thousands of Israelis on line, prompting an international investigation. "Hi, It's Ox Omar from the group xp, largest Wahhabi group of Saudi Arabia" read a statement posted on an Israeli sports web site the group hacked into. "We are anonymous Saudi Arabian hackers. We decided to release (the) first part of our data about Israel." Wahhabism is an Islamic religious movement. The Bank of Israel released a statement last Tuesday saying that, based on information from credit card companies, only around 15,000 credit card numbers were exposed and those credit cards were blocked for use in Internet and phone purchases. Yoram Hacohen, who heads the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the Israeli Ministry of Justice, told CNN in a phone interview on Friday that he is more concerned about the private information that was released than the actual credit card numbers; he fears that the publishing of e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home addresses could lead to identification theft. Hacohen said that hacking is a criminal act against citizens and the Israeli authorities have begun a criminal investigation, including a computer forensic probe to search for electronic evidence in an attempt to locate the group. The theft of personal information is a criminal act under Israel's Privacy Protection law.	1
Beyond the noise of raucous crowds and angry protesters who have turned town hall meetings into shouting matches is genuine concern from ordinary citizens who are afraid that President Obama's health care proposals would only make things harder for them, experts say. The battle over health care reform has energized people on both sides of the debate. "The reason that we see these protests and people asking tough questions at town hall meetings is because they feel like the president is going to take something away from them. That motivates people. That gets them out," said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Those fears were heard Tuesday at Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter's town hall meeting in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. "This is going to take away my freedom," charged one man who wanted assurance from Specter that the private option for health insurance would stay viable. Specter repeated Obama's pledge, telling the crowd, "If you like your policy, you can keep it." Acknowledging the skepticism at a town hall meeting Tuesday, Obama tried to alleviate fears that reform would take something away. "I recognize there's an underlying fear here that people somehow won't get the care they need. You will have not only the care you need, but also the care that right now is being denied to you, only if we get health care reform. That's what we're fighting for," he said at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, event. Since his days on the campaign trail, Obama has promised the public that those who like their health insurance plans won't have to give them up, but he's stopped short of saying at what cost. "I think that's the fear," said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University. "Even though they are going to keep the plan, the plan is going to be at a much greater cost. And he's not been able to really allay that fear."  Watch what happened at Specter's town hall meeting » The themes coming up at town hall meetings across the country are broadly the same as doubts expressed during the campaign. Critics are voicing fears about socialism and the dismantling of the government they are used to. And those who have sufficient health care coverage worry they'll have to foot the bill for reform, echoing concerns heard during the presidential campaign that Obama would "spread the wealth around."	1
More than 300 wounded Libyans will arrive in Germany to be treated in hospitals within the next 10 days in an operation approved by Libya's interim government, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday. "Our expectation of the amount of the wounded Libyans treated in German hospitals changes each hour," said Thomas Holz of the German health service Almeda. According to Almeda's marketing chief Michael Blasius, the company expects the number of Libyan patients to rise. Already, 111 Libyans who arrived in 20 planes are receiving treatment in German civilian hospitals. Four further planes were expected to land in German territory Friday. "Some of those patients will be transferred to countries like France, Great Britain, Turkey and the U.S.," Blasius told CNN on Friday. The United States plans to provide treatment for at least 28 wounded Libyan fighters. U.S. officials said Thursday that at least 24 would be taken to a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, because their wounds cannot be treated in Libya. An additional four will go to U.S. medical facilities in Germany, according to Major Janelle Jeffrey of the U.S. Africa Command, based in Stuttgart, Germany. Libya's National Transitional Council requested the U.S. medical treatment, which is being offered as a humanitarian gesture and support for Libya's democratic aspirations, U.S. officials said. Almeda said it received the health service request by Libya's new Finance Ministry on October 14. Four days later, the first military plane arrived in Germany with dozens of wounded Libyans. That was a day after German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler announced Germany would offer medical help to the NTC. Three so-called "scouting teams" are currently screening Libyan and Tunisian hospitals, searching for heavily injured Libyans who might benefit from treatment abroad. Almeda told CNN there would be two further scouting teams in Tunisia and Libya at the beginning of next week. Many wounded Libyans had already received treatment in Tunisia, according to Blasius. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy in Washington and Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin contributed to this report.	1
The Supreme Court on Monday tossed out a provision in Arizona's voter registration law that required proof of citizenship. The 7-2 majority said the state's voter-approved Proposition 200 interfered with federal law designed to make voter registration easier. The state called the provision a "sensible precaution" to prevent voter fraud. Civil rights group countered that it added an unconstitutional and burdensome layer of paperwork for tens of thousands of citizens. Justice Antonin Scalia said the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 "forbids states to demand an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the federal form." But in a nod to state authority, he said the federal law "does not prevent states from denying registration based on any information in their possession establishing the applicant's eligibility." The appeal was a classic federalism dispute, on the often delicate line between conflict and cooperation between state and federal governments over enforcing voting procedures. During last year's election, there were numerous court challenges to state voter identification laws at the polls. The current fight has produced a range of states, lawmakers and advocacy groups on both sides on the gateway issue of registration. The Obama Justice Department opposed the Arizona law, which went beyond what other states have done to ensure integrity in the registration system. Arkansas governor rejects voter ID measure Retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizona native, was among those who attended the spirited April oral arguments. National Voter Registration Act Justice Anthony Kennedy a year ago blocked the Arizona law from being enforced, while the high court decided internally whether to accept pending appeals for review. The ballot measure was passed in 2004 and has been lingering in the federal courts ever since. The Constitution's Article I says "the times, places, and manners of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature." But Congress is also given the power "to make or alter such regulations." Federal lawmakers did just that, passing the National Voter Registration Act two decades ago, which has since been called the Motor Voter Law, designed to streamline election participation. It requires states to have any application for a driver's license treated also as a voter registration -- the "motor voter." And it requires states to "accept and use" mail-in and in-person applications. A federal Election Assistance Commission was created to produce a nationally uniform voter application form, which states must use. Any extra state instructions, or "add-ons," must be approved by the commission.	1
It might sound like a Vin Diesel movie, but tennis authorities in Australia are hoping that the FAST4 format, which debuted Monday with an exhibition match between world No. 2 Roger Federer and former Wimbledon and  US Open champion Lleyton Hewitt, will help make the sport more inclusive and less exclusive."Australia has a long tradition of tennis on grass, and so to see a world-class player and champion like Federer competing on grass is a dream come true for Australian sports fans," tennis Australia chairman Peter Bell told the Herald Sun.The Australian Open champion who is a regular in the Top 100 of the ATP World Rankings, has been a tennis enthusiast since he was a little boy in Sydney and has his favourite players."A few years ago, I was really excited to see how the sport was evolving in the United States, but it was really different back home," he said. "I think tennis now is a real sport for the masses because of technology."We know how hard it is to become a champion if you're not a top player."With the emergence of FASTA, a system that uses technology to allow players to play several rounds of matches simultaneously instead of going to court as many times as the court has points, the competition to become No. 1 or No. 2 player would become a much more exciting one, says Tennis Australia."If you look at the Australian Open now, it's not about who is ahead in the rankings or who is a better player," said Bell. "The Australian Open's a big event in world sport - with two weeks of tennis."We want to see a high quality tournament. So we looked at how could we add more sports to the Australian Open like basketball, rugby or soccer. And it's not been a problem because we can do it within the rules. And the Australian people have embraced it."We used FASTA to add football to the Olympic Games in Sydney and it was a huge success. The biggest thing now is FASTA gets more people playing because they can play several matches in a day."Bell said the tennis authorities have been listening to the suggestions of the fans, who have asked for tennis to become more inclusive."They want tennis to be more inclusive so that anyone can play it and compete in the tennis community," he said.

While all eyes seem to be on "Slumdog Millionaire" for the Oscars, one very courageous little girl will be focused on another India-based film at the ceremony. Pinki, like millions in developing countries, had to live with her deformity and suffer the social consequences. It's called "Smile Pinki," and it's up for an Oscar, too -- nominated for best short documentary, which it won on Sunday. The little girl watching it from inside the Oscar ceremony has traveled all the way to Los Angeles, California, from her small Indian village with her dad -- and it has been an incredible journey for Pinki Sonkar. "Smile Pinki" tells the story of her transformation from a sad outcast to a vibrant 8-year-old with plenty of spunk. Pinki was born with a cleft lip, and her impoverished family did not have the money for corrective surgery. Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries, Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences. Her father Rajendra Sonkar says: "She used to go to school and the kids would not befriend her. She would say, 'I don't want to go to school.'"  Watch how Pinki was transformed by the operation » "Pinki was a depressed, sad, lonely, shy, young little girl, growing up on the periphery of the society in a little village," said Satish Kalra, director of Smile Train's South Asian region, after meeting with Pinki. The little girl's own family was ashamed of her, Kalra says. But all of that has changed. Pinki is now a real pistol, full of energy and confidence, and she has a fantastic smile too -- thanks to the Smile Train charity. Smile Train teaches doctors in their own countries to operate on cleft lips, a deformity afflicting up to four million children across the world. iReport: Share your Oscar predictions Pinki just happened to be one of the chosen candidates for surgery and was also chosen to be the subject of the documentary. The film chronicles her transformation, following her from her village to the hospital and home again. "She has absolutely and totally changed," said Pinki's surgeon, Dr. Subodh Kumar. The film's director is Megan Mylan. She has won several awards but not an Oscar -- until now.	1
A pharmacy tech who makes $12 an hour but drives a Mercedes. A rumor that a pharmacist may be trading sex for drugs. A prescription note with handwriting that's a little too easy to read. The Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta says all of Â which is not the same as saying that pharmacies are all safe.The DEA has recently received numerous reports of the problems, most of them from pharmacists at pharmacy chains and independent pharmacies. For years, they have complained that their complaints to the DEA have gone unheeded.The most common issues are the same ones that have been discussed in the news and on the Internet for months.They are the same problems faced by Americans across the nation: Drug overprescribing.Pharmacists are overprescribing drugs to their patients because they are too scared to report the problems. They are afraid that they will lose their jobs or face prison time for violating the law.Drug overprescribing happens when a pharmacist writes a prescription for a drug that is known not to be safe for the patient. That prescription is then used by the patient to self-treat a medical condition, such as arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes and allergies.Sometimes the pharmacy will prescribe a drug that has not been approved for a disease or medical condition the patient is taking to treat. Sometimes the pharmacist will prescribe a drug only after consulting with a doctor. That prescription is then used to self-treat a medical condition.And sometimes the prescription is given before consulting a doctor, as an attempt to save on the cost of the drug.In some instances, the doctor's treatment of the patient is so costly that the pharmacist can't afford to prescribe a drug to the patient.In other instances, the doctor's treatment of the patient is so inadequate that the pharmacist can't afford to prescribe a drug to the patient. Often, the patient can't afford to go to a doctor; they make their own decisions about their health care.The prescriptions may be filled in pharmacies that are operated by the pharmacist or by independent pharmacies. The practice of prescribing prescription drugs outside the bounds of a licensed practitioner may be illegal, but in practice the practice is becoming more and more common.Because of the way these drugs are prescribed, physicians are reluctant to prescribe them. And patients are willing to take these drugs themselves. Their	0
Long before he was accused of murder, Oscar Pistorius was toasted the world over for his triumph over a disability. His lightning running speed -- which took him all the way to the Olympics despite using carbon legs -- attracted ersatz comparisons to that of the legendary sprinter Jesse Owens, while commentators hailed him as the best sprinter on the planet since Owens himself.Now the "Blade Runner" has been charged with premeditated murder in a case that, until a few weeks ago, was known only to him. He's accused of killing his girlfriend, 29-year-old Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day. Pistorius has been under intense pressure regarding the case since it was announced in January, when he was forced to appear in a gynaecological examination after his release from prison in South Africa and was placed under house arrest. The South African prosecutor has said that he believes Pistorius is a likely suspect and will be formally charged with murder at a later date."I have been informed that we have the wrong man and the investigation is not over," Pistorius's legal team said in a statement on Monday. "My client maintains his innocence and says there is no reason to believe that any crime has been committed. He expects a thorough investigation, in which he will be given the opportunity to give his version of events to the grand jury."As Pistorius goes through the court proceedings, it's clear that his legal team is aware of the scrutiny surrounding his case, and that they have attempted to address this by making Pistorius and his family available for interview during the court processes."We wanted to speak to him but realised that we needed to talk to his family first before we could ask him questions to do with the investigation," a source close to the case told me earlier today."We were very concerned at the beginning about the way we chose to handle the media. His family were not comfortable that we would put that out until it was absolutely needed."In the first few weeks, one of Pistorius's team were aware of news of the ongoing investigation through the media, even though they were not entirely aware of the particulars of what was said. One source told me that they had received information that the South African prosecutor was preparing to charge Pistorius with murder."There were other people around the table who were aware of the situation. But we were not made aware of the	0
The trail of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has led investigators to the New Hampshire home of a former Chechen rebel living in exile, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday. FBI agents interviewed Musa Khadjimuradov and searched his Manchester home this week, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While the official did not detail what investigators uncovered during the search or the contents of the interview, Khadjimuradov indicated in an e-mailed statement to CNN that he was questioned about his contact with dead suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities have cast a wide net in the investigation into the Boston bombings, examining everything from the suspects' movements to people they knew, to determine whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev or his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, received help in carrying out the attack. "I am sure the FBI knows by now that I have nothing to do with the terrible act in Boston," Khadjimuradov said in the statement. "I would like to state that I barely knew the Tsarnaev family, and only met them for the first time after we moved to the U.S. During the very few encounters, which were initiated by Tsarnaev, we have never discussed political or religious issues, so I could never guess what ideas were in their minds." What we know about Chechnya Khadjimuradov, 36, said this week was the second time he has been questioned by federal authorities about his relationship with the elder Tsarnaev, who visited his home about three weeks before the April 15 bombings that left three dead and hundreds wounded. Investigators first talked to him on April 29, he said. In an interview this week with Voice of America, Khadjimuradov said he believes federal investigators questioned him because they wanted to know whether Tsarnaev had used a shooting range in the area. "Because they say he has shooting practice here in New Hampshire. That's like two or three times. So he bought fireworks here, from New Hampshire, you know? And he buy some ammunition for guns here in New Hampshire. And before the attack, like three or four weeks, he came to my house," he said. Suspect: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims "So now I believe they're thinking like he was coming here to New Hampshire and that I try to help him or something."	1
Call David X. Cohen a nerd all you like, but never call him a geek. To the co-creator of "Futurama," the term "nerd" is a compliment. "I feel like with 'nerd culture,' [it sounds like] the vernacular is kind of like a way of describing an intellectual," he says. "It's just taking something like 'cool' to the next level, where it takes it to another level. I feel like this [term] is kind of like that."Cohen, a 33-year-old father of three from Queens, NY, is a writer and co-creator of "Futurama," the surreal live-action series that has been shown on the Cartoon Network since 2000. "I feel like [the word nerd] is on the verge of a linguistic takeover," he says. "'Futurama' came out in the '90s and everything we do is now considered 'nerd.' When we talk about 'nerd culture,' we're kind of talking like 'cool' culture. But the truth is, no one is really nerdier than we are. I mean, we are nerds when it comes to our interests, but we also have [kind of] outgrown it."He says that when he was in high school, he was a typical nerd: He had no interests outside of football, video games, and comic books. "I don't even think I had a good haircut," he laughs. "I just remember being that kid who had this really bad haircut, and people didn't seem to care that I was in the library. I didn't have any friends. I didn't go to the prom. But a couple of the guys in the drama club would sit with me after class and they would talk about 'Star Trek,' they would go to the library and they would watch 'Star Trek,' and they would talk about their science fiction shows."Cohen and his friends' activities and interests came from their parents. "I think my dad was a really smart guy; he always brought home these great ideas," he recalls. "That's why I would ask him to tell me stories. I would have to sit on the couch and listen to stories that made no sense and ask him to tell them to me." But Cohen says he doesn't have to do those things anymore.Cohen says he doesn	0
President Barack Obama on Monday reminisced of better times with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, his onetime hug-buddy turned Republican antagonist as the governor has turned his focus to an ersatz candidacy and an ongoing probe of the George Washington Bridge lane fiasco.In the last year and half, the president has spent several weekends with Christie, most recently at his Bedminster, N.J., summer home since Christie moved into the White House.President Barack Obama is set to celebrate his 41st birthday in a few weeks with a big party at his home in Washington, D.C. (NBC/WJLA-TV)Obama and Christie got to know each other in early 2010 when Christie was in a tight race to succeed Barack Obama when he left the Senate. The two men had a good rapport and got to know each other very well during Obama's entire administration, which has seen the two men share plenty of political highs and lows. The two men were also friends on the campaign trail, but have not seen eye-to-eye on matters like immigration and gun policy for years.The presidential pal took to Twitter.“Happy birthday! It’s your birthday.”A few days later, Obama posted a lengthy Facebook post about his birthday."It's my birthday tomorrow," he wrote. "Happy birthday and thank you to all of the people who helped make my election victory possible. From the first person who voted for me to the people I've had the great honor to have worked with and call friends, I am so deeply grateful for the hard work and dedication of ALL OF YOU."The president, who is still mourning the death of his mother, said he looked forward to seeing friends and supporters at the White House on Wednesday.The president's Facebook post on Friday, with an image of a man next to a globe and a red rose, received more than 1.5 million "likes," while his tweet -- which was later deleted -- received more than 60,000 retweets.On Monday, the president said that he was looking forward to celebrating his birthday with Christie and also with his daughters while he was in Washington."I’m looking forward to spending my birthday with some of my closest friends," the president wrote on Twitter. "And I’m looking forward to spending it with my family as well."	0

Those arrested were Âtwo Mexican nationals in their 20s, who are alleged to have been employed by and in close and ongoing concert with the Greeley Police Department to protect and transport illegal drugs, firearms and illegal aliens, and were allegedly involved in gang related activities.â€A 22-year-old man, an 18-year-old woman, and a 24-year-old woman surrendered to police. A 38-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were being sought by authorities.Greeley Police Chief David Flanders said that the manhunt began Monday night with an anonymous tip, which led authorities to a Greeley apartment building, where 15 people were believed to be present.â€œPolice conducted a search of the building, and during the search, they encountered three subjects who were armed with handguns, and one who had a rifle. Officers also learned that the subjects were driving a silver 2001 GMC Van that was stolen approximately two weeks earlier at a Greeley pawnshop,â€ said Flanders.Officers also learned that the suspects were being tracked by Mexican national Miguel Angel Torres-Garcia, the Greeley Police Department said.â€œThe subjects were arrested on felony drug charges, a charge that they will face in U.S. District Court in Denver,â€ said Flanders.Police say the manhunt continued Tuesday, when a man believed to be a gang leader was shot at.â€œThe incident occurred about 7:45 p.m. in the 200 block of East Balsam Way, and police received the call of an armed subject firing approximately three rounds at a vehicle.

Two people aboard a twin-engine airplane were killed Saturday when it crashed into a house in western Pennsylvania, sending the homeowner fleeing with his dog, officials said. Westmoreland County Public Safety spokesman Dan Stevens said skies were clear when the aircraft "just spun in its own axis" and hit the Saltsburg area house, sparking a fire that consumed the plane and the house. The plane took off from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport outside Latrobe, about 50 miles from the crash scene, Stevens said. The Beechcraft Baron BE58 crashed 11 minutes later at 9:19 a.m., FAA spokesman Jim Peters said. The six-seat plane landed next to a man who was sleeping on a couch with his dog in the home, Stevens said. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette identified him as Steve Yanko. "There was somebody on his shoulder this morning," Stevens said of Yanko, who told him he was only about 15 feet away from the plane's impact. Yanko's wife was not at home at the time, Stevens said. The county coroner will identify the two victims and their names will be released after next of kin are formally notified, officials said. Stevens said the experienced pilot of the plane had recently purchased the aircraft and was at the controls. The other individual was an instructor who was flying along to ensure the owner was comfortable with the twin-engine plane, he said. The FAA's Peters said he could not confirm the role of the two people onboard. The FAA was on scene Saturday. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board will arrive Sunday.

Beau Willimon has learned a key characteristic to succeeding in both politics and entertainment: not revealing too much. The "House of Cards" creator, show runner and primary writer talks freely about his show, which concerns a  politician whose wife is running for mayor. "You can see how he's constantly trying to make sure he doesn't get hurt and not get himself hurt," he says. "The people around him are the ones that really get hurt." Willimon also reveals how he got into writing, as well as how he learned to be a good actor.It turns out he's a self-taught actor who made a name for himself in just two years of acting on TV. "I was a freshman at UCLA in 1990, and I actually got a part in a TV series called 'Life Goes On.' And I had to play a guy who works as a car salesman, and there was this really awkward scene in which he meets this guy on a bus, and they've known each other since high school, and they just have a crush on each other. And I had to do that. And so I ended up having to take a semester off from college and do that. And that's how I got into acting."Willimon also talks about his work on both House of Cards and The West Wing, and says that the latter has a great effect on viewers. "I was watching The West Wing, the first thing I did was watch the first episode. And the second episode I watched and said, 'I really want to do that again.' And I knew the second was the one that got me off the ground in terms of the actual show, in terms of the process of writing and producing and being able to watch a character, and how the characters change throughout the series, and how they affect the show. The first time I didn't do that. And then when the second time I did was like a really special one, but I did go back to watch the first episode after I saw the second one, and I was just like, wow. And then when I saw the third, I was like, I really want to do that again. And I watched the third episode, and I was like, this is so much fun and interesting to write and be involved with. And I was just like, I really want to keep working."In the past, Willimon has worked on his own shows, including "D	0
Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors have dropped charges against an 18-year-old man accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in July at a Keith Urban concert south of Boston. "Given the state of the evidence, the case was dismissed in the interest of justice," said Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney. Sean Murphy was charged with rape after an incident that happened in front of a large crowd on the lawn of the Xfinity Center, an outdoor amphitheater in Mansfield, Massachusetts, on July 26. Multiple people recorded what happened on their cell phones and provided video to authorities for their investigation. Murphy entered a not guilty plea in court and was released on $10,000 bond. His attorney had always maintained his client's innocence. "Put simply, this was a consensual act, not a sexual assault," lawyer Steven Brooks said at the time. "This was a private act that regrettably occurred in a public place." "Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I am sure the young woman does as well. The young woman was neither intoxicated nor overcome by drugs at the time. Mr. Murphy has no criminal history whatsoever." Fans hospitalized after 'nutso' Keith Urban concert About 18,000 people attended the concert in Mansfield, about 30 miles south of Boston. More than 20 people were hospitalized after the concert, police said. Another 50 were taken into protective custody, and several others were arrested over "alcohol-related issues," local authorities said. "In total, fire and EMS attended to 46 medicals resulting in 22 transports mostly alcohol-related," Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon and Fire Chief Neal Boldrighini said in a joint statement. "Police dealt with a steady stream of intoxicated persons as well, resulting in over 50 people being taken into protective custody and a number of others arrested for alcohol-related issues." CNN's Alan Duke, Mayra Cuevas, Todd Leopold and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.	1

An altercation at a Texas community college Wednesday afternoon escalated to gunshots and a _______, according to police.The police report indicates that a man and woman were walking to class near South Park College when they were accosted by a group of three people at about 3 p.m. in the campus parking lot. While waiting for the woman to arrive, the man was also confronted by the same people.The men approached one of the students, a woman, and asked her to join them, according to the police report. One of the men allegedly punched the woman twice in the face, causing her to trip, jump over a fence and fall to her death.The other man and woman attempted to flee the scene before police arrived. When the officers arrived, they took the reports, a photograph to identify the suspected killers and then conducted their investigation, police said.Police said that witnesses observed the man and woman fighting over their respective cellphones.

Video from bystanders showed the man and woman fighting, with a man standing behind the woman and striking her in the back of the head as she was on the ground. Police said that the man was identified but they couldn’t immediately identify him on account of the darkness of the evening.Police said that they found a gun on the man on campus who was said to have shot the woman in the head at least once.

A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday. Cleveland Clinic doctors  the transplant from a woman with a severe facial disfigurement to a woman with no disfigurements.The woman was the first in the world to have a transplant of a total face, according to the Cleveland Clinic's chief of facial plastic and reconstructive plastic surgery Joseph M. Piacenza."I think it's amazing that we're doing this," he said.The patient arrived at the Cleveland Clinic in February 2016 through the hospital's "Transplant in the Trenches Program," he said.She was on the operating table when the transplant was done by Piacenza and his team.Piacenza said that by combining the two individuals' faces, the operation will allow the woman to see out and not as much of her scar tissue will be visible."It will still be a huge problem, but the scar tissue from her face will be hidden — it will not be obvious," he said.Piacenza said the woman's doctors had told the family that after her operation she would be able to regain some of her physical function, her ability to smile and even talk for a time."[Now] she's going to have a face that doesn't have any problems," he said.Piacenza said the woman, who he did not identify, was treated for a congenital facial disfigurement when she was born. She was left with both eyes partially closed, with her nose and mouth distorted, and she has no lip or chin.After her medical care, her family told Piacenza about possible options. He called the patient's doctors, who told him about transplant options, and contacted a surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic."I think the hardest part right now is to let them know that she's there, and that she wants to open up the world," he said.Piacenza first met the patient in July 2015, when they were discussing her possible future with her nose in an effort to make her more comfortable."There were some moments when I thought I wouldn't make it," she said.Later, the woman told Piacenza that she would like to	0
After learning that Ashton Kutcher had landed in the hospital trying to follow Steve Jobs' all-fruit diet, CNN reader Sumday had just one question: "All I really wanted to know was why this diet was bad?" Jobs first fell victim to the diet and admitted himself to the hospital on September 11, 2005 in Cupertino, California. He could not be woken up by phone call. The first question for his wife, Laurene, was whyhe did not go in for traditional treatment like chemotherapy, which could have given a much longer life. When Laurene finally got hold of Jobs, he kept saying how sorry he was.It took Laurene over an hour to get Steve Jobs to the hospital.Sumday, a lawyer, took a deep breath before trying her question. "All I really wanted to know was why this diet was bad?" Her question had only two parts: "Why" and "Why?" When her phone answered, she was relieved.She was talking with someone who did not want to be revealed. Sumday was then told, "You wouldn’t want this to get out." They went on to speak about the cancer treatment and Steve Jobs' diet. The caller asked, "What were they doing?"Sumday asked the caller if he had any idea why he wanted to give Steve Jobs a diet,which she described as "not diet, that’s stupid." Sumday said that he never said hewanted to give Steve Jobs a diet. To Sumday, it sounded that the caller wanted to besure that the information was not released. She asked if he had been paid to do this.She asked the caller if he knew anything about why it was a bad diet. The caller paused for a few seconds before saying, "No, I don’t."Sumday looked into the caller’s eyes. "I’m going to assume that you don’t knowwhy it is 'bad' and 'not a good diet.'" Sumday said, "Okay." The caller went on to tell her that it was very bad for Steve Jobs to exercise and said that he had been atthe hospital for many hours. He said he had been trying to do a lot of exercises, butthey	0
Allow us to take a moment to recognize Wiz Khalifa as the new king of #selfies. According to TMZ, last Monday, he took to the stage at Billboard’s Party in the Poconos to take a selfie with allof his friends. (It’s apparently not the first time.) His next step: the “Z-R-O-R-I-P-A-M-O-N”selfie with the rest of the members of NWA, making it the first ever time an artist in a#selfie took a ride on the “Bling Bling Bling” bus — i.e., the bus to the Billboard Music Awards.The event in question took place at a high school in East Hampton, NY.Since the #selfie trend has now become an institution, we figured it was only fair to listthe Top 20 #selfies of all time (not in any particular order). Let’s take a look ata couple more #selfies that will likely take your breath away, shall we?1. Drake’s famous selfie in the driver’s seat of a Corvette —As the first “autobiography” of Drake was made into a movie (whichwasn’t as bad as you might have thought: It received a lukewarm response, grossed morethan $300 million, and had a healthy dose of controversy, but it did well at the boxoffice nonetheless), he was interviewed by Vanity Fair about the whole thing. Duringthe interview, he got into the subject of his famous autograph, and his Corvette,with the help of a photojournalist. During the interview, Drake sat in a Corvettewith his friends in a parking lot. It’s a pretty powerful image, one that seems torepresent all that is wrong with today’s culture.2. Kanye West’s very iconic #selfie on a car while driving downNew York’s West Side Highway —It’s hard to pick a #selfie from Kanye West’s collection more iconicthan this one. The photo, titled “Can I get a black SUV??” is one of the most recognizablepictures in the world. In it, West makes	0

A suspected Nazi war criminal died in Philadelphia overnight Tuesday, just hours before a U.S. court ruling cleared the way for him to be extradited to Germany to face trial. Johann Breyer, 89, died at Thomas Jefferson University Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the medical center on West Colvin St.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ - Ã¢â‚¬Å“where [Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom] Corbett's office previously tried him on charges of conspiracy, fraud and tax evasionÃ¢â‚¬Â according to a statement by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane. The statement said Breyer died at 2 a.m. CT on Tuesday but "that has not been confirmed by the hospital or the medical examiner" because the death is still being investigated. Breyer had been held the Philadelphia County jail since October when he was arrested on a charge of burglary and theft from a residence after a raid on his home during a sweep of his rental property. He had been jailed since then on a separate charge relating to the theft of a laptop computer.Johann Breyer, 89, was convicted of war crimes, was held for nearly two years in a Philadelphia jail awaiting a judge's decision on whether he would be extradited to Germany to face trial for his part in the slaughter of nearly 700,000 people during World War II.Breyer and two other SS officers - Georg Hauser and Erhard Milch - were convicted of conspiring to murder and maim people they thought were "unreliable," the judge in court Friday said. In addition to serving in the Nazi SS, the three were charged with the murder of 50,000 Jews and other war crimes committed by the Nazi regime.

By 2050, minorities will be the majority in America, and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double, according to projections released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and migration. Minorities, classified as those of any race other than non-Hispanic, single-race whites, currently constitute about a third of the U.S. population, according to Census figures. But by 2042, they are projected to become the majority, making up more than half the population. By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities. Minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner. By 2023, the bureau said, more than half of all children will be minorities. "Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups, Hispanics in particular," said Dave Waddington, chief of the Census Bureau's population projection branch, which issued the report. "Those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age. Non-Hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older." The projections are based on Census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and net international migration, the bureau said. The group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the Hispanic population. It is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million, from 2008 through 2050, the bureau said. Its share of the total U.S. population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent. "Thus, one in three U.S. residents would be Hispanic," the Census Bureau said in a news release. The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050, going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent. The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million, or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population. Among the remaining races, the bureau said, American Indians and Alaska natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million, going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. population. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are expected to more than double, increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million.	1
Dozens of flights were canceled in and out of a northeastern Japanese city on Tuesday after construction workers came across an unexploded shell believed to be from World War II buried near a taxiway. Airport authorities in Sendai said they had canceled all 92 flights, national and international, scheduled to use the airport Tuesday after the discovery of the shell late Monday under an unpaved area beside the taxiway. Read more: World War II bomb closes part of Amsterdam airport Members of the Japanese Self Defense Force are working to remove the ordinance, which is thought to be a U.S.-made bomb dropped during World War II, the airport said, adding that officials hope flights will be able to resume Wednesday. The device still has a fuse, which raises the risk that it could explode, and is approximately 110 centimeters (43 inches) long and 35 centimeters wide, authorities said. Sendai is still recovering and rebuilding after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction across northeastern Japan in March 2011. The city is the largest in the region of Tohoku, which bore the brunt of the natural disasters. The damage to its airport was widely documented in images that emerged in the aftermath of the quake and tsunami.	1
It wasn't the screech of cannonballs, the thud of grappling hooks or the crack of muskets that most terrified the sailors of the Spanish Armada in the 16th century, but fire. The English vice-admiral Sir Francis Drake used fire ships -- aging hulks set ablaze and allowed to float freely into the Armada -- to devastating effect, forcing the Spanish ships to break formation. More than 400 years later, however, and fire is still one of the gravest threats to shipboard life. Old threat, new technology Shipboard procedures such as fire drills, on-board alarms and locking fire doors may have gone a long way to mitigating the danger of fire at sea, but the US Navy is looking at new technology to help it battle the threat. Its latest solution is to send fire-resistant metal men into the smoky, red-hot holds of its fire-stricken warships, throwing fire retarding grenades and assessing damage with a camera that can see through smoke. Called the Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot (SAFFiR), the team at the Office of Naval Research (ONR) chose a humanoid-type robot as the best way of negotiating the narrow passageways, ladders and hatches (all designed for human mobility) of a modern ship. "Every compartment and passageway on a ship is designed for human occupation and mobility," Dr Thomas McKenna, ONR program manager for human-robot interaction and cognitive neuroscience, told CNN. "There are numerous barriers, like sills, that would block a wheeled robot. In addition, a humanoid robot can use firefighting gear designed for humans, such as protective coats, backpack fire suppressants, hand-held sensors and hose nozzles," he said "The long-term goal is to keep sailors from the danger of direct exposure to fire." Shipboard fires, he said, throw up a different and more urgent set of problems than fires on land. "Shipboard fires must be suppressed, whereas in many civilian fires, a building can be considered a loss and the focus might shift to containing the fire to prevent spread," he told CNN. "On a ship, fire suppression is critical to the survival of the ship and its personnel; confined spaces, smoke, heat and gases can be a threat to humans."	1
American skating star Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a record-breaking silver medal at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver after a final-lap crash by his South Korean rivals in the 1,500 meters race, while skier  and  skated to a silver and bronze medal, respectively.The results in the 1,500 meter race were officially released on February 2, and both gold medalists and bronze medalists were officially recognized on Tuesday, February 5. The final results showed Ohno winning the silver medal in a time of three minutes and 30.06 seconds, while  finished third, followed by  in fourth and  in fifth. Anton was not only the first skier to accomplish the feat, but also the first in the history of the Olympics to win a medal in both the men’s and women’s 1,500 meter races, and the first to win a medal in the 1,500 meter race and two medals total.The raceOhno began the race with a lead of more than 20 seconds, having gone ahead of his rivals in the second segment of their run through the stadium. After briefly slowing down and then accelerating, he took a commanding lead in the process. As he crossed the finish line to receive his silver medal, he was mobbed by his teammates, who were cheering on his triumph. Ohno was wearing the same skis that he had used in his gold medal victory at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002.After the race, Ohno was quick to congratulate his Korean rivals, and remarked, "I’m always thinking about my teammates. But it was a great surprise to see them cheering for me.” The only other medal of the day, awarded to skier  for her second-place finish, was the first gold of her career.CompetitionResultsExternal links NBC Olympics Coverage – 1,500 meter raceBobsleighCategory:Bobsleigh at the Winter OlympicsCategory:Men's sports competitions in CanadaCategory:Bobsleigh in the United StatesCategory:20th century in VancouverCategory:Winter sports in CanadaBobsleighCategory:International sports competitions hosted by VancouverBobsleigh	0
London's Heathrow Airport is "fully operational" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway. British Â© 2016 Bloomberg via Getty ImagesLondon's Heathrow Airport is "fully operational" and returning to normal after an emergency landing forced the closing of both runways, the airport said Friday morning.At the time, the airport was shut down for a total of six hours after a Boeing 747-400 bound for London from the United Arab Emirates landed safely and suddenly lost power while taxiing, causing the plane to fall off the runway. Heathrow had to use its backup tower in London to re-acquire the aircraft by following a manual procedure. Some passengers had to wait in immigration lines at Heathrow Airport to check-in for their flights.As of early Friday morning, the airport was operational. Passengers are scheduled to be off the ground for the afternoon.British Airways said it hopes to have a full schedule on British Airways flights by the end of the day.The airport said Friday it plans to give passengers with flights affected by the issue "information about alternate departure options" by the end of the day.But there was no word on whether any passengers' other flights would be affected.The airport was closed for a total of six hours after the Boeing 747-400 came down the runway. This was nearly four hours later than originally planned.A spokesman for Heathrow said a technical team with British Airways is working on the airline's operations at the airport. He didn't say when services would be re-opened, but said Heathrow will remain open.Passengers were sent home as a short-term measure.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was checking the incident and looking into how other airlines handle emergency landings around airports.There is a general aviation emergency landing procedure for an aircraft coming down the runway. The flight crew would then have to decide whether to divert to a nearby airport. If they decide to divert, they would have to make a series of decisions to get the plane back to the airport. The process would be followed by air traffic controllers.Airlines in the United States, including United, JetBlue and Delta Air Lines, have a general aviation emergency landing procedure similar to that of the pilots' emergency landing	0
Kurt Haskell's eyes were locked on the seatback monitor in front of him when the words of a passing flight attendant caught his attention. "She said something smells like smoke," recalled Haskell, a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253. "I got out of my seat and took a few steps up the aisle, and that's when Row 19 burst into flames." Two passengers quickly hauled the man sitting in the burning row into the first-class section. A flight attendant grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the flames in what became the latest example of citizens taking action when counterterrorism safeguards fall short. At the time, Haskell said he didn't know if he was witnessing a terrorist attack or a freak accident. In the hours ahead, he and the other passengers learned the details of the near-tragedy. The suspect, later identified as Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, allegedly tried to bring down the airliner with explosives concealed in his underwear. Despite warnings that he allegedly was consorting with Islamist extremists and that he was listed in a database of suspicious people, the 23-year-old Nigerian was allowed to board the plane. "We dodged a bullet but just barely," President Obama said last week. A disaster was averted by "brave individuals -- not because the system worked," he said. Brave individuals also were credited for saving the 197 people on American Airlines Flight 63 in December 2001. Passengers and crew saw Richard Reid trying to ignite a bomb in his shoe. The bomb malfunctioned, and those onboard subdued him and tied him to his seat. Three months before, on September 11, passengers overtook hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, foiling an apparent attempt to crash the plane into a Washington target. The plane instead crashed in a Pennsylvania field, killing everyone aboard. In situations such as these, everyday people play "the most vital role" in the nation's fight against terrorism, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. "Citizens have a role and they have a responsibility, but it's the last and it's the thinnest line of defense," Hoffman said. On the front end, the counterterrorism system couldn't function without help from the public, Hoffman said, pointing to the United Kingdom's campaign against the Irish Republican Army and Israel's against the second Intifada.	1

Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential "American Bandstand," has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said. He was 82. Clark suffered a heart attack while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an examination after experiencing what Shefrin characterized as a mild heart attack. Clark died Friday at his home in Bel Air, Calif., Shefrin said. Clark's band, the Top Notes, was scheduled to embark on a tour Monday in support of his latest album, "Strawberry Wine," with Clark and his wife, Ruth. Billboard first reported the news.Published: February 27, 2015VATICAN CITY (CNS) The world may never have seen a pope more "in touch" with reality than Pope Francis, who is being hailed as a "brilliant" media pioneer, a "tireless" reformer and the world's first Jesuit "media pope," The Boston Globe reported.The pontiff appeared on Boston's "Today" show to discuss modern media issues Tuesday and on Wednesday on CBS' "Face the Nation" to discuss recent developments in the country.During remarks at the Vatican, Francis said that "a certain kind of journalism" was always needed."The journalists, they just can't keep up with the new technologies. They need to get trained, and that's a task for which you need to find a little room and you need to be able to open this window of communication, and you need to be able to hear what the people are saying," he said.The pope said that journalists were needed to ask the difficult questions of the president and to "make sure that you are not talking to those who are not ready to change their way of doing business."When the pope's conversation with CBS' Bob Schieffer was discussed on Wednesday, he said, "I do not wish to tell other people how to write. That's my job. But, for journalists who really want, who really want to understand what is happening to our societies in the world, it is absolutely necessary. It's absolutely necessary to write the truth, but it is also necessary to write a story and to write the truth in the way that you want to, because you can't write what you want to read."Francis said that the media "shouldn't be talking exclusively to those who already agree with them,	0
Il Rottomatore -- or "the demolition man" -- is how Italy's incoming prime minister has come to be known, thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics. Matteo Renzi's nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up support in one of the most fractious governing systems on the planet, one which has speared all but one of its governments since World War II. Then again, the 39-year-old's backers say this football-fan Mayor of Florence is precisely the breath of fresh air needed in Rome's stuffy halls of power. Neither an MP nor an elected premier, Renzi has managed to wrest control of the party's leadership by promising to smash the gridlocked reform process and shift its axis to the center. How he thinks he will manage to garner more support than career politicians, like his predecessor Enrico Letta, is as yet unclear. What's more: Renzi had initially vowed only to seek the top job through the ballot box and not a leadership contest, meaning some are skeptical about what he stands for. ''What Renzi's done is gutsy,'' says Giuseppe Ragusa of the Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. ''But he is not going to have the public's support; he doesn't have the votes from the electoral poll. So this is going to be a difficulty. Instead Ragusa says Italy is hoping that by virtue of his youth and dynamism Renzi will have the energy ''to do something very quickly." Something, being the optimal word. Italy has been crying out for a plausible, long-term economic agenda for years, leaving the country wholly unprepared for the economic slump of recent years. Often described as his country's answer to Tony Blair, Renzi is good at talking the big picture, which is probably just as well because Italy's problems aren't small. First there's a two trillion-euro debt pile to shrink, record unemployment, crippling and antiquated labor laws not to mention stifling business and payroll taxes. Still, top of the list for Renzi, will be moves to create the kind of political stability where such measures can actually take hold. This means ploughing on with plans to reform the parliamentary system in a move which is likely to cost the country its upper house -- or senate -- in its current form.	1
Former Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska has been "cleared" by the Justice Department's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him, his lawyer said Wednesday. Former Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (AP)U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. (Photo: AP)U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday he had agreed to a plea bargain that would give him an opportunity to avoid jail time for his role in the so-called Fast and Furious operation.U.S. District Judge Denise Casper issued a tentative ruling that could lead to Holder’s early release, but the Justice Department told Casper it could not proceed with the agreement until he would step aside for his own safety. Holder submitted his resignation on Feb. 18.The Justice Department said the deal, which would reduce Holder’s sentence, would be subject to change based on changes to the proposed deal.Under the deal, Holder will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice for his handling of the secret operation that was exposed by the news media. At his sentencing on Friday, the judge will sentence the former attorney general to seven months in prison, though he could be as early as Tuesday.As part of the deal, Holder will admit responsibility for "willfully" misleading the Congress on the operation in a document obtained by the Associated Press last year. The plea agreement does not require him to admit guilt.Holder’s lawyers have indicated the former attorney general could be convicted at a jury trial. Under the agreement, he will still be eligible to receive up to six months in prison for the felony charge he faces from the Justice Department for concealing documents subpoenaed by the Senate Finance Committee during its investigation of the Fast and Furious arms-running program.Holder will also be required to pay $600,000 to former Arizona U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, who brought charges against him, and $5,000 to other defendants who agreed to cooperate with federal investigators, but who did not testify against Holder.Holder’s lawyers will get credit for any jail time he has already served, but they will request a sentence as low as six months to begin his six-month probation. Under the plea agreement, the sentence can be much higher.In court documents, Holder said he did not	0
From the custom-made, hand-beaded white dress to silver-studded high-heeled shoes, diamond jewelry and tiara, Jenny Ferro is preparing for a day she's dreamed about since she was 3 years old. "I'm really excited," says Jenny, eagerly nodding her head. "Really, really, a lot!" She isn't getting married. The 15-year-old is preparing for her quinceañera, a coming-of-age ritual in Latin culture, marking a young girl's entrance into womanhood. The centuries-old tradition began as a ceremony to introduce girls to society on their 15th birthday and signified that they were ready for marriage. Today, many quinceañeras have become much more elaborate. Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music. The theme of the party is bedazzled. First, there is the dress, which Marlene had designed specially for her daughter. It cost about $800. Then there are the shoes, high-heeled and silver to match the dress. During the party, the high heels will be ceremoniously slipped onto her feet to replace her flat shoes -- a symbolic transition of her journey from childhood to womanhood. "It makes her look like a princess," gushes Marlene Ferro. Quinceañeras are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of "Quinceañera!" a comprehensive guide to the celebration. "The 15th birthday, culturally, is a milestone. It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special," Salcedo says. Experts believe the quinceañera is rooted in Mayan, Aztec and European traditions. Today, many coming-of-age ceremonies resemble lavish "Sweet 16" celebrations. Beyond the elaborate apparel, food and festivities, modern quinceañeras often feature a court of 15 people, typically consisting of family and friends. As the event continues to grow in popularity, the makeup of the court has also changed.	1
Much advice for fathers is written about reluctant dads. But, of course, this is not all of us. Before I became a father, I struggled to find advice that really spoke to me, and I hope that the  following pages will offer some of the best.1. Don't get attached to your kid. The first step is having a relationship, however tenuous, with your soon-to-be young man. I was the kid in grade school who was teased by a classmate: "Hey, don't you know your brother? He's a girl-child!"I had no idea that was how I looked, and, because I didn't see myself as a boy, I assumed I would remain a boy forever. I found myself being taught for years, by my parents, to live and love in and around boys, instead of girls (the world at that time had no transgender policies, and boys were taught to be "tough" and "masculine," while girls were taught to be "weak and feminine").I don't regret any of these lessons, but what did stay with me is my dad's response to my friend's criticism. He said, "No one's life is defined by their gender. Gender, no matter how you define it, is not an identity. Do not try to live your life based on gender. Do not try to feel a male or female or whatever kind of emotional connection you feel when a boy or a girl is around you. It just doesn't work that way."That is all I wanted to hear from him. I didn't want to be defined by gender. I didn't want to feel boys and girls tugging at me. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be me.2. Don't live as if only one of you is a father. It took me a long time to understand that my dad had a strong-willed wife—who was only a little older than me, and who would often say, "You're not a man." And sometimes he gave me advice that would make adults I loved ask, "Why do you need to take on so much responsibility while your mother will always be there?"In the meantime, I was going through menopause, and I was confused and miserable. I didn't understand the need to be a dad. I'd had a few boyfriends in high school and college,	0
It remains advantage Los Rojiblancos in the race for the La Liga title as Atletico Madrid battled to a 1-0 away win at Valencia to lead by four points by the end of Sunday's program. Barcelona moved up to second with a 3-2 win at Villarreal in the late match, their first since the death of former coach Tito Vilanova this week. Barca trailed to a Ruben Cani goal just before halftime and fell further behind when Manuel Trigueros scored for the home side on 55 minutes. But a pair of Villarreal own goals from Gabriel Paulista and Mateo Musacchio allowed the Catalan giants to level before Lionel Messi grabbed the winner seven minutes from time. Real Madrid, who beat Osasuna 4-0 Saturday, are six points adrift but have a game in hand on both their rival. But Atletico will clinch La Liga for the first time in 18 years with two wins from their remaining three game, the last of which is against Barcelona Atletico were able to register a ninth straight win in their relentless march to the title with a goal from Raul Garcia just before halftime proving the difference in the Mestella. "We wanted to win for us and for all the people who've come to Valencia. Their support is essential" #AupaAtleti, the scorer tweeted after the match. Both teams are involved in European competition next week, with Atletico fielding a strong team despite a Champions League semifinal second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday. Valencia, who are looking to overhaul a 2-0 deficit to Sevilla at the same stage of the Europa League, were also nearly at full strength and made a bright start against the league leaders. Atletico's David Villa came close to scoring against his old club before the visitors made the breakthrough as Gabi picked out Garcia who scored with a deft header. Atletico's leading scorer Diego Costa had two good chances to make the game safe for Diego Simeone's men in the second half but they held out for a vital three points although losing Juanfran to a red card in stoppage time. Meanwhile in France's Ligue 1, defending champions Paris St Germain missed the chance to wrap up a second successive title. The were held to a 1-1 draw by at struggling Sochaux to go eight points clear of Monaco with three games remaining.	1
College football's top-ranked LSU Tigers defeated the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide 9-6 in overtime Saturday night. LSU won the coin toss in overtime, electing to start on defense. The ides of the two teams traded touchdowns in the first half as they began to trade field goals. LSU took control of the game in the second half, outscoring Alabama 42-9, thanks to a pair of blocked field goal attempts by LSU's Calvin Throckmorton. LSU was able to put the game away with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Anthony Jennings to Marcell Ateman with 1:56 left in overtime. With the win, LSU improves to 21-1 overall, and gets to face No. 1 Ohio State in the first round of the College Football Playoff.Alabama ended LSU's perfect start with a second half comeback. After Alabama took the lead with a 42-yard field goal, LSU made their biggest play of the game to end the scoring streak. Throckmorton blocked a field goal attempt by Alabama in the second quarter, giving the Tigers the ball on their own 41-yard line. Throckmorton then ran for a touchdown pass, which brought the Tigers within three points of Alabama. Alabama was able to take a 10-7 lead on a pair of field goals by kicker Daniel Carlson. Alabama then drove downfield and converted a pair of 4th-and-14 conversions to close the game out.LSU QB Anthony Jennings threw for a franchise record 456 yards and three touchdowns. His 1,743 yards passing in 2017 broke the previous record held by his predecessor, JaMarcus Russell. Jennings threw an interception in the third quarter which helped give the Crimson Tide an early lead. LSU then converted a pair of 4th-and-13 conversions to take control of the game and go on to win the game.Quarterback Anthony Jennings completed 31-of-41 attempts for 429 yards and three touchdowns on the night. Running back Corey Lemonier also ran for four scores, bringing his total to six rushing scores to go along with two touchdowns. Sophomore tight end C.J.

After President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, a group organizing a fundraiser on his behalf suddenly had to find a bigger venue. The event, featuring the pop singer Pink, is one of two LGBT-organized fundraisers Obama is expected to attend on the West Coast on Wednesday. A CNN analysis of President Obama's biggest fundraisers, known as bundlers, shows that at least 33 -- or about one in every 16 bundlers -- is openly gay. Together, they have raised at least $8 million for the campaign between January and the end of March. CNN poll: Majority of Americans say they have gay friends, family members By contrast, in the same period, bundlers from the television, movie and music industry, some of whom attended a recent high-profile fundraiser hosted by actor George Clooney, raised $6.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Interactive: Celebrities back candidates for president While campaign finance laws require donors to disclose their full names, addresses, occupations and employers, there is no box to check for sexual orientation. Nor does the law require candidates to release information about their bundlers. Under prodding from watchdog groups, presidential campaigns have released bundler data in past elections. Obama's campaign has released its list. Republican candidate Mitt Romney's campaign has not. In CNN's analysis, only bundlers who have disclosed their orientation in past CNN reporting or in trusted LGBT publications were counted as gay. The Washington Post has reported that as many as one in six bundlers supporting Obama are gay. The Advocate Magazine estimates one in five. Glancing down the names on the bundlers list released by the Obama campaign for the first quarter, it is easy to find people known for their work on behalf of the LGBT community. Tim Gill, a software entrepreneur who runs a large Colorado-based foundation that backs gay rights projects, has already contributed $672,800 with his partner Scott Miller to the Obama for America campaign. Fred Eychaner, who owns the Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., has donated $1,220,550 so far.	1
Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday. Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor. A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith. On Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment. Both indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), committed the offenses "as an accomplice." According to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison. "The cases involve two separate victims," Smith said in the statement. "Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved." Jeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin. The trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to "recent information in the case," but he did not elaborate. The judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection. Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape. During his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.	1
The British Wildlife Photography Awards 2013 are celebrating the beauty of Great Britain's nature. A photo of a dolphin surfing in the waves off Northern Ireland is this year's overall winner. Titled "In the Living Room," it was taken by photographer George Karbus, a Czech photographer who is based in Ireland. Karbus was diving with his camera off the coast in Northern Ireland when he spotted a bottlenose dolphin. "I've had quite a few encounters with dolphins there before but that day I was just looking to capture some underwater rolling barrel shots when I got a present of this incredibly playful dolphin, which joined me for some underwater body surfing for a few waves and then left," he said of the winning picture. "My favorite place on Earth is Ireland," he said. "After nine years of living here I still get amazed by its coastal beauty and everything it has to offer." Other pictures include owl chicks peeking out of a tree hole, tiny fungi in front of massive trees, eerie underwater world inhabitants, and a deer in a housing estate. The photographs are exhibited at The Mall Galleries in London until September 7. A book featuring all images from the awards will be published later in September. The British Wildlife Photography Awards were established four years ago to recognize the talents of wildlife photographers working in Britain and raise awareness for the country's biodiversity and habitats.	1
Jesse James' Nazi hat was a gift from a Jewish mentor and does not make him a neo-Nazi, his lawyer said Wednesday. James is at a treatment facility "to deal with personal issues" in a bid to save his marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, a spokeswoman for James said. "He realized that this time was crucial to help himself, help his family and help save his marriage," she said. A photo recently surfaced of James wearing the German Nazi hat as he raised his right arm in a salute. The hat may have been in poor taste, but it was given to James as a gag gift by his Jewish godfather, attorney Joe Yanny said. Possessing Nazi memorabilia does not make someone a neo-Nazi, he said. As evidence that James is no anti-Semite, Yanny said James lived for nearly a month in an Israeli kibbutz. His lawyer would not disclose what kind of treatment the famous motorcycle designer is seeking. "I would request that his rights in regards to privacy and his medical matters be respected," said Yanny. James has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month. Yanny refused to talk about the condition of the James-Bullock marriage, which came under question when several women went public with claims they were involved with him. "I understand people's desire in newsworthy stories, but I would hope that by now this wasn't such a newsworthy story such that his basic rights and privacy aren't continuously invaded in an improper manner," Yanny told CNN. He said "99 percent" of what has published about James in recent weeks is untrue. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.	1
It should have been a great morning for Richie Incognito. A brand new black Ferrari was delivered to his Florida house on Tuesday. Instead he is at the center of national media attention and exiled from his NFL team after a vernacular altercation with a teammate.He was in Italy with his family, including his infant daughter, when a video showed him slapping a man who was challenging his girlfriend to a touch football game in the parking lot of his suburban Miami apartment complex.In the video, Incognito is seen yelling at the man and grabbing his groin when other people walk into the frame. Incognito was suspended by the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL on Thursday for his actions, which were captured in a series of still photos and cellphone videos that circulated on social media. Incognito refused to address the incident at his news conference with team officials.“These are the actions of a young man who is growing up, trying to figure out who he is,” Ravens assistant general manager Eric DeCosta said. “This is not the Richie Incognito we’ve been working with for the last few years.”For the record, Incognito declined to comment for this story. Ravens coach John Harbaugh and team officials issued the following statement:“We’ve had a great amount of contact with Richie and his family over the last five days. We’ve watched him grow up this last offseason, and we have great respect for him. While this will undoubtedly be a point of contention between him and the Ravens, we wish Richie and his family nothing but the best.”Incognito was ordered off the field Tuesday night before Baltimore’s 22-19 win over Tampa Bay.Incognito had a rough start to his career with the Ravens, a month after his release by the New England Patriots. He was the most disruptive player on the New England roster in the locker room and in the training room.

The thing about North Korea is that once in a while, it does something that sends the international community into a flurry of talk about the hermit nation, even though little is known about what's really going on. This week, Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan, in what the U.S. and Japan now claim is an unprovoked hostile act.While we have yet to receive official confirmation from Tokyo, the news that a North Korean missile fired last week crossed the nation's northern border certainly leaves no doubt of its intention. And, like the previous missile launches, the launch in this case appears to have been a propaganda-stunt of the highest order.The missile, North Korea's first since 2010, is reported to be carrying multiple warheads and is capable of reaching a wide range of areas.In this case, it would likely have been fired after U.S. President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss North Korea and the ongoing peace talks with the country's leaders. With the missile test occurring mere hours after this meeting, North Korea appears to have tried to bolster Mr. Trump's public image by sending a public message to foreign leaders, presumably for the purpose of showing them that they have an ally in Mr. Trump.There is some speculation that the missile's path could also be part of the game plan for the president as his administration is negotiating with North Korea. Some have speculated that there are parts of the talks being structured in such a way that North Korea might launch a missile in order to prove that it can be successfully tested. This kind of rhetoric, even about potential U.S. missiles coming towards North Korea, is something one really has to be careful about.While this particular missile test is more dangerous in its potential to start a war and bring a nuclear disaster on the Korean peninsula, the danger that a test could have posed in this case is that it might have given new impetus to the idea that the country might no longer be a one-China, one-language, one-religion nation in which North Korea is treated "like a pariah."North Korea has been a communist nation since its beginning in 1948, and the current government has a long history of trying to undermine the U.S. and South Korea by supporting violent organizations and by trying to have "all-China" elections when North Korean representatives are allowed to run in those elections.The	0
He suffered greatly in his final months, but Nelson Mandela's last breaths were peaceful, says his eldest daughter, Maki Mandela. She describes the end as a "beautiful passing on" but says his death and burial came as a relief to her after his long health struggles. "There were times I was telling the doctors I think enough is enough," Maki Mandela says in an exclusive interview with CNN from her home in Johannesburg. "As doctors they had their duty to try everything up to the last moment, but for me as a daughter it was excruciating watching that." The former South African President, who led his country out of decades of apartheid after being imprisoned 27 years, died in December at age 95. For a year before his death, her father was on dialysis for kidney failure and a ventilator to help him breathe. He was fed intravenously through tubes into his stomach, and his arms and hands grew swollen due to the intravenous antibiotics and other medications he was receiving. Bedridden and incontinent, the Nobel Peace Prize winner had no quality of life, his daughter says. Recently writing in favor of assisted dying, former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu questioned the treatment of Nelson Mandela in his final months, saying it was "disgraceful." In an editorial for Britain's The Observer, Tutu singled out South African President Jacob Zuma and other politicians who took photos with a clearly confused and ill Mandela and called it an "affront to his dignity." Maki Mandela says she constantly questioned her father's team of state medical doctors about why his life was being prolonged. "I said, 'Guys, when do we accept that we have reached the end and we can't play God?' " But she says she accepted the doctors' decisions and knows they were bound to "try everything." She says she couldn't fault the care and dedication of the team of medics and nurses who looked after her father 24 hours a day. "They treated him with dignity and respect," she says. Throughout his long illness, his heart remained strong, perhaps not surprising for a man who dedicated his life to the struggle against apartheid and helped to lead his nation to democracy. "When the heart started giving, it was a matter of days," Maki Mandela says. The anti-apartheid icon was buried on his farm in Qunu, a remote rural area in the Eastern Cape where he grew up.	1
Doctors distributed antibiotics to passengers aboard an Italian cruise ship after four crew members were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, Italy's health ministry reported Monday. All four were taken to hospitals in the Italian port of Livorno after the crew of the MSC Orchestra reported the illnesses, the ministry said. More than 2,800 doses of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were issued for passengers, and the ministry said passengers who have disembarked in the past week should take similar precautions. The 294-meter (965-foot), 2,500-passenger Orchestra is currently in the French port of Villefranche sur Mer, on the outskirts of Nice, and the ministry said Italian authorities have notified their French counterparts. MSC, the passenger arm of Italy's Mediterranean Shipping Company, said it was doing "everything necessary to safeguard the health of its guests and all the crew members." Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered The crew members were diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, which attacks the lining of the brain and the spinal cord. The disease is passed by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. "The strand was found in the crew that worked in the kitchen and that, therefore, they should not have had continuous and close contact with passengers," the Health Ministry noted. Two of the four cases were identified as Meningitis C. The cases involve a different disease than the outbreak of fungal meningitis now being seen in the United States. Eight people have died after being injected with steroids contaminated by a fungus, the CDC reported Monday. CNN Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.	1
with commitment and professionalism. She had gone there to have tea with the ambassador, a respected television journalist set to renew acquaintances with a diplomat and do her job. Then came the blast. Whether or not they'd crossed paths before, these two people's stories now forever will be intertwined -- thanks to a man Turkish authorities say belonged to the Marxist Leninist organization known as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, which the U.S. government and others label a terrorist organization. What is the DHKP-C? Ecevit Sanli, as he was identified by Istanbul police, died after detonating his bomb near the embassy's Gate No. 2 around 1:15 p.m. (6:15 a.m. ET) Friday. So, too, did the Turkish guard -- described by U.S. Ambassador Francis Ricciardone as a "hero," and identified by Turkey's semi-official Anadolu News Agency as Mustafa Akarsu. A photo showed the journalist being carried away on a stretcher, apparently bleeding. Rather than sitting with her for tea, Ricciardone visited the woman -- Didem Tuncay -- at Ankara's Numune Hospital, and afterward described her as "one of the best." While theories have been floated,  neither Turkish nor U.S. authorities have detailed why they think Sanli blew himself up. Prior to Friday, he was known to U.S. and other intelligence agencies, a U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. Whatever Sanli's rationale, the explosion spurred security clampdowns at diplomatic facilities in Turkey, plus messages of condolences and solidarity. Turkish Prime Minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan called it an attack "against the peace and welfare of our country." Yet the violence reverberated well beyond Turkey's borders, however, especially in the nation whose embassy was targeted. The spotlight on U.S. diplomatic installations was already intense after violence last September in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was one of four Americans killed in Benghazi. U.S. Rep. Ed Royce said Friday's explosion in Turkey served as "yet another stark reminder of the constant terrorist threat against U.S. facilities, personnel and interests aboard." "Coming after Benghazi, it underscores the need for a comprehensive review of security at our diplomatic posts," said Royce, a California Republican and chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee.	1
Unmanned aircraft, for all their utility, are fairly simple beasts. They're good at taking direction, but they're not so good at processing information on their own. Now the Air Force figures it's time for drones to get a lot smarter, especially as they take off or land. As anyone who's ever flown knows, the runway is a crowded place. Planes on the runway queue up to get airborne. Planes in the air have to coordinate with Air Traffic Control for the order in which they can safely land, taking precautions not to get in anyone's way until it's their turn. There's a fair amount of information to rapidly process in order to avoid collisions and other accidents. Pilots can handle that information load. Drones can't. Yet. It's one of the big reasons why the Federal Aviation Administration has been so reluctant to allow unmanned aircraft to fly over the U.S. Even robotic flights over relatively unpopulated areas along the southern border have been canceled when there's the most routine technical hiccups. On Tuesday, the Air Force Research Laboratory at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said it'll soon solicit engineers to design an algorithm to allow drones to "integrate seamlessly" with piloted planes for takeoff and landing. In the algorithm-driven future that the labs want to build, drones will be equipped a database of terminal procedures; link up with Air Traffic Control; and "recognize the intent of other aircraft." For instance: aircraft landing on parallel runways can appear to be on a collision course before they turn and land. Right now, a drone would simply perceive that a plane's trajectory is going to remain unchanged, making it a threat for collision. But a capable algorithm would let the drone process Air Traffic Control information like basic airfield maps to know that there's no actual danger from the oncoming piloted plane. "The developed algorithm(s), optimally, would require no more a priori information than a human pilot," the labs instruct. "Intent analysis should be accurate, reliable and real-time, enabling quick and appropriate decisions that are necessary in this time critical environment." There's a clear commercial application here. As Wired mentioned on Wednesday, FedEx is starting to think about an airfleet of linked-up drones that can fly in formation at the direction of a piloted aircraft. Building algorithms that can let drones process complex information in congested airspace sounds like a useful step toward that futuristic cargo fleet.	1
It's a horror show that has played out across Syria for 19 months. Those grieving the dead are themselves targeted by gunfire or deadly blasts. That cycle of death played out again Tuesday when mourners gathered to grieve a man who dared speak out against the Syrian government. A car bomb silenced them. "Children's bodies were maimed and burnt. I saw pieces of human flesh and blood on the street," witness Ahmed Al-Muadami said. This day, mourners came to honor one of 14 men who died after his arrest by Air Force Intelligence -- a much feared security apparatus that dissidents accuse of hunting down anti-government activists. Word spread quickly Tuesday that a Damascus hospital had a collection of unidentified bodies. The families of the 14 men rushed to the scene -- only to discover the bodies of their loved ones bore signs of torture. The outrage boiled over in the Damascus suburb of Muadamiyet al-Sham, where a funeral procession for one of the men morphed into a protest against President Bashar al-Assad's government. Then came the explosion near the Al-Zaitoona mosque, which is a popular gathering site for anti-government protests. "It was a car bomb parked next to the mosque where the people were gathered. The explosion killed at least 13 people and wounded over a hundred," Al-Muadami said. "One child was extremely disfigured ... we couldn't identify him." Amateur videos reportedly from the scene show a grisly aftermath. One man carried the lifeless body of a child, his face charred black and gray. "Look at this, Assad!" the man screamed. "Is this your gift to us for the Eid? Look at this, you murderer!" The Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha begins Friday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos or reports of violence, as the Syrian government has restricted access to international journalists. The Damascus suburbs have seen fierce fighting for months. Opposition activists say the government has committed massacres, while the government says it is fighting armed terrorists. International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is trying to broker a cease-fire by Friday. But the odds seem daunting. On Tuesday alone, at least 100 people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs; 50 were from Muadamiyet al-Sham, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The activist network said residents in the town called for blood donors after the explosion.	1
A former Guantanamo Bay detainee from Britain is among four people arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terrorism offenses, UK counterterror Two British men and two French nationals have been arrested in France on suspicion of Syria-related offenses.The men are being held in Paris over alleged "terrorist" connections.The arrests come one year after two Britons were arrested on similar charges after returning home and attempting to travel to Syria.One, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is a top al-Qaida operative now on trial at the Guantanamo Bay prison and the other, Mohammed el-Beltagi, was a top aide to Osama bin Laden's successor as al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.The four men have been taken into custody in Paris over "terrorist" connections or "probable terrorist" connections.A British government spokesman said the men would be questioned about terror-related charges before being handed over to French authorities to be charged."We are considering the investigation very seriously and supporting the relevant authorities wherever possible," he said.The men are believed to be part of a French terror cell that was arrested on Nov. 1, two years after two young men from Britain who had travelled to Syria for jihad went missing.French counter terrorism officials said they believe the four were involved in a plot to kill the US ambassador in France.A former Guantanamo Bay inmate who has already been released was also arrested by French police on New Year's Eve in connection to that killing, sources said.France on Tuesday said police arrested a man in Paris who has links to a terror group linked to the recent murder of rapper, film director and activist Geert Wilders.A Belgian man named as Walid Ebu Abdulla, who is on the EU's terror watch list, was arrested.Mr Abdulla had been in Syria since November of last year and was allegedly in contact with Mr Wilders.In addition to Mr Abdulla, the police also arrested a 35-year-old man in Belgium.Police detained another Belgian man named as Brahim Beydoun, who prosecutors said was suspected of being involved in the plot.A British government spokesman said police were conducting an investigation into the arrests and would be liaising with the French authorities.French counter-terror police detained a Belgian man on New Year's Day after	0
I'm a big history buff," President Obama said in an interview with ABC News" George Stephanopoulos. "And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of." I am sometimes asked the same question that Mr. Stephanopoulos put to President Obama: Why study Confederate history? And I agree with the president's response. As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, we look back to its centennial in the 1960s. A lot has happened in this country since then, and our appreciation of the lessons of history has changed with the times. One constant has been the importance of the Civil War. It remains as the most important era of American history, a time when America withstood its biggest challenges to a constitutional democracy which then was still viewed as an experiment in a new form of government. The crucible of war defined the nation as we know it today, as we became "indivisible" and "with liberty and justice for all" for the first time. During the 1960s, we Americans looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields, because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day. And the Confederate soldiers have historically captured our fascination even more than the Union soldiers. Perhaps it is the gallantry and dash of leaders like Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson or J.E.B. Stuart. Or perhaps it was the common enlisted men in the Confederate ranks, whose valor and courage -- in the face of tremendous privation and against overwhelming odds -- makes them stand out in world history as one of the best bodies of soldiers ever known. Another perspective on the Confederacy and history If the fascination with soldiers continues from the 1960s to today, what has changed? Today, the study of Confederate history is much more "inclusive" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past. Today we ask different questions of history and I think we get better answers. Let me list just a few of those questions.	1
R. Sargent Shriver, who was responsible for launching the U.S. Peace Corps after marrying into the Kennedy family and joining John F. Kennedy's White House, has died, according to his family. Shriver, whose full name was Robert  Shriver, was 94. He died Friday in a nursing home in Washington, said his son David. President Barack Obama spoke at Shriver's funeral Saturday, said spokesman Robert Gibbs. "He was a giant in American society who helped bring about some of the changes that we're now seeing in American foreign policy with his efforts that shaped the Peace Corps," Gibbs said. "He helped inspire the Peace Corps by his leadership and his example."A native of New York City, Shriver was raised in a prominent New York social and business elite. He attended Columbia University in the 1930s, where he earned a degree in history in 1938, according to a biography by his son. After a stint in the U. S. Army, he joined the New York publishing company Houghton Mifflin and later the family-owned New York Herald Tribune. Shriver was the first editor of the Sunday Herald Tribune when in 1956 he broke the story on CIA involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion. In 1960, he was recruited by William J. Casey to join the Justice Department in forming the Peace Corps.Shriver moved to Washington in 1958, where he worked for the Kennedy administration, eventually serving as consul in Rio de Janiero and then as assistant president for intergovernmental affairs in 1963. President Kennedy appointed Shriver to the U.S. Senate in 1965 and he won a seat as vice president in 1968. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Kennedy entrusted the nomination of George H.W. Bush to succeed him with Shriver in his Senate office, though Bush withdrew when he became vice president. Bush nominated Shriver to be U.S. secretary of agriculture, a post he held from 1969 to 1973. He joined the Peace Corps in May 1972 and was stationed in Kenya when a peace agreement was signed with the Mau Mau rebels, the United Nations adopted the Declaration to End the War of Independence and a draft constitution was passed.When it was announced that Shriver, a Republican, would become the first director of the Peace Corps in 1969, he said in a letter to Bush, "I know you've been looking for another experienced administrator for the Peace Corps.

Two light rail transit cars collided Saturday in San Francisco, causing multiple injuries, but none appeared life-threatening, a rail system spokesman said.  The collision occurred at 3:43 p.m. on the Embarcadero at the foot of Market Street, a spokesman said. The cars collided head-on, sending one of them off the tracks, he said.  "No injuries were reported," the spokesman said. Crews spent some time detouring the stalled cars to enable service to resume, he said.  There was nothing to indicate the two cars were headed to the same destination, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said. One of them arrived at the end of the line, he said.  The collision occurred on a bridge over the bay, but there was no evidence that a bridge was involved, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Fire Department said.  The trains were operated by San Francisco Municipal Railway, which is headquartered in San Francisco.  The agency has taken over operations from the California Department of Transportation, which operates the Bay Area Rapid Transit line.  This is the second crash in a month involving light rail vehicles in San Francisco. A car carrying a San Francisco mayoral candidate was hit by light rail vehicle in January.  In a report released Thursday, the Federal Transit Administration said all of the agency's public light rail vehicles are properly maintained and are in proper operating condition.  The report's findings were based on a survey of agency employees. It covered the period from January to May 2007.-- Mark Strobel in the News(c)2001 San Francisco ChronicleAll HeadlinesChapin, L. - It was a little after 5 p.m. on a warm Saturday, and there was a strong light in the sky. It had been raining heavily during the afternoon, leading to a thunderstorm and a dangerous slick of water that covered the streets with a thick, yellowish-green sludge.It was not the kind of storm that usually brings out the neighborhood grinch.Instead, it was just another Saturday night at the neighborhood bar, with most of the patrons gathered in the beer garden, enjoying a cold draft of beer as their evening was brought to a close with the closing of the bar.But there would be more than a few left in there that night.

President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the controversial low-altitude flyover of New York by a 747 plane used as Air Force One, the White House said Friday. The 747 used as Air Force One flies over the Statue of Liberty in this photo released by the White House. The photo shoot, which President Obama said he was "furious" with, happened on April 27. The image of a low-flying plane accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city. Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey. Read more of Obama's reaction Caldera later apologized for the flyover. "I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office," Caldera said in a letter to Obama. "Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office." The White House also released a photo of the flyover and a report on the incident on Friday. In the report, the White House said Caldera, who had been traveling with President Obama when the flyover plans were initially discussed, did not remember a conversation in which his deputy, George Mulligan, informed him of the flyover. Caldera did not open an e-mail about final plans for the flyover until after it had happened, the report said, noting Caldera had been suffering from severe muscle spasms and had left the office early on several days. Although recommendations by several parties involved in the flyover had been made that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina be informed of the plans, the report said, that job was left to Caldera, who did not pass the information along. The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot. Military officials estimate the mission and the photo shoot, aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $328,835 in taxpayer money.	1
Russian authorities on Friday seized radioactive material from the luggage of a passenger on a flight from Moscow to Tehran, Iran. The luggage, belonging to an Iranian citizen, contained 18 metal objects packed  with highly radioactive material and three vials of a substance with similar characteristics.The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency on the flight that arrived in Tehran from Moscow said that on board was a man with two small children. The family were detained as they were about to disembark.The objects were brought to the airport under “security conditions,” the agency said.The seized objects had been packed in plastic bags, and contained radioactive substances. The objects were taken to a government radiation laboratory where they will undergo analysis.The objects are the same as those that the United States said were part of an Iranian nuclear research site. The materials were stolen in a July 4, 2007 robbery of a nuclear fuel storage facility in the city of Natanz, in Iran, the State Department said in a 2007 press release. The facility, which was part of Kharazmi National Reactor, was destroyed in a January 2008 fire, which Iran denied taking part in. However, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in a report that there was a “high degree of confidence” that the stolen material was part of the Natanz secret program.That program used highly enriched uranium to fuel nuclear weapons, one of the world’s most dangerous weapons. But the evidence does not come from Iran or its nuclear program. Nor does it come from the stolen Natanz material.Instead, it comes from Russian nuclear research.In a news report in the New York Times on August 6, 2007, the Times reported that Russia was “testing a new generation of nuclear weapons designs” in the city of Sarov, about 50 miles from Natanz. The program would “enable Russia to build the first nuclear weapons without the need to assemble them at a military base,” the Times explained.The report described three facilities at Sarov that Russia has designated as “secret centers for nuclear weapons research”:The Sarov center where uranium-enrichment experiments are being conducted is run by Rosatom, the state atomic agency. . . . An expert with U.S. intelligence who has visited Sarov said the facility had been used in the past for nuclear weapons research. . . . The	0
Police are on an "intense" and "extremely focused" nationwide manhunt for the occupants of a black Range Rover at the center of a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that claimed three lives. The incident involved a Maserati that  was stolen from a parking lot on the Strip at approximately 11pm on Sunday night, said Las Vegas Metro Police spokesman Bill Knapp.After two victims died, a third person was found in critical condition in hospital. The third victim has been named locally as Michael Caruso, a 49-year-old Las Vegas resident.Knapp said the motive for the shooting is an ongoing investigation.“I'm not going to give any details on the motive for this situation,” said Knapp, who spoke after the shooting.The Maserati was stolen from a parking lot in the Las Vegas Strip, where the car was being repaired early Sunday morning.The vehicle was described as one with New York registration plates from the early 50s and as an aluminium car with black leather interior, and sporting large wheels and rims. The windows had been shattered or damaged.“We had quite a bit of a presence at that parking lot overnight, and no one else had been seen around there,” Knapp told the media.The Maserati was stolen from a parking lot in the Las Vegas Strip, where the car was being repaired early Sunday morning. The incident happened just before 2am“It's not hard to see where someone is going to get into this car with all this damage and where they're going to leave it, it's pretty obvious.”Knapp said police are also looking into other cars on the Strip which were reported stolen.“We have taken a look at all the vehicles on the Strip with reported stolen plates,” she said.“If it were our car it would have been stolen by 6pm that day and it would have been found somewhere in the parking lot, but we haven't come across any other vehicles that were reported stolen that were left in the parking lot overnight.”She added: "We've seen a large black car with a plate that was reported stolen by a couple of friends while they were on vacation in Florida, but we haven't been able to locate it or determine the whereabouts of the car."Las Vegas	0
People along the Texas coast were leaving home or planning to evacuate Thursday as Hurricane Ike churned toward them, slowly intensifying on its march west. Forecasters say the storm could slam into the Texas coast -- Â and inland towns -- without warning."We're going to be here all evening talking about this event," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Patrick DeGroot, who has lived in New Braunfels his entire life.DeGroot was talking as the streets filled with evacuees and people who had driven inland from Corpus Christi and San Antonio.Ike could hit the coast as a Category 3 hurricane and possibly cause death, widespread damage, and an evacuation order when it makes landfall in Texas, forecasters predicted. It was expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds and some storm surge, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.It'll be a day-and-a-half before the eye passes directly over Corpus Christi -- which sits an hour north of the Texas-Mexico border.The city of Brownsville, across the border, was placed on a mandatory evacuation order as a Category 1 hurricane.The National Hurricane service said it expects Ike will come roaring through Texas as a Category 2 hurricane. There is a 75 percent chance of wind chills reaching into the teens while Ike passes directly over the U.S."We've been able to prepare, but prepare for what you will survive," said Dave Rother, operations director for Corpus Christi Emergency Management, "We're here because we feel it's necessary that we be."Rother said people who could get out now were making their way to shelters -- as are many in Corpus Christi and San Antonio.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said it expects Ike to slow down Saturday with a decrease in forward speed to 10 knots (9.3 mph) but with a chance for strengthening to 5 knots (5.3 mph).While Ike's outer bands continued to roll in Thursday, the hurricane was still about 845 miles (1,360 kilometers) southwest of San Antonio, which was on the evacuation list Thursday.The city was to be evacuated Saturday if it fell to a minimum Category 1 strength. Officials there could not be reached Thursday for comment.Officials at the U.S. Coast Guard said some people who were out at sea were rescued	0
It's that time of year again. This weekend, you'll sacrifice an hour of sleep in exchange for a few months of extra daylight. Daylight Saving Time officially  changes over from what the clocks would normally show. Many businesses adjust their clocks accordingly to ensure that they are in synch with the new time.Some, however, may ignore the new time entirely. A report by the State of Florida found that the State spent over $50,000 in additional costs. The only time, the report claims, that it is not more expensive to keep a company in sync with the new time, is when the company is trying to avoid the expense.The State of Florida is now considering the time zone changes on their own dime. It's not uncommon for cities to make major changes to their time zones without consulting the states in the country.And the company that is trying to change the time zone? They're not doing it on their own dime, either.A company in West Virginia, West Mountain Energy, was the first to apply for the federal government's waiver to start changing the time zone in 2012. It has been in a state of limbo ever since.Even though the government has given the OK, not a single business has started using the new time of day.Since West Mountain applied, a number of states have requested their own waiver. This includes Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey. This is in no way the first business to apply for this federal waiver.The reason for the delay? Because several high-profile companies like Comcast were given permission to change the time zone, but some states have been on the lookout to avoid being caught out.Comcast, in this situation, is not the only high-profile company that has been granted permission to change the time zone.Other high-profile companies like IBM have also received permission to change their time zone for a year. However, IBM has to wait until another year while it awaits word from the government on when it can actually be switched over.And what are the benefits of changing the federal time zone? According to the State of Florida, the potential benefits include:Better visibility of time, because if local clocks are not adjusted to the new time, people need to adjust the clocks when they travel.There's no need to adjust the clocks when traveling, making the system less vulnerable to error.It	0
The budget battles continue to rage. Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins. At best, the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions,  which are paid off by the end of the year and do not contain any program cuts.While the fiscal cliff does not come close to matching the fiscal cliff of the Bush administration, the fiscal cliff that passed in this year's fiscal year will have to be paid for.The two options are spending cuts or tax increases. On spending cuts, Republicans and many Democrats blame the administration and want to blame one political party or another for the crisis. So far, the Republicans and the Democrats have held no one accountable for the government's inability to keep current spending on track.In addition, the Republicans have offered no solution to the budget problem, and the Democrats have offered no alternative to the president's proposal. In fact, the debate this year has demonstrated how extreme the spending cuts must be and how extreme the tax increases must be. In fact, the only thing that is extreme about the spending cuts is the spending cuts. If they are extreme, then the tax increases should be as well. Yet the Democrats have offered no alternative.The president has proposed to cut $1.2 trillion in spending during his first two years in office by closing or reducing some of the most wasteful and inefficient programs in government. The Democrats have not offered any alternative or solution to these cuts except to say that they must be made. Yet they will not even take these cuts--even though they cost them dearly in terms of the very programs they seek to cut.The House and Senate have passed a budget resolution. The Obama proposal is a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The goal of the spending cuts is to keep the government operating at or below the current level of spending. The goal of the tax increases is to make the government pay for itself. The Republican budget proposal is about cutting enough spending so that the deficit will be reduced by about $1.2 trillion.

An undercover investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found funeral homes nationwide deceived customers into making purchases they weren't required to make and failed to give up-front pricing to customers. Undercover FTC agents posing as customers found "significant violations" in 23 of the 102 funeral homes investigated, according to the FTC. Operators violated key provisions of the "Funeral Rule," a 1984 regulation the FTC put in place to prevent funeral home operators from forcing customers to buy caskets or any other item as a condition of paying for a funeral. Another provision of the rule requires funeral homes to provide an itemized price list during the first in-person funeral arrangement meeting. Nationally, Richmond and Fredericksburg, Virginia had the highest number of funeral homes found with significant violations, according to the FTC's report. Eight of the 19 funeral homes investigated in the two cities committed significant violations. Columbia, South Carolina, was next with five significant violations out of 10 funeral homes inspected. Thirty-three funeral homes had what the FTC called minor compliance issues. In those cases, the FTC contacted the funeral homes and required proof they were addressing violations. The FTC gives funeral homes an opportunity to right their wrongs before they're hauled into court. A three-year program run by the National Funeral Directors Association gives participants extra training and additional compliance monitoring. Funeral homes that participate are allowed to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury in place of a civil penalty. Civil penalties can be up to $16,000 per violation, according to the FTC. Jessica Koth of the National Funeral Directors Association says the "NFDA takes compliance with the Funeral Rule seriously." Koth says the organization encourages members to meet all obligations. Since the annual undercover stings began in 1996, the FTC said investigators have found fewer than 400 funeral homes with significant violations. There are 19,680 funeral homes in the United States, according to the NFDA. FTC inspections during 2011 encountered varying levels of compliance: -- In northwestern Indiana, one of 12 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; -- In Maui, Hawaii, none of the four funeral homes inspected had significant violations; -- In the New York City area, as well as parts of Connecticut and New Jersey, one of 22 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; -- In Cleveland, four of 16 funeral homes inspected had significant violations; -- In Columbia, South Carolina, five significant violations were found in 10 funeral homes inspected;	1
Lindsay Lohan made sure she made it to the Los Angeles morgue early Friday for her first day of court-ordered community service. "We can confirm she came in well before her utes," said coroner's spokesman Sgt. Paul Prechtel. "She had a blood pressure, but it was within normal range."The actress, however, seems to have taken the entire experience quite literally. "I think I have just about enough to last me a lifetime," Lohan said upon arriving. "I do feel like if I don't do anything I might not be able to handle it." And then, of course, the real Lohan began to make her presence known."I was out of it," she said, "but I'm used to that. I was crying a lot, very emotional. I didn't want people to know about it. I'm not used to this. I don't want to do this to other people. It really sucks me in."Prechtel was able to confirm that Lohan had a small cut on the side of her left jaw. "We don't know if there was any infection or bleeding that might have made it worse," he said. "I can't imagine there was any infection. She had a fairly shallow cut on the side of the face and it is deep enough to require stitches."Lohan will spend the night at the Los Angeles General Hospital emergency room and then head home. "Obviously, it didn't appear to cause any lasting damage," Prechtel said.Her community service consisted of a couple of hours of housekeeping and yard work before Lohan had to head out the door. She did, however, have to miss her own court appearance, due to the time difference between L.A. and Miami. She said she hoped to get back in time for the hearing on Monday, December 21."That's the biggest thing," Lohan said, "I'm so sad about that. I'm not going to go on my first day to do things I never learned how to do. I can do other things and it will help with depression."She did have an early warning of the backlash that's sure to come. In fact, she said, she was surprised she wasn't fired, even though she did not attend the service. "My parents would have killed me," she said. "I'm sure they were	0
Charlie Sheen has filed a lawsuit against adult film actress Capri Anderson, claiming she tried to extort money from him following an October incident at New York's Plaza Hotel, a representative for the actor told CNN Monday. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, states that Anderson "fabricated a sensational tale about being assaulted, battered and held against her will, and used that fictional story as a basis for an extortion plot against Sheen." Anderson,  whose real name is Christina Walsh, appeared with her attorney  on  ABC's "Good Morning America" Monday to speak out about an alleged  violent  encounter she had with Sheen at the hotel. In  the interview, Anderson said Sheen sent her an apology through  a text message, and "offered money for her silence." "Charlie  Sheen has never offered her a dime to keep her quiet," Sheen's  attorney, Yale Galanter said later Monday on CNN's "The Joy Behar Show." Anderson's  attorney, Keith Davidson told CNN Monday evening that a civil suit  would be filed "very soon" and that a  complaint against Sheen had been  filed Monday with the New York Police  Department. However, a police  representative said no complaint had been  received as of 5:10 p.m. According to Sheen's complaint, Anderson's lawyers contacted Sheen's lawyers on October 28 to inform them that the actress would go to the authorities and appear on morning talk shows "unless Sheen paid her a seven-figure sum." "There  was definitely never an offer for money to silence her or anything else,  as a matter of fact, when her lawyers approached us, we told them to go  pound salt because we knew that Mr. Sheen had done absolutely nothing  wrong," Galanter said during "The Joy Behar Show." Galanter said  Anderson did not make allegations of wrongful conduct against Sheen on  the night of the incident and that she posted on her website "that she  was 'fine' and if you wanted to see  more of her, for a price, one could  enter the website." Davidson defended his client's  right to receive compensation "for the damage to her body, to her  emotional state, and to her purse," but wouldn't go into details about  whether there had been any talk of a financial settlement.	1
A 19-year-old Detroit woman who was shot and killed on the front porch of a home was not shot at close range, according to an autopsy iced autopsy that the medical examiner’s office said today.The Medical Examiner’s Office says the victim, identified as Nicole Kowalski, was struck in her back about 2 feet behind the right shoulder blade, as she stood near the front door with her back to the house.The autopsy showed multiple shell casings inside the home as well as on the sidewalk, but the medical examiner’s office said the shot was not particularly close.According to the medical examiner’s office, Kowalski’s cause of death is gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen, which indicate a gunshot to the chest.The medical examiner’s office said that the trajectory of the gunshot to her back suggests two rounds were fired. The first round hit her, the second round ricocheted off an object on the sidewalk.Kowalski was shot Friday night about 7 p.m. in the 700 block of West Lafayette, the medical examiner’s office said in a news release issued Sunday after the girl was identified.The shooting happened inside the home of a woman who the medical examiner’s office described as the girl’s grandmother.While being interviewed by police, the woman said her 18-year-old brother was the shooter.The medical examiner’s office said the autopsy was performed by Dr. Edward McNeil, chief medical examiner in Detroit.Detroit Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk is the NHL’s most valuable player.

Let me put my cards on the table. I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching "Creature Double Feature" smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah. There was something about seeing these behemoths stomp Tokyo to dust that made me absolutely giddy: the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by A-bomb radiation, the model-shop ingenuity, the laughable man-in-a-rubber-suit campiness. It's been 16 years since Hollywood nearly soured that love affair, thanks to Roland Emmerich's 1998 atrocity. And I was hopeful that the splashy new 3-D reboot might rekindle the old flame. Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together. In one, Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is his estranged soldier son, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition-spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind's hubris. In the other, mammoth CG beasts knock the snot out of one another. Only one of these movies is any good. Thankfully, it's the monster one.	1
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's swipe at federal spending to monitor volcanoes has the mayor of one city in the shadow of Mount St. Helens fuming. Gov. Bobby Jindal says spending for the U.S. Geological Survey is questionable. "Does Â what I am about to say sound like a joke? Let me explain." (Photo by Andrew Harnik/SeattlePI.com via Getty Images)New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu criticized Jindal's comments on the federal Volcano Watch Program, and has promised to launch a lawsuit to challenge the governor's statement.“He’s a Louisiana governor. Let’s get real,” Landrieu said during an Oct. 31 visit to the White House. “And it’s not about the money — it’s about the lives of thousands of people and the safety and security of our people. We’re not talking about a couple billion dollars here, because there isn’t a couple billion dollars. There are a couple of hundred grand, maybe. I’ll take my shot.”New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has already announced a $1 million contribution from the Bloomberg Foundation to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).Jindal’s comments, delivered Tuesday at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting, were a slight response to a question during a panel session on funding volcano-monitoring efforts. The governor, speaking one day after a deadly eruptions in Vanuatu, said, “That seems like an outrageous amount of money, especially when we’re at this point without any money in the federal budget.”“It’s difficult to see how, you know, how a couple hundred grand in a couple of years is going to help when you’re talking about, you know, saving the lives of the people who live there. That seems like a lot of money,” Jindal said.He added that the USGS receives less than 1 percent of its funding from the federal government.“I’m not going to say I don’t want money. I want money to monitor volcanoes,” he said. “But it’s not like you’re taking someone’s life savings that is. This has to be a smart plan. This has	0
The first person ever convicted in Idaho of knowingly spreading the HIV virus is facing new charges for the same offense, authorities said Thursday. An Ada County, Idaho, grand jury on Tuesday returned an indictment charging Kerry Thomas, 45, with seven counts of knowingly transferring the HIV virus, Jean Fisher, Ada County deputy prosecutor, told CNN. In 1990, Thomas was charged with four counts of HIV transmission and two counts of statutory rape, Fisher said. As part of a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty only to the rape charges. According to Fisher, Thomas received a 12-year sentence and had to serve three years before being eligible for parole. He was later granted early release. In 1996, however, Thomas was again charged with one count of HIV transmission, and a jury convicted him, Fisher said. He received a 15-year sentence with a seven-year minimum. Now out on parole, Thomas faces possible life in prison on the new charges because prosecutors are seeking his designation as a "persistent violator." It was not immediately known whether Thomas was in custody Thursday. He was not listed online among the inmates in the Ada County Jail. Asked why Thomas would continue to spread the virus, which causes AIDS, Fisher said, "That's the $64,000 question, for a person who has been to prison twice."	1
A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests  is the first official act of a U.S. campaign to go after Islamist extremists who seek to use the Internet to recruit followers and advance their radical causes.But it’s also an unsettling window into the challenges of fighting jihadists, as America’s counter-terrorism approach reaches out beyond the digital age. It’s also the latest demonstration that the Islamic State poses a new threat to free expression.Since the Islamic State began its campaign of bloodshed in 2014 via the “slayer” video that inspired so many Americans and created a viral sensation, the organization has not been stopped by traditional legal and political methods that can be deployed to neutralize the spread of extremist ideas.In September, a federal jury in Sacramento, Calif., found Anwar al-Awlaki, a citizen of Yemen who was killed while fighting with al Qaeda in Yemen in 2010, guilty of helping the U.S. government by providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, according to a federal indictment.Al-Awlaki was identified in 2011 by a Treasury Department program that tracked financial transactions of radical individuals and had been monitoring him since 2006, when the program had initially focused on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, whose members had trained with al Qaeda in Afghanistan.It’s unclear whether al-Awlaki’s conviction, which came just days after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a mass shooting in Norway that left 77 people dead, is the first in a series of prosecutions by the government to go after individuals for material support to the Islamic State.“We’ve seen the first cases of this new era that can be prosecuted even more effectively under today’s laws than we can under the old laws,” said Jens David Ohlin, a senior fellow at the Norwegian think tank, Center for Security Policy. “Many more more are likely to follow in the coming months and years.”The federal indictment charges al-Awlaki as well as 14 individuals tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula with conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.

McDonald's and Target dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company's barns. The undercover video, released by Mercy for Âme, shows an estimated 500 chickens crammed inside small cages stacked on top of one another in cold, dark warehouses in two McDonald's and two Target stores in Massachusetts.The McDonald's in West Roxbury was closed for weeks, the video shows, but the retailer apologized to customers for the delay. In another visit to a Target store at the same time, a man was captured on film picking up one of the chickens and loading it into his shopping cart."We feel terrible that we have to apologize for this," the corporate office of McDonald's said in a statement. "We work very closely with our suppliers and take every action necessary to ensure that our customers get the highest quality, safe and humane food. Our suppliers are committed to using all of their resources to provide the highest quality of chicken."The video footage was captured at three McDonald's and two Target stores in western Massachusetts. A McDonald's spokesman declined to comment on whether the business had disciplined its supplier. The spokeswoman at Target said the company is cooperating with investigators.Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2601306McDonald's has long defended its poultry suppliers with the argument that they are independent contractors with little control over the conditions of their suppliers' premises.The company said the workers who are seen here were engaged in what has been called off-spec slaughter where workers are required to cut open and kill chickens whose meat should have been discarded. Workers were supposed to be making good use of the birds but instead they were crammed into cages too small to hold them. Those that were alive, however, had their throats slit and their guts scooped out.The Mercy for Âme video, which has been released in conjunction with the Animal Liberation Front, is the first to show the conditions to which chickens are routinely subjected on such farms, and raises troubling questions about how the meat is packaged for supermarket shelves."As a vegetarian, I can say with absolute certainty that I have never seen this kind of treatment for any animal, ever. ... I have never seen anything like this, and I would not eat it again," said Mercy for Âme founder Sara Keim of the undercover video	0
After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is "numb with grief" with the news that he has been beheaded. "It is the news we hoped we would never hear. As a family we are devastated by the news of his death. There are few words to describe how we feel at this moment," his wife, Barbara, said in a written statement released Saturday by the United Kingdom's Foreign Office. "... We always knew that Alan was in the most dangerous of situations but we hoped that he would return home to us. That is not to be." News of Henning's beheading was made public Friday in a video released by ISIS, which blamed the killing on the UK for joining the U.S.-lead bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria. In the same video, the group threatened the life of American aid worker Peter Kassig. UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Henning's murder "absolutely abhorrent" and "completely unforgiveable," saying Britain must work with its allies to defeat ISIS. "What we see with this organization is there's no level of depravity to which they will not sink. No appeals made any difference," he said, speaking Saturday at the Prime Minister's country house retreat, Chequers. "...The fact this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they murdered him in the way they did, shows what we are dealing with, and this is going to be our struggle there. With others, we must do everything we can to defeat this organization" But Cameron also warned the fight against ISIS, also known as ISIL, would not be quick. The Prime Minister said he had held briefings with senior military and intelligence advisers and others, "to make sure we do everything that we can, whether that is taking down these hateful videos from the Internet, whether it's stopping preachers of hate, whether it's prosecuting those who glorify terrorism, whether it's working with others to defeat ISIL in the region."

The Central Americans crossing the U.S. border in massive waves have been described as immigrants or refugees. The distinction is significant and could determine whether the migrants are subject to deportation to their home country or eligible to remain in the United States under asylum. What is an immigrant? An immigrant is someone who chooses to resettle to another country. The United States has a legal process for that immigrant to seek legal residency and eventually citizenship. Many immigrants, however, don't have such legal status and are thus undocumented. As such, they are subject to "removal" or deportation from the United States. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States -- a problem that has led Democrats and Republicans alike to declare the U.S. immigration system as "broken." Congress has been deadlocked for years on how to reform immigration laws. "Migrants, especially economic migrants, choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families," the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says. "Refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom." What is a refugee? A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her home country. As such, refugees can apply for asylum in the United States, a process that could take years. Getting refugee status isn't easy. The applicants have to prove that if they return to their home country, they'll be injured because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. "Refugees are generally people outside of their country who are unable or unwilling to return home because they fear serious harm," the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says. The Central Americans overwhelming the U.S.-Mexican border are Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans. Many are fleeing drug- and gang-fueled violence back home. Is the violence -- any kind -- grounds for a refugee claim? Not necessarily. The violence has to be targeted to a person specifically, and that's where things get complicated. Every case is different, and because of a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, children fall into a special class.	1
A man charged with murder in the deaths of 11 women pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Thursday, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, prosecutor. A grand jury has indicted Anthony Sowell on 85 counts, following Â©nchances to escape and attacks on women, including the death of one.Sowell faces 86 charges in the deaths of the women, some with more than one death, that were reported to police. The prosecutor's office says Sowell targeted victims based on their race. He's expected to face trial in the spring.The prosecutor's office says Sowell's crimes were motivated by a desire to kill white women as well as black women. His lawyer said his client is innocent of all charges, and he was not able to comment Thursday because he was in the courtroom.Sowell, 48, appeared through a video feed from the courtroom. After the hearing was over, he was taken into custody and brought to the Cleveland Municipal Court, where he was booked into the Cuyahoga County Jail. A county official said he would be booked Friday morning.The prosecutor's office has said it's unclear whether Sowell is being held on a plea agreement, a possible trial date, or in jail. It's also unclear whether the charges are related to an incident two years ago, at which point he served time in jail for trespassing and was not released until after this week's killings.A grand jury indicted Sowell on Thursday following more than 40 days of testimony that included testimony about some of the victims' lives, their crimes and how he targeted them. He has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, the highest-echelon defense available in Ohio.The charges include counts of murder; counts of rape and other sexually violent offenses; counts of kidnapping; and counts of burglary and other thefts. Prosecutors are expected to seek the maximum penalty in a jury trial.Sowell had been scheduled to be sentenced in a separate case that involved more than 100 allegations that he inappropriately touched women and girls, but the prosecutor's office said late Thursday it was unable to determine a date for that sentencing.The prosecutor's office said his court hearing was part of a plea agreement. Sowell's sentencing, if that is in fact the result, is likely to be in the spring of 2018, said Miday.An	0
In brief remarks to the media just after returning to her hometown of Seattle, an emotional Amanda Knox thanked those who believed in her and supported her fight to overturn her murder conviction in Italy. "I'm really  proud to be Italian, but I'm Italian," she said. The 25-year-old Australian is serving two consecutive life sentences in prison for the sexual assault and murder of her roommate, Italian student Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy in February 2007. Knox was tried in absentia in Italian court in 2008. The convicted killer was found guilty of murder, but Knox was found innocent on the grounds that the Italian jury was insufficiently impartial due to racial prejudice and the jury foreperson's alleged close association with the judge presiding over her trial. She was sentenced to 35 years in a U.S. prison. In a recent episode of Inside Edition, Knox was interviewed outside the prison in which she is incarcerated. Interviewed by the show's host, Anderson Cooper, the Australian began to cry before responding, "I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison. I want to come here and start over again with my sisters and brothers."The U.S. Supreme Court accepted Knox's petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2012. The case has been widely covered in the media. The Wall Street Journal's "Top Stories" on June 8, 2012 had this to say:"For many observers, it was just another one of a long line of petitions from defendants who said that Italian judges denied them a fair trial. In an unusual step, an Italian court sentenced a woman tried and convicted of murder in Perugia more than a decade ago to 35 years in prison, but she has filed a petition to the Supreme Court asking the justices to overturn the decision."On the other hand, the Washington Post's editorial board commented on Knox's case on June 9, 2012:"In truth, the U.S. Supreme Court may be the best chance the Knox family has for some measure of justice. That's why the case is a big deal. One of the most critical questions the justices want answered is whether Knox, a young and attractive woman who was accused of the brutal murder, will be treated fairly."In a separate article the same day, the editorial board continued:"When she was tried in absentia in 2008, Italian police and prosecutors did all they could	0
The body of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will eventually be displayed publicly "just like Lenin (and) Mao Zedong," the country's vice president said Thursday on state-run TV. "The body of our leader will be embalmed, and it will ... be surrounded by crystal glass forever, present forever, and always with his people," Nicolas Maduro said. Maduro will be sworn in as interim president in a special session of the National Assembly at 7 p.m. Friday, said National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello on Thursday on Venezuelan state broadcaster VTV. The funeral for Chavez, who died at 58 Tuesday after a battle with cancer, will be held Friday in the capital, Caracas. Attendees are expected to include Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Cuban leader Raul Castro and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Maduro said. Venezuela is slated to hold elections 30 days after Chavez died, according to Foreign Minister Elias Jaua. Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger Maduro did not say when Chavez's final resting place, at a military museum, will be ready. But people still will be able to view Chavez's body -- lying in state in a wooden casket at a military academy in the capital -- for at least another week, he said. "Everybody can see him without any limits," Maduro said. "We want anyone who wants to see him to have the chance to do so." The South American nation is in a seven-day period of mourning, with schools closed for the week. Chavez's body later will be displayed much like the remains of former revolutionary leaders Vladimir Lenin of Russia and China's Mao, Maduro said. Venezuelans line streets for Chavez procession CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.	1
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering how to best regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products. While some regulation is needed, the current proposal entails a huge paperwork burden that will create a barrier to entry Ã¢Â?? and potentially a barrier to smoking.The FDA is weighing whether to impose a "tobacco product rule" that would prohibit the sale of all e-cigarettes to non-smokers. To understand why this is a bad idea let's look at a few of the problems it will create:1. Electronic cigarettes are not tobacco products.By using e-cigarettes, a person can still smoke tobacco. The nicotine is delivered to a user using a mist or vapourizer. In doing this, the device is classified as a tobacco product under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulatory scheme. It is not a cigarette, and it is not vaporized tobacco products such as cigars or pipes. Some people may decide that nicotine addiction is a major issue. That's fine. But when the FDA decides to classify this as a tobacco product, it is acting in a manner that it has not done since it first approved nicotine as a prescription drug. In doing so, it's taking the stance that nicotine is dangerous and should be treated as such. This is the same stance the FDA took when it proposed to regulate tobacco products, only now it's a tobacco product regulation.You may think that this isn't a big deal. However, the FDA's tobacco product regulations are still on the books, and a non-regulation doesn't go away when a regulation is repealed, even if it's not enforced.The nicotine delivery method means that e-cigarettes constitute non-tobacco products. There is no tobacco in the device itself or in the liquid that goes into it; it's vaporized nicotine delivered through a device without any tobacco-based ingredients. If e-cigarettes were considered tobacco products, we'd expect to see them regulated just like we regulate tobacco products. If you're looking for a smoking cessation device, you don't want it to be classified as a tobacco product.2. This will create a massive paperwork burden for people who might want to use an e-cigarette for their smoking cessation.I understand that electronic cigarettes are not tobacco products, but this regulation could create a huge barrier to entry -- especially for those who don't want to go through the regulatory hurdles	0
Schools, major roads and an airport remained closed Tuesday, as a thick cloud of filthy smog smothered the northeastern city of Harbin. Meteorologists in the city, which is famous for its annual ice festival, issued a red alert for ices on Tuesday night, which was followed by a yellow alert hours later, as more pollution began coming in on the weather station in the city.The Red Alert meant that Harbin's health service would have to shut down one of the two emergency rooms it operates.The Yellow Alert for the city was in effect for 10pm when the air quality in Harbin rose to unhealthy levels.The smog can cause coughing, difficulty breathing and dizziness.It was also making it difficult for people to see, especially the red lights of traffic lights, causing traffic jams and leading to a traffic jam at a central crossing in the city at the Harbin-Kusatsu Intersection.A red alert is issued if air quality in the city exceeds the air quality standard prescribed by the Civil Aeromedical Administration in China.In 2006, a red alert was declared for Beijing.Air pollution is a major risk to health, and is especially dangerous to children, the elderly, pregnant women, and the sick, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Harbin was chosen as the host city for China's 2014 Winter Olympic Games in 2010.Chinese officials have said they will keep at least 80 percent of the city clean by 2020.The city's famous ice festival is held every year the first week of January in Harbin to showcase the city's ice industry.More than 1,000 tons of ice cubes are produced daily there, one of the world's largest ice production sites.Harbin residents have been using ice cubes and bricks to build a new ice rink there every day since the ice festival started in 2006."Harbin is an internationally renowned city, and its ice and snow industries always serve as a symbol of the city's status and position," said China Daily in an online report.The Chinese capital has been at the forefront of developing major infrastructure through large-scale public works projects, such as the Olympic Stadium and the Olympic Village, and by promoting foreign investment into urbanization.The Olympic games is expected to create 1.7 million direct jobs in construction.	0
The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups. For many players, such lofty expectations could threaten to derail the whole mission. Not so Carter, who is one of the game's true superstars. "I absolutely love the pressure that not only the media and the public put on us, but also the pressure that we put on ourselves as a team," the world's all-time leading point-scorer told CNN. On an ambassadorial visit to London, the New Zealander is taking a six-month break from the game as he seeks to revive his battered body for next year's title defense in England and Wales. Next October's final will be at Twickenham, the headquarters of English rugby -- a place where the 32-year-old has endured both highs and lows in his career. Winning in London Heading abroad to another World Cup where the All Black are certain favorites -- following their steamrollering 14-game perfect year in 2013 -- Carter has every reason to be optimistic. But any All Blacks fan knows better, having watched mystified as similarly all-conquering teams have failed to capture the trophy except for the two occasions the tournament has taken place on home turf -- and they had an agonizing 24-year gap between those successes. Carter knows there are a host of teams now hoping to seize on any sign of All Black weakness: he lists his old Tri-Nations rivals Australia and South Africa, plus England, Ireland, Wales, and even Fiji as teams that could cause an upset. But, he says, the year ahead is about being ready for the challenge. "We had a great couple of years and the hype is starting to build in New Zealand -- especially as a player -- about the World Cup so it's going to be a challenging year in 2014." Lifting the cup Carter had the bittersweet pleasure of watching the All Blacks' triumph in Auckland in 2011 while sitting in the stand, having missed the majority of the tournament with a groin injury. Stephen Donald, who kicked what was ultimately the winning penalty against France, was called up to the squad for the final due to injuries suffered by Carter's replacements. "I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement," Carter says, diplomatically.	1
Rescuers were scheduled to resume their search Friday morning for survivors of a ferry that sank off the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, killing 60 people and leaving more than 80 people unaccounted  for.The ferry sank Monday while carrying a group of expatriates back to Zanzibar from a beach on the nearby island of Shilluwe.The vessel went down on its starboard side and was caught under the ferry, according to the ship's owner.A spokesman for the Coast Guard said one helicopter and about 100 divers were deployed during the search.Survivors were identified by officials on Friday as Italian, German, American, Kenyan and British.The U.S. Embassy in Zanzibar called the tragedy a "tragic loss of life of the highest order.""We extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those lost and to the Zanzibar government, which stands ready for and will assist in the search and rescue efforts," the embassy said in a statement.Rescuers hope survivors can be located and rescued soon, said Captain Komba Mshangani, the head of the Coast Guard."We have a strong team and we are very optimistic about where the people have gone and the chances of rescue," he said."But this is very difficult terrain. It's very dangerous. The conditions are difficult because of the wind. It's also tough because of the water."The incident took place just two months after Zanzibar hosted an international forum on human trafficking.A number of survivors have been identified by relatives through the media, CNN affiliate ZBC reported.Two men were believed to have survived.Among the dead were seven children: a 7-month-old baby, a 5-year-old girl, a 4-month-old baby, three boys ranging in age from 2 to 15, and an 11-year-old boy.Two were Americans: Joseph Seawright, 39, and his sister, Susan.Seawright had recently retired in Massachusetts and traveled to Zanzibar with his sister to celebrate the holiday of Shrove Tuesday, the day when Christians are supposed to be forgiven for sins.His family held a news conference Friday afternoon, during which they declined to publicly identify the two who survived the ordeal	0
Scientists are normally a pretty measured bunch. But in recent months, they've been resorting to some unusual language to get our attention. One top climatologist recently tweeted: "If even a small fraction of Arctic icesheet melts, Earth is toast." Another suggested that we might as well take a deep breath.The Arctic is the planet's last great wilderness. Its ice is melting faster than anywhere else on Earth, including Antarctica. This is a big deal. The Arctic's northernmost point, which is usually a region of frozen ocean called the Bering Sea, is now home to a vast expanse of frigid ocean, from northern Greenland down to the top of Canada's Arctic archipelago, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This is a big, fat chunk of icy territory, about 1.5 million square miles.This Arctic Ocean expanse is just one of three regions around the globe currently experiencing accelerated sea-ice loss. Two other regions are the Caribbean and the northern Pacific Ocean. Together, these three regions are collectively referred to as the Arctic Oceans.The Arctic Oceans cover about 50,000 cubic miles of water—about the size of Texas, more than 1.1 million football fields. And this region is melting at a rate 1.5 times faster than anywhere else on Earth. This is a serious problem because the Arctic Ocean is where all the ice in the world is located. It is where sea-ice cover is highest everywhere on Earth. But this ice has to remain frozen long enough for the polar bear to breed and thrive. Sea ice acts as a kind of natural air-conditioner, keeping the planet habitable for our planet's animal life.It also acts as a giant "greenhouse" for the planet's atmosphere. The Arctic Ocean is just three and a half degrees Celsius above the surface of the planet. That tiny temperature differential gives the Arctic Ocean an unusually large effect on the temperature of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface. When the Arctic Ocean is in frigid temperatures, the temperature difference between the Arctic Ocean and outside the Arctic Ocean is about the same as the difference between Philadelphia and Baltimore, or the ocean and the atmosphere. When the Arctic Ocean is warmer than normal, the temperature difference is several degrees. This is why scientists have nicknamed this area the "Arctic Sea," and why it is so important for the planet's climate and the health of our planet.The Arctic Ocean	0
February 20, 2014 What's behind the unrest in three world capitals? Today's CNN Student News takes a look at developments in Kiev, Bangkok and Caracas. We continue our global coverage with a snapshot of unemployment levels around the  world.***As the world reacts to the latest clashes in Ukraine and the shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines plane, CNN Student News takes a look at the world's unemployment levels, to provide a snapshot of a world where there are still millions of unemployed people and people are still without jobs. So far this month, the global unemployment rate has reached 9.1 percent. The United States has the highest unemployment rate because of the recession the country still feels: 15.8 percent now and expected to reach 15.9 percent by the end of this year. Russia has the highest rate of unemployment, with nearly 39.9 percent of the population unemployed but the United States is still higher, with about 35 percent.Here is the picture of unemployment across the world in a nutshell. More and more countries and cities have reported unemployment levels that have reached double-digits. This includes the United States, which has the highest unemployment rates according to the latest available figures. In the United States, the highest unemployment rate is 15.8 percent, with the lowest at 5.3 percent.The world's unemployment rates have not changed much in the last year. The latest figures on the world's unemployment statistics are from December 2013.While there have been reports on the latest developments in Ukraine, we find out here that the world's worst economic crisis has yet to set in, and economic growth in most parts of the world is stronger than it has been in a long time.Briefly, here is how the world's unemployment levels stand.***Russia's unemployment rate has risen to double-digits since last year, with more than one in five Russians seeking work. It was just 5.8 percent in December. More Russians are being laid off than are being hired. The job losses have been caused by the decline in Russian exports, including oil, gas and metals.Vladimir Putin says the recent upsurge in unemployment across the country has not affected government policy on wages and pensions, and he has been talking up Russia's growth rate in the economy.***A large number of people in many cities in South America have been killed or have been wounded	0
Investigators probably will have to use dental records to identify some of the eight people who were killed in a wreck involving a church bus and two other vehicles in eastern Tennessee, a Tennessee Highway Patrol official said Thursday. Some ers and yers in Tennessee law do not allow for the identification of victims of a crime when the names of specific individuals are unavailable, the official said, but the law is usually applied when a victim is fatally injured and his family has no idea who he was. The law in Tennessee is not unusual, he said, although it was used in the March 19 wreck that left eight people dead and 23 injured. A funeral for 12 people was held for Wednesday. The wreckage of the wreck was located on Thursday morning close to the Kentucky border. (From the Knoxville News Sentinel, April 16, 2000)A federal judge struck down a Massachusetts law that forced abortion doctors to tell their patients that they "might" have a rare and potentially fatal disease. United States District Judge Nancy Gertner made the ruling in a case brought by New England Medical Center, which was threatened with a $13 million lien if it did not comply with the law. However, the law has been on the books since 1980, has received no constitutional challenge, and has never been enforced. The state Health & Hospital Employees Union (HHEU), which represents most of the clinic's staff, was pleased with the ruling, saying it "will now move forward rapidly to develop a comprehensive abortion-provider license that meets all legal requirements. Our license will be issued in time for the first clinic in the state to offer abortions by the end of the year." (From the Boston Globe, April 21, 2000)After a year of protests, a court-ordered deadline for the removal of asbestos in public buildings in Oakland, California, has been extended by six months. A federal judge has ruled that the health and safety of the 1,650 people who work in public buildings in the city must be taken into account when deciding who must be exposed to asbestos. Last week, a judge extended the deadline by another six months, ordering that a special master judge approve a schedule that would allow asbestos workers to be exposed to asbestos without having to remain at their work sites.A federal judge today ruled that a plan to make the streets and sidewalks of San Francisco more accessible to disabled people was illegal because it would require the city to subsidize their wheelchair rentals.

Attorneys and a federal judge are expected to meet in a North Carolina courtroom Friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of John Edwards, the former presidential candidate and U.S. senator. The hearing comes after attorneys on both sides filed several motions, many of them sealed from the public. In December, attorneys for Edwards asked again to delay his criminal trial, saying Edwards had an unspecified medical issue. Last year, the Justice Department charged Edwards with conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He has pleaded not guilty. Last September, the trial was delayed until January 30 after Edwards' attorneys said he needed more time, in part due to his position as the sole caretaker of his two youngest children, ages 11 and 13, after his wife, Elizabeth, passed away in December 2010. The motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on December 22 said Edwards' "unexpected" medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit. The issue will "prevent a trial of this matter during the January 2012 criminal term," according to the motion, and cannot be resolved before the end of the term. Attorneys for Edwards, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside John Kerry, also say in the motion a January trial would not give them enough time to prepare, especially given the "unusual and complex" prosecution. "Since this trial date was set, the government has produced as part of the discovery process an additional 103,102 pages of material including more than 91,000 e-mails as well as 26 voicemails received by cooperating witnesses between 2007 and 2010," the motion says. In addition, both the government and Edwards are seeking evidence from North Carolina state courts. "Absent a continuance, Mr. Edwards' counsel will not be able to effectively use the evidence the government was obligated to provide him ... and this, in turn, threatens Mr. Edwards' right to effective counsel and a fair trial," according to the motion. "This is not hyperbole. Mr. Edwards' counsel are experienced trial lawyers and they are and have been working hard -- long hours, late nights and weekends -- and they have not made it their practice to seek unwarranted continuances." It is unclear if a decision has been made on whether the trial has been delayed.	1
Louis Oosthuizen shot a six-under par round of 64 to claim a share of the lead at the Byron Nelson Championship on Saturday. The South African reached the turn at one under for the day before firing five birdies on the back nine at the TPC Four Seasons Resort in Texas to jump 14 places up the leaderboard. The round leaves the former Open champion tied with America's Brendon Todd on 10-under par with just one round to play. Todd, who fired a 64 in Friday's second round, made more steady progress on Saturday equaling his opening round of 68. One shot back are America's James Hahn, who shot 65, Gary Woodland (66) and Canada's Mike Weir (67). Four players are tied for sixth on eight-under par, with Ireland's Padraig Harrington, Aussie Marc Leishman, Graham DeLaet of Canada and Morgan Hoffmann of the U.S. all well placed to challenge for the $1.242 million first prize. Australian Greg Chalmers and America's Boo Weekley and Charles Howell III are on seven under par. Players Championship winner Martin Kaymer is having a quieter week so far but remains in contention despite a disappointing one-over par 71. The German, who pipped Jim Furyk at Sawgrass last weekend, finished the day in a three-way tie for 15th, five shots off the lead.

In the last six months, the Obama administration has been pushing for a change in labor regulations that would, for the first time since the 1970s, make home care workers eligible for overtime pay under the federal Fair Labor Standards Ã¢â‚¬â€ the minimum wage is $7.25 and the regular pay is $9.25 an hourÃ¢â‚¬â€and thus ensure they are working at a fair rate of pay.As reported by The Nation, the Labor DepartmentÂs proposed regulations, which were published last month in the Federal Register, would exempt home health care workers earning the minimum wage from federal overtime pay requirements. In doing so, they also eliminate a federal minimum wage that protects workers in the private sector from being exploited by corporate greed.Why, you ask, is this a major battle?As home health care worker, Elizabeth, age 23, learned that she is a registered nurse.Elizabeth said, and I agree entirely: Home health care is a vital service, but there are many others.We all know what a vital service we have: Education.I attended a wonderful high school in Maryland, and we learned how to read and write and speak and add and subtract, we learned how to cook and clean and do a thousand other things, we learned how to do a million other services that we do every day in hospitals, home health care, medical clinics, schools, prisons, etc.Yet, it is a very small sliver of what home health care does.I don't know why we feel so badly about this. I don't think anyone would take home health care away. We know how to take care of each other. We don't need this. We don't deserve it. And frankly, we're glad it's free.We just don't get it. We feel that we have been lied to, we don't have a say in health care, we feel that there is no such thing as the "well-being" of a home health care worker, and that the only things we should care about are those that we could take care of ourselves.The truth is we are tired of having our needs and wants ignored or denied by the State. We are tired of not having a say in our health care. We are tired of being told that we don't care	0
We've come a long way since my early days as the associate medical director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1990, I had seen over 500 patients die from a disease that we just couldn't treat. As an infectious disease doctor, I was overcome not only by the tragic loss of life, but also by the inability to find the "magic bullet" to help prevent these deaths. Like many of my colleagues, I devoted my time to caring for my patients and to research. I am proud to say that many of the successful antiretroviral treatments (ART) that were developed emerged from San Francisco General. HIV/AIDS treatment was then, and remains today, a true game-changer in saving lives. In the early 1990s, we made unprecedented progress in addressing AIDS in the United States by putting people on treatment. Yet, when I traveled to Africa in the mid-1990s, I was devastated to see what was happening there. AIDS was literally destroying an entire generation, and eroding the very foundation of many African nations. At that time, 85% of the burden of disease was in sub-Saharan Africa and less than 5% of the treatment capability was there. That was when I realized that devoting my energies solely to international work was the natural evolution of my career. I was determined that this history of lives needlessly lost would not be repeated. We could not -- and our country has not -- turn our backs on the suffering that was right in front of us. Today, as President Obama makes this historic trip to Africa, we are at a point where an AIDS-free generation is within sight. With the world's largest number of people living with HIV and AIDS (5.6 million), South Africa has always been on the front lines of the epidemic. The U.S. government's response to the epidemic in South Africa began in 2003 when non-governmental organizations initiated the provision of ART.  In October 2009, the tide truly began to turn when South African President Jacob Zuma declared: "We need to move with urgency and purpose to confront this enormous challenge ... Most importantly, all South Africans need to know their HIV status, and be informed of the treatment options available to them."	1
The images of Haitian children crying or injured or wandering the streets alone are heartbreaking. It's no surprise there has been a flood of well-intentioned people who want to adopt those children. But that's not always the best immediate move, aid groups caution. Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos. Their family members may still be alive, she said, and "will be desperate to be reunited with them." "Taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families -- a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long-term damage on their chances of recovery," Whitbread said. Hurriedly whisking unclassified children out of Haiti will not ensure the children are happy or safe in the long-term, experts said. Homes and potential parents must be reviewed by professional social workers and it's logistically impossible to do that in a short time. Allowing adoptions to proceed without thorough background checks can lead to child trafficking and other crimes. The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, does not facilitate adoptions, but it has been bombarded with calls from people who want a Haitian orphan, said Christopher de Bono, a UNICEF spokesman. In 2007, UNICEF estimated that there were 380,000 orphans in Haiti, but de Bono said Thursday that he'd "hate to vouch for that figure" because that number -- any number -- is impossible to verify. Between Haiti's "lousy [child welfare] oversight system," and all the challenges that Haitians have endured, it's not uncommon for Haitian parents to put their children in orphanages temporarily, de Bono said. This means knowing who is truly an orphan and who isn't requires great attention to detail and documents. "Removing children who've just experienced a disaster from their environment, from where they're from is not necessarily good for them," he said. Haitian children must first be fed, sheltered, clothed and given medical attention; the next step is to register them and trace their relatives. Diana Boni, who works with Port-au-Prince's BRESMA orphanage, is firmly against new adoptions out of Haiti. "Under no circumstances should we evacuate any child newly orphaned or displaced," she wrote in an e-mail to CNN.	1
Lawyers for New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez have until Friday to respond to a letter from the Major League Baseball Players Association seeking a dismissal of Rodriguez's lawsuit claiming the union did  a "cover-up" following MLB's investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball.Rodriguez has said MLB made errors in its investigation that led to him being suspended without pay for a year from Aug. 1, 2004, until Aug. 10, 2005, and placed on restricted duty for the year, which ended June 12."The Yankees say they wanted me to stay clean, and I do, but I feel I was used as a scapegoat to get me off the field and out of the news. Baseball is my life, and I have always believed in the code of ethics, and I will be able to live with this decision for the rest of my life," said Rodriguez, who also claimed a former MLB investigator, who conducted the investigation, tried to coerce him into taking a polygraph test.In his suit, now in its 12th week, Rodriguez has said that by the time he filed a report with MLB's Office of Professional Responsibility, five months after Rodriguez was implicated in the testing program, the baseball organization "had already made its choice: Either I was an idiot who needed to be 'fixed' by going to the 'daddy' or I was the 'player' he wanted to make an example of."The suit claimed that Rodriguez was targeted because of his "size, prominence, celebrity and prominence" and that Rodriguez's "excessive use of cortisone has no relationship to any performance-enhancing drug." The suit also claimed that MLB's investigation, led by a former New York State trooper, included "unethical, unlawful, and/or coercive actions that deprived Plaintiff's rights to privacy, free speech, due process and to be free from the fear of arbitrary detention, and the right to a fair trial," and the MLB investigation "was a cover-up that could not have been uncovered if it had not been for Plaintiffs own refusal to cooperate with MLB.""We believe that Alex is being persecuted, and we want to help him," said Chris Berman, the NHL commissioner. "He has been a great representative of the NHL and of our sport. He has shown great courage and integrity in this, and he deserves a chance to address this issue."Berman's comments on	0
It may not have been the most dramatic of moments, but it was certainly an important one: Two women, modestly dressed and veiled, walked proudly alongside the flag of their nation Saudi Arabia into London's Olympic stadium at the Games' spectacular opening ceremony. This understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the Olympics itself, as the first occasion in the history of the Games when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams. The achievement was welcomed by those at the highest echelons of sport, with Jacques Rogge, head of the International Olympic Committee, noting with pride in his speech at the opening ceremony that it was "a major boost for gender equality." Women have been the center of attention throughout much of the Olympics, both within and without Games venues, as they broke records, sparked drama, impressed with immense skill and poise and won medal after medal. Indeed, for many, London 2012 has truly been "the women's Games." For hosts Great Britain, the undoubted superstar was Jessica Ennis, a heptathlete of remarkable talent and composure who snatched gold despite immense pressure and the unforgiving lens of modern celebrity. Her comfortable win in the toughest of contests, and her vow to "keep exactly the same and the way I am", sparked national praise and a call from women's activists for more positive role models like her. Scores of other, lesser-known women athletes marked firsts for their countries. Tunisia's Habiba Ghribi became her country's first woman to win a medal in the games, saying afterward her medal was "for all the Tunisian people, for Tunisian women, for the new Tunisia". Games leave London with a golden glow Women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time, and the U.S.'s gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance. On the drama side, South Korean fencer Shin A-lam found herself at the center of one of the most extraordinary moments of the games after the dying second of one match granted her rival the gold. The sight of her in floods of tears, refusing to leave the venue moved many, even if Olympic authorities were unimpressed. But this is not to say there has not been controversy, in terms of sport, and plain, old fashioned sexism.	1
The widely anticipated "Mass Effect 3" will be the culmination of a story spanning a galaxy and eight years of development and drawing millions of fans around the world. In the third and final installment of the series, set between 2009 and 2011, Commander Shepard is tasked with saving the galaxy in the name of the United Federation of Planets.This story, one of the most popular and most successful in video gaming history, was developed from a first person shooter concept by BioWare Montreal. The game was released by Electronic Arts in March 2003 and went on to become an industry standard.The game focuses on the human characters in the story. During game play, players will engage in many different missions which will take them to a variety of different planets. The game revolves around a player's ability to complete these missions, and to develop a relationship with the character they are playing as.The game was a massive success and earned rave reviews. Critics praised the game for its story, graphics, and gameplay. It became one of the most played games on PC and was played by hundreds of thousands every day. Mass Effect 2 was the first game of its kind to exceed 10 million copies sold, and was the highest-selling game of its year, selling three million copies by 2007. The game also received many awards and accolades  such as the "People's Choice" Award from PC World Game of the Year Awards and the "Best PC Game" award from IGN.For this reason, to celebrate one of the best games of all time, fans are flocking to stores and the site of this fan-fiction site. With so many fans, it was inevitable that many fan-fictions would be written and shared. The fan-fic community has flourished over the years, though many have been deleted and the site was eventually relaunched on September 17, 2007, to a more general audience.ContentsThe game takes place in 2154 and is largely set in the same space of the Milky Way Galaxy that we are familiar with today. However, the game alters this space, placing the player in several different galaxies, one of which is in the Andromeda Galaxy. The story focuses on the human characters and the events leading up to the ending of the game, which was announced at E3 2003. This is the story of the first game and will serve as a prequel to the game.The game begins just after the	0
Il Rottomatore -- or "the demolition man" -- is how Italy's incoming prime minister has come to be known, thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics. Matteo Renzi's nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up ills with a blunt policy, but the word was used in the past to describe a former prime minister he admired.A left-wing populist, he is, without question, a political phenomenon, someone who has never been seen as being part of a single group but who could unite liberals with communists, former communists with neo-fascists or a coalition of the willing. In the end, he is a populist; and he is also something of a demagogue, an ability to speak with a strong voice that, over time, has made him a formidable politician and a formidable leader.As a young journalist, Renzi, 51, a lawyer by training, worked for a left-liberal monthly magazine. In the early 1980s, he saw a chance to get into the new political sphere by covering the Italian Communist Party and serving as its political secretary. He left the party, and soon joined the Socialist Party. "There was a time when I was a very loyal communist," he says with a smile.In 1986, he joined the Socialists for Renovation (Sammarinese), whose aim was to make the party into a party of the left, instead of a social-democratic party. By the early 1990s, he was the party's secretary-general, the president of the Socialist Youth Federation (FOS), and, in 1992, a member of the Socialist caucus, the main body of the party.Renzi was not a traditional candidate for a political party -- he had long been on the left, but always on the outer fringe of an electoral party. He became a leftist but remained a member of the Socialists for Renovation. "The Sammarinese left was a very young, very strong party. It was the first time anything close to the left had appeared in the Italian context," says Renzi, adding that most of the party's members had worked for the Communist Party before it was abolished by the Communist Party's dictator, Antonio Gramsci.Renzi had a lifelong fascination with communism, which he absorbed from Italian socialist and communist intellectuals. Later, he attended Marxist conferences, and was known for his fiery political speeches where he	0
The best part of the Supreme Court oral arguments about marriage equality was when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to S&M. OK, she didn't actually mention S&M, but Ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago, when it was "a dominant and a subordinate relationship." "Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled," said Ginsburg.  "It was her obligation to follow him." Mary Bonauto, the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the Supreme Court, said in response:  "That's correct. ... For centuries we had and Europe had this coverture system where a woman's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles.  And again, because of equality and changing social circumstances, all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated." Once upon a time, wives were the legal property of their husbands and "marital rape" was not only not a crime but not even a concept.  To argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve. Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines, at one point referred to "the nobility and the sacredness of marriage." Which is true, if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present.  If anything, the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people.  One downside to arguing that marriage has "always been" between a man and a woman is that, therefore, any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples, too.	1
Spanish rail chiefs testified on safety before lawmakers Thursday, two weeks after 79 people died and scores were injured in a horrific derailment in northwestern Spain. The investigation has focused on the actions of the train's driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, but questions have also been asked about the safety systems in place on Spain's national railway network. Gonzalo Ferre Molto, president of state-owned rail infrastructure company Adif, and Julio Gomez-Pomar, president of state railroad company Renfe, outlined what is being done to ensure the safety of rail travelers. "My desire is to know the whole truth and avoid the possibility of an event of this nature happening again," said Ferre. "This is the best service we can offer to the victims and the whole Spanish society." Lawmakers heard that the route the train was on, from Madrid to Ferrol, includes a mix of conventional and high-speed track, with the latter allowing high-speed trains to travel at over 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph.) Driver on phone when train derailed, court says Two different safety systems are used in Spain: the European Rail Traffic Management System for the high-speed track and another known as ASFA on conventional lines. The train and its engineer were switching between the two kinds of track and operating system in the course of the journey. A transition from an ERTMS-operated section to the other system happened about four miles before the train derailed on a curve near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, Ferre said. That section of track had been inspected on April 20, he said. Speed limit on bend Court officials have said the train was traveling at 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened. Victims mourned at memorial mass After the accident, a temporary speed limit of 30 kph was imposed on the stretch where the accident occurred and is still in place, Ferre said. A permanent limit of 60 kph will come into force once that is lifted. "Our safety department is developing an investigation report," Ferre told the parliamentarians. "Safety in the rail sector is an open subject." Gomez-Pomar said Renfe has started to examine the safety systems in place and admitted that they can be improved.	1
Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race. A crowd protests the court ruling Ã¢ÂÂ a sign of gay pride at the historic court in San Francisco Ã¢ÂÂ in support of California's proposition 8, a ban on gay marriage Ã¢ÂÂ also known as the "Proposition 8" Ã¢ÂÂ which was passed by a lopsided margin Ã¢ÂÂ 51 percent to 49 percent Ã¢ÂÂ at a campaign rally in San Francisco on Nov. 4 Ã¢ÂÂ the day voters turned down California's ban on gay marriage by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent.AP Photo/Paul SakumaOpposition to California's ban on gay marriage launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race.A crowd of about a thousand gathered in San Francisco's historic Hall of Justice as the nation's highest court heard arguments in a major case concerning gay rights.Attorneys for the gay-marriage foes gathered at the state Supreme Court to file their legal challenge. Attorneys for the gay-rights side stayed away.The two sides joined forces in June, when lawyers for gay-rights activists filed a lawsuit on behalf of two lesbian couples who said they were denied marriage licenses by San Mateo County officials. That was the first state-level case challenging California's gay marriage ban.In July, the California Supreme Court invalidated part of the voter-approved ban, ruling that supporters had failed to provide legal documentation showing an impact on California's economy and families. The decision was a major setback for gay-rights advocates.The legal fight over gay marriage spread across the country in early December, when voters in Maine and California rejected a gay-marriage ban.Opponents of marriage equality gathered in Washington's nation's Capitol in early December, calling for the passage of constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage in the United States.Lawyers representing gay and lesbian couples filed lawsuits in all 50 states, challenging California's gay marriage law and any state laws upholding gay marriage, known as "domestic partner	0
U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a "tough-minded" and "pragmatic" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native. Rep. Rahm Emanuel Â a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for 20 years before winning a Democratic primary in 2005 and becoming one of the top-tier presidential contenders in 2008 â will bring a "tough-minded" and "pragmatic" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native.The Obama administration chose Emanuel to replace outgoing White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel served as the highest-ranking Democrat in the Bush administration as Chicago's mayor from 1997 to 2001. Emanuel ran for the U.S. Senate in 2006 and was the Democratic nominee in the 2008 presidential campaign."If the president-elect says he would like to hire a White House chief of staff with similar skills, I think Rahm has that kind of experience and temperament, and he's a very hard worker who's done a lot for the Democratic Party," said Steve Schmidt, Democratic National Committee chairman and a former aide to former President Bill Clinton.As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for 20 years before winning a Democratic primary in 2005 and becoming one of the top-tier presidential contenders in 2008, Emanuel was one of the highest-ranking Democrat in the Bush administration. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for 20 years before winning a Democratic primary in 2005 and becoming one of the top-tier presidential contenders in 2008, Emanuel was one of the highest-ranking Democrat in the Bush administration.As Emanuel was named the White House chief of staff last week, many wondered how the Illinois Democrat would fare as chief of staff to the president-elect, the man Obama has said he will pick as running mate when he campaigns for the White House in the summer of 2008."Rahm was always an Obama guy," said Mike Capuano, a Chicago-area Democratic political consultant. "He would have done a terrific job as chief of staff. I think he is a great guy and an effective chief of staff. I think it's good that he was	0
Spc. Ivan Lopez vented about a range of subjects on Facebook before his shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, including his outrage at Adam Lanza's mass school shooting in Connecticut. He wrote of experiencing overpowering fear after an insurgent attack in Iraq and the hatred that consumed him after getting "robbed." Lopez took his own .45-caliber handgun onto the sprawling post Wednesday and killed three people and wounded 16 more before taking his own life, according to authorities. They are trying to piece together what in his background and psychiatric treatment could have triggered a new round of bloodshed at the same Killeen post where an officer killed 13 people in 2009. A 34-year-old Iraq war veteran with a history of depression and anxiety, Lopez was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder before his shooting spree. He arrived at the post in February after being transferred from Fort Bliss in El Paso. His Facebook posts, which were obtained from a Lopez family friend, appeared under the account name of "Ivan Slipknot," a reference to a heavy metal band. A family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to Lopez. It is unclear whether his posts might help explain his mental state or a possible motive in the shootings. Authorities have said the motive is not known. "Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did," said Chris Grey, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. In early March, around the time investigators said he purchased the .45-caliber pistol used in the shootings, Lopez wrote: "My spiritual peace has just gone. Full of hate. Now I think I'll be damned. Last night I was robbed and I'm pretty sure there were 2 skinny ones. Green light and thumb down. That easy." The details of the robbery are unknown. Killeen, Texas, police said the records department was closed Saturday. In another Facebook post, Lopez talked about Lanza, 20, who killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012. Three soldiers slain at Fort Hood identified Lanza wanted his minute of fame, Fort Hood shooter writes Lopez wrote that Lanza "pretends to be a victim of a mental illness followed by addiction to violent video games" and that the shooter sought "international attention" and a "minute of fame as a villain."	1
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has called plans to build a community center and mosque near the site of the 9/11 terror attack in New York City an "unnecessary provocation." "Peace-seeking Muslims, pls understand, Ground ers have to live with us. We also live with  them. Our goal is to build true cooperation with the Ground ers," Palin wrote in an Oct. 18 column for The Daily Caller.Palin didn't stop there. She added the organization's name to the list of "unruly neighbors" that have turned out "to call America a 'hate' and anti-God nation." "When you see an unruly neighbor, please call the authorities," she added.The call for a mosque and community center comes after a nine-minute 911 call made by Tawheed al-Shehri, the alleged mastermind of the 2001 terror attacks, was played for the jury of terrorists charged with 11 counts of terrorism in the trial of al-Shehri and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian who attempted to detonate a bomb on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam.On the 911 call, which was made during the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001, al-Shehri is heard saying: "I just heard a plane and it hit the tower near the World Trade Center."On Oct. 24, more evidence against al-Shehri was presented, during which the voice on the recording confirmed he made the call. (The 9/11 hijackers were heard making other voice recordings and telling others on the call that they were hijackers and planned to take control of the airliners. The 9/11 hijackers were later shown to make no such calls. Instead, they communicated with one another.)Al Shehri, who was born in Egypt and became a citizen of the U.S., was convicted of conspiracy and attempting to kill Americans on Sept. 10, 2002. But the jury was unable to reach a verdict on all of the other charges against him — including conspiracy to murder Americans and to use weapons of mass destruction.The jury also acquitted Abdulmutallab of all charges, including conspiracy, attempting to kill Americans and causing the death of an American by bombing a United States jetliner. Abdulmutallab had pleaded guilty to a single charge of attempted murder and a single charge of making false statements."That	0
In anticipation of more flooding next week, residents of Fargo, North Dakota, began stacking sandbags Wednesday for the second time in just over two weeks along the banks of the Red River. A trucker relaxes April 1 on sandbag pallets in Fargo, North Dakota,  which is preparing for more flooding. They hoped to fill 1 million, said Fargo spokeswoman Karena Lunday. "If we get a million, that will be a total of 4 million we've made since the flood started," she said. The first sandbag effort began about March 23. The Red River crested at nearly 41 feet at Fargo on March 28, breaking a record that had held since 1897, when the Red River reached 40.1 feet. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning Tuesday, predicting that melting snow -- and possibly rain -- will start to raise river levels on the Red River south of Oslo, Minnesota, this week. Lunday said forecasters expected the river to crest there between April 16-18, possibly reaching 35 feet on April 14. "I don't think people are as worried as they were the last time, but the possibility of getting up to 40 feet is a concern," Lunday told CNN. The Red River meanders along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, so many other cities also were bracing for flooding.	1

It was a shocking and gruesome discovery: three dead infants found in a Massachusetts home so squalid that police officers had to search it in hazmat suits. Now, days later, as investigators continue to  pore over every detail of the case, the question of why a father walked into the house and murdered his children before killing himself remains unanswered.“This is beyond sad and heart-wrenching,” said New England Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists President Carolyn B. Milstein. “I will never forget the look on the doctor’s face when he found them. It was the moment you see a man go to his death.”Here’s a look at the three babies — whose ages ranged from 6 months old to 9 months old — who died a day apart in October.The oldest, a 6-month-old girl named Aliyah, was found in a filthy, dirty room, with no bed or crib on any floor. Police say she had been dead for at least three days. When emergency medical personnel rushed her to the hospital, police said they found no signs of injury or trauma, suggesting the child could have died as a result of complications from being born.Police found the second infant, a boy named Jamey, dead in an upstairs bedroom that was so dark that officers had to shine a flashlight on it to make out the body on the bed. Police said they found signs of abuse in the house, including “unusual” bruising on the boy’s head and legs, cuts on his chest and hands, and a “small circular mark” on his right arm.“It would be hard for us to conclude that this is a drowning or accidental death without more information,” said New Bedford Police Chief William Sullivan.But it wasn’t until police conducted a second autopsy last month that officers determined the cause of death was “most likely a homicide,” Sullivan said at the time.“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my career,” Sullivan said of the second autopsy.All three babies have been buried, in line with Jewish tradition.“We believe that these are the children we’ve taken care of and that it’s our responsibility to honor them and make sure that they	0
How bad is the problem of oversharing online? People are now singing about it in church. A video that's been gaining buzz online in recent days shows worshipers at an unidentified church singing a gospel-styled tune with the apparent title of "Keep Yo Business Off of Facebook." In the blurry two-minute clip, shot with a cell phone, churchgoers sway and clap while a man and woman sing about the pitfalls of sharing not-safe-for-church behavior. "Sundays you act like a saint, but your Facebook posts say you ain't," the man sings. The video was posted online in July but has only become widely noticed in recent days after being shared, of all places, on Facebook. The origin of the video and location of the church has so far remained a mystery. Some commenters on YouTube, where posts of the video have attracted more than 200,000 views, have complained that Christian choirs should not be singing about secular topics in church. "And this is about Jesus how? I mean it might be funny but in the midst of worship service our eyesï»¿ and attention should be affixed on Jesus, not what folks post on Facebook," wrote one woman. "Handle that in mentoring or something." "This church is a disgrace," said another commenter, who called the song blasphemous. HLN: A look at 'Generation Overshare' But others have found it amusing. "Amen!ï»¿ Apparently, God hates your duck-face selfies, drunk photos and gossiping... And so do I. LOL," wrote one.	1
Manchester United are given more injury-time at the end of matches to equalize or score winning goals than their English Premier League rivals, a study has revealed. Owen's 96th minute winner at Old Trafford left Manchester Â£15m in the bank.The study of match-ups found United's first-day loss against Tottenham was the second most closely matched match on the day they had played. Tottenham's early exit was followed by a dramatic win against West Bromwich Albion, which was also closely matched.By contrast, United's 1-0 loss to Tottenham was followed closely by a draw with Norwich City.United were also the only Premier League side to play a draw against a side from the other league at the top of the league.The study, which was carried out by former Leeds United defender John Alder and Nottingham Forest forward John Alder, looked at the last minute of games and compared the performances and achievements of Premier League rivals Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.Alder is the author of 'The Best Way: An Anthology of Alder's Football Writing' and is a former Leeds United player, who came through the youth ranks at Leeds and who later enjoyed a successful spell at Forest before becoming a professional footballer, where he played for the latter's first team and briefly for Birmingham City.United started the game on the back foot at Stadium Park, with Sam Allardyce's team trailing 1-0 in the 37th minute when a Kevin Nolan strike was chalked off by referee Stuart Pearce for handball.United responded with a first-half comeback, when Anthony Martial was sent off after fouling Ashley Young. The Red Devils recovered their nerve and made eight changes to their starting line-up as Mourinho returned from a week-long holiday to bring his attacking players into the game.Arsenal ended the day with a 3-1 victory at the Emirates Stadium, with Alexis Sanchez scoring three goals. Chelsea fell to a 6-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge, while Liverpool lost 2-1 at home to West Brom. Manchester City also fell to a 3-1 defeat at Manchester United, the only first-place side other than United to lose to them in the season.The study also found Manchester City and Manchester United had a longer away-day, with Manchester City's win coming on Wednesday while Manchester United's defeat was on Sunday.In	0
Spanish police have arrested 750 people after a nationwide investigation into fake businesses, according to a statement Wednesday. The mass arrests were part of a crackdown on a scam through ills that saw around 3 million people lose money in the country last year.Authorities launched the “Operation Tenderizer” campaign after complaints about fake businesses. “Fraud is a problem in all industries and especially business in Spain,” Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in the statement, adding that “it is a problem for the entire country.”Officials also said that the campaign was “a great success,” with around 4,000 businesses closed.The arrest of the people behind the phony establishments are a result of an investigation that began last October and involves “7,500 people and more than 200,000 documents,” according to the statement. Authorities say the businesses were “selling counterfeit and imitation products on a national scale.”The raids were conducted by an alliance of regional and national forces including the Economic Crime Department, the Directorate General for the Fight Against Organized Crime, the National Agency for the Prevention of Fraud and Terrorism, the Bank of Spain, the Guardia Civil, Financial Action Task Force and customs services, according to the statement.According to the statement, the operations last week were the “biggest in terms of scale and complexity” in the country’s history.In total, officials detained 750 people — half of them in Valencia, half in Madrid. They found, seized, confiscated, confiscated goods and documents on them. Investigators also impounded three vehicles at the National Police headquarters in Madrid’s Plaza Mayor.The officials arrested in the raids were also involved in other investigations, but have been suspended while they await trial, according to the statement. Prosecutors have opened 15 new cases after the raids in order to try other suspects — which the government said was standard procedure. The arrests were “a reaction to a widespread campaign that was very effective and very widespread,” a statement from the prosecutor’s office said.The statement also said that in the first two weeks, 4,000 businesses were raided, while in the last three weeks, 4,000 other businesses were raided.The investigation began on Oct. 1 and covered a period of time that spanned from July 21 to Oct. 1, the statement said	0
Editor's note: The FBI has one more opening on its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Tune into CNN's "Campbell Brown" at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday to find out who fills the final slot. Alleged cartel hit man ____. The FBI says he is wanted for murder in Mexico and for several other killings in the U.S.A.(CNN) -- The FBI has made another opening on its list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in Mexico, when they added a man they dubbed "The Golden Angel."In a statement Wednesday, the bureau says Luis Raul Ramirez Orta, nicknamed El Angel, is wanted for two murders.His capture is a major victory for Mexican investigators who, last year, arrested a second man, and charged him with murder in an extortion scheme.On July 7, 2012, the FBI in Dallas had captured Luis Raul Ramirez Orta, but let him go. The next day, Mexican police tracked the man to a motel in the border state of Nuevo Leon.The day after the capture, Ramirez Orta drove into the lobby of the North Side Bar & Grill, a popular and upscale sports bar in Dallas with a large Mexican-American clientele. The agent, a trained sniper, fired and killed the man.After the ambush, Ramirez Orta fled. He was captured after running through a wooded area, but escaped again because his release was secured by a "federal fugitive from justice" program known as the "No Place for Criminals" program.The escapee, with the help of fellow prisoners, then evaded capture for eight months, authorities say. During that time, he was able to amass about $1.9 million in cash and property, and also recruit others to help in his escape.Ramirez Orta was captured in May 2013 during an extensive manhunt in the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. The first man was killed when agents fired at a car he was driving with another man inside. No one was injured in that incident.In March of last year, the U.S. Marshals Service said it had arrested a second man allegedly tied to Raul Ramirez Orta. But a federal judge dismissed the charges, and the U.S. Marshals Service was ordered to allow agents to continue their investigation of Ramirez Orta	0

A former Microsoft executive and his son were aboard a turboprop airline that crashed Friday morning into two houses in East Haven, Connecticut, a family member told CNN. There has been "no official confirmation or positive identification" that Bill Henningsgaard and his son were on board, but there is no reason to believe that it was not the two of them, his brother, Blair Henningsgaard, said. Also feared dead in the crash were two children -- ages 1 and 13 -- in one house, East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said. The other house was unoccupied. National Transportation Safety Board investigators cannot confirm the number of people killed, saying there are reports of four to six people dead. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said there could be as many as five people killed in the crash, including up to three people on the plane. But Blair Henningsgaard said only his brother and his nephew were believed to be on the plane. Two bodies were seen inside the home but haven't been recovered because the home is unstable, East Haven Fire Chief Douglas Jackson said at a press conference Friday afternoon. Fire consumed both houses, preventing firefighters from searching for victims, Jackson said, and the basement in the home holding at least two victims was filled with water. Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m. The mother escaped, he said. "It's ... total devastation in the back of the home," Maturo said. The multi-engine Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, registered to Bill Henningsgaard, took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on Friday morning and crashed while approaching the Tweed New Haven Airport around 11:25 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said. The plane missed its initial approach, which isn't uncommon, said Tweed airport manager Lori Hoffman-Soares. But NTSB investigator Robert Gretz told reporters it was possible the plane was on its first approach. The neighborhood is about a half mile from the airport. One resident said the accident wasn't surprising. "They fly in very low, and a lot of times you can hear the engine cut off before it gets to the runway," she told CNN affiliate WTIC. The mayor said the airport's close proximity to residents isn't unusual. "It's always a concern, but it's something that happens in every airport," Maturo said.	1
Catholic faithful from around the world poured into Rome on Sunday as the Catholic Church declares Pope John Paul II "blessed," a step below sainthood. There were cheers as Pope Benedict XVI personally beatified his predecessor, and a huge tapestry protrait of John Paul II was unveiled, showing him as the healthy, vigorous and relatively young man he was early in his papacy. A vial of John Paul II's blood was placed before the crowds, which were expected to be the largest in the Vatican since the late pope's funeral in 2005. The blood, which was taken from him by doctors during his final illness for possible transfusion, but never used, was displayed in a specially made silver reliquary. Next came requests -- first in English and then Polish -- that people put down their banners and flags, and pray silently. "In heaven a very different celebration is taking place among the angels and saints!" Benedict declared in his homily. The current pope echoed the many who credit the Polish-born pope with playing a key role in the defeat of Communism, saying he turned "back with the strength of a titan -- a strength which came to him from God -- a tide which appeared irreversible." John Paul II made a pilgrimage to his native land, then part of the Soviet-dominated Communist bloc, shortly after his election in 1978, and an estimated one third of the entire nation turned out to see him. "Don't be afraid," he exhorted them. Poland's Solidarity union sprang up soon after, and became the most organized and powerful anti-Communist movement in the Soviet bloc. Many commentators said John Paul helped inspire the movement, which ultimately toppled Poland's Communist government in 1989. John Paul II's path to sainthood Benedict on Sunday also praised John Paul's iron will in the face of his physical decline later in his life, saying, "the Lord gradually stripped him of everything, yet he remained ever a 'rock,' as Christ desired." More than a million pilgrims turned out in Rome, police said. Many in the throng waved Polish flags and holding images of John Paul II, who was archbishop of Krakow in Poland before being elected pope. The presidents of Italy and Poland were among 16 heads of state at the mass, alongside seven prime ministers, the Vatican said.	1
Two state senators in California are proposing legislation that would eliminate the "personal beliefs" exemption for parents who don't want their children to be vaccinated. Dr. Richard Pan and Ben Allen's announcement came on the day the state of California announced the number of measles cases had grown to 99. Many of those cases are tied to an outbreak at Disneyland in mid-December. The comparatively large number of cases in California this year and in the United States the past year have sparked debate over whether unvaccinated children should be allowed in public school. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Vaccines are a matter of fact California allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and "personal beliefs," and parents have been using them. "As a pediatrician I have personally witnessed children suffering lifelong injury or death from vaccine-preventable infection," said Pan, who also wrote the California law that requires people who want to file a personal exemption to consult a doctor. He said the proposed bill would focus on vaccinations required to attend school. "We're not reaching sufficient immunization rates and we want to reach the rates necessary to protect the public from those diseases," he told reporters in Sacramento. CNN affiliate KTLA reported several members of the California State Assembly will be co-authors of the bill. Measles outbreak: Different states, different rules on vaccinations Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat. For most people, it doesn't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia, and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While once widespread in the United States, cases dropped significantly because of vaccines. In 2000, health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States, which meant it was no longer native to the United States but continued to be brought in by international travelers. On Monday, a Southern California day care shut down because an infant there -- who is too young to be vaccinated -- contracted measles. The Samohi Infant Toddler Center inside Santa Monica High School, a facility for 24 children of students and staff members, closed Monday after it was learned that a baby under 12 months old being cared for there had measles. It's not clear when, where or how the child got the disease. California day care closes due to measles in baby too young to be vaccinated	1
We're doing well, President Barack Obama told business leaders Tuesday, but it could be better if not for political hijinks in Washington. In remarks at a Wall Street Journal conference, Obama said policy decisions in his first term in response to the Great Recession had spurred a recovery that could be better. "America is poised for a breakout," he declared, noting that stock markets and corporate profits were "soaring" and that "we are in a good position to compete around the world in the 21st century." Now, Obama said, the challenge was to ensure opportunity for all to address too-high unemployment and stagnating incomes as growth continues. In particular, he cited the 16-day government shutdown in October as an example of what he called "self-inflicted" wounds caused by dysfunctional politics in Washington. "We have to stop governing by crisis in this town," Obama said, making clear he blamed Republicans for a failure to achieve compromise on major issues such as immigration reform and a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement. "We should not be injuring ourselves every few months. We should be investing in ourselves," the President said in advocating a budget approach that includes deficit reduction as well as strategic spending on education, infrastructure and technology. On immigration, Obama noted that the Democrat-led Senate has passed a reform measure that analysts say would grow the economy and shrink deficits. However, House Republicans have refused to bring up the Senate plan. "You wouldn't turn down a deal that good," he said. "Congress shouldn't, either." At the same time, the President said he was open to passing a series of immigration reform measures instead of the comprehensive legislation that won Senate approval -- as long as all the necessary components are included. Obama also addressed the major issue of the day, saying the HealthCare.gov website problems have hurt efforts to address the biggest contributor to the nation's debt -- rising health care costs. Asked what lesson he had learned, Obama said that "we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website." He also said the ordeal showed that "the way the federal government does procurement and IT (information technology) is just generally not very efficient." "We probably need to blow up how" the government contracts information technology services, Obama said. In a lighter moment, Obama noted that some people call him a socialist, and he said to laughter his accusers need to get out into the world more.	1
The Iceman has returned to fire up Ferrari. The legendary Formula One team has re-signed Finn Kimi Raikkonen to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014. The Italian marque is replacing Brazilian Felipe Massa with its 2007 world champion as it seeks to end an era of Red Bull dominance. "Scuderia Ferrari announces that it has reached an agreement with Kimi Raikkonen," read a statement on the team's official website. "The Finn will join Fernando Alonso in the driver lineup for the next two racing seasons." Raikkonen spoke of his pleasure at returning to the team which had employed him between 2007 and 2009. "I am really happy to be returning to Maranello where I previously spent three fantastic and very successful years," Raikkonen said. "I have so many memories of my time at Ferrari, memories which have stayed with me these past years. "I can't wait to be driving a Prancing Horse car again and to reacquaint myself with so many people with whom I had such close links." Old foes, new friends? Ferrari will be the only team to race two world champions next season, making it the most potent, but potentially risky, pairing on the grid. Commenting on his new teammate, Alonso said: "I'd like to welcome my new traveling companion: together, starting next year, we will have to tackle a very demanding technical and racing challenge." Raikkonen added that he considered the Spanish double world champion, "a great driver." Ferrari released Raikkonen in 2009 -- ending his multimillion-dollar contract a year early -- to make way for Alonso as its number one driver alongside Massa. Raikkonen said at the time he was "very sad" to leave Ferrari and he immediately quit F1 to pursue rallying. That backdrop feeds a fascinating dynamic between Raikkonen and Alonso as they work together as teammates next season. Pairing Alonso with another ambitious and capable driver is a risk -- a problem McLaren had to face when it signed the Spaniard alongside Lewis Hamilton in 2007. Alonso, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, left McLaren after a single season in which he and Hamilton fought over No. 1 status within the team.	1
On what would have been the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 86th birthday, the Academy Awards decided to snub a beautiful film made about a seminal moment in his life. "Selma" did pick up two  more nominations—including Best Actor—but it failed to earn any statues. The film was a personal favorite of President Barack Obama and played for laughs with black people during the civil-rights struggle, but that wasn't enough for a film about the Rev. King, who inspired this black history month.Selma, directed by Ava DuVernay, is a fictional account written by the late civil-rights leader's daughter, Dr. Janelle Monáe. The film is based on events that she witnessed during the 1968 march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., where she was a 16-year-old student, and she and her classmates were arrested. The story is told with a sense of humor, as Ava DuVernay plays Selma herself, recounting the events as if she’s a teenager instead of a grown woman who served as president of the United States.The film, however, is not a documentary. It's a play of words, history, and the reality of human evil on a stage.The story of Selma, as told in the movie, is largely about the film that's not a documentary: the battle that was waged by those who wanted to turn King’s dream into a reality. That battle raged along with the march, a march that was interrupted by violence and rioting.If you've experienced Selma, you can imagine what it was like for those who led that movement. As a black person, you can understand how this film, a black film, isn't the right movie to bring us to its current moment.Here's how the movie ends: a march takes place in Selma, and President Lyndon B. Johnson tells the crowd there was "only one thing to do." A police officer tells King, "Your men are with you." The march continues.And then, for some reason, there's a woman with a microphone on a platform shouting, "The revolution is coming. The revolution is coming." The audience laughs as though it's a great joke, and that's when what "revolution" means in the context of history, the reality of our current moment, is revealed: a revolution	0
An 18-year-old Panamanian fisherman who survived 28 days adrift at sea is suing Princess Cruise Lines, arguing that one of its cruise ships should have stopped and saved him. A negligence lawsuit filed in Florida last week says the behavior of officers or crew members of the Star Princess was "outrageous and, under the circumstances, so beyond all bounds of decency as to be regarded as shocking, atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community." Three passengers who were birdwatching on the ship alerted a crew member when they spotted Adrian Vasquez and his companions signaling for help from their fishing boat, the suit says. Even though crew members "had clear knowledge that people were stranded in an open boat hundreds of miles from shore in the Pacific Ocean and desperately calling for their help," the suit says, "they consciously ignored the emergency situation and did not deviate from their cruise." The fishing boat, Fifty Cents, had been adrift for 15 days when it crossed paths with the Star Princess on March 10, according to the lawsuit. At the time, all three fishermen aboard were alive. Later that day, according to the lawsuit, 16-year-old Fernando Osorio died, "having lost all hope as the Star Princess steamed away." Five days later, another fisherman on the broken-down boat, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, died at sea. Two days after spotting the struggling fishermen, the three cruise ship passengers followed up with a ship officer, asking him what happened to the fishing boat after their report, according to the lawsuit. "This officer did not have an answer for them and walked away without explanation," the lawsuit says. Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy did not comment on this specific allegation Monday, adding that the company was still investigating the incident. Robert Dickman, a lawyer for Vasquez, speculated that one reason the Star Princess did not stop was because the cruise ship's crew didn't want to get off schedule for their next stop in Puntarenas, Costa Rica -- and, thus, lose money. The ship did arrive in Puntarenas on March 11, noted Candy, but she strongly denied that the crew decided not to help the fishermen for financial reasons. "This is absolutely false," she told CNN by e-mail. Princess Cruises released a statement Monday saying it was "deeply saddened that two Panamanian men perished at sea" and "very sorry for the tragic loss of life."	1
Pop-country singer Patti Page died on January 1st in Encinitas, California. She was 85. Born Clara Ann Fowler, Page was the best-selling female artist of the 1950s and had 19 gold and 14 platinum singles. Page landed on the charts 111 times, and her blend of genres made her a traditional-pop icon. She scored her first million-selling track in 1950 with "With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming," and sang hits like "(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window" and "Old Cape Cod." Her signature track, "Tennessee Waltz," later became an official state song of Tennessee, and her popularity led to her own TV shows on CBS, NBC and ABC in the Fifties and film roles in the Sixties. Ravi Shankar, Temptations to get Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards Page received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Country Walk of Fame. She also won a Grammy in 1999 for her first live album, Live at Carnegie Hall: The 50th Anniversary Concert, and continued to tour until her death. The White Stripes covered her 1948 track "Conquest" on their 2007 album Icky Thump. Before her death, Page was announced as one of this year's recipients of the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Awards at this year's Grammy ceremony. She is survived by her two children, Daniel O'Curran and Kathleen Ginn, and sister Peggy Layton. Memorial services have not yet been made. See original story at RollingStone.com.	1
In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening "sex drive-ins" Monday. The nine garage-style structures, located in Sihlquai, a former industrial zone in the city, are equipped with alarm buttons and guarded by security personnel to ensure the safety of the prostitutes. Customers are not allowed to leave the area with the sex workers. Read more: Brazil drops 'happy being a prostitute' ad campaign "Prostitution has escalated in the city," said Michael Herzig, from the Zurich social services department. "It was done out in the open on the street and men harassed passers-by. "It was noisy and dirty because men took the prostitutes to a side street and left used condoms on the streets. The drive-ins are more discreet and safer." Herzig leads the project, which has cost 2.4 million Swiss francs ($2.6 million) to set up. "The project is extremely controversial. Prostitution is about morals and religion. But we leave these things aside and see it as a business. The humanitarian aspect is more important for us," said Herzig. Around 30 to 40 women are expected to work at the site each night. Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called "sex boxes," but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee. Read more: Ahead of Brazil World Cup, free English classes planned for prostitutes The drive-ins are open daily from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and can only be accessed by car. Drivers have to follow a clearly marked route to get to the area, where customers and sex workers can discuss the services offered and agree on a price. The client can then drive into the allocated box, where the service is provided. There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers. A gynecologist comes in once a week to offer health checkups for the women. The city's social services department is running the whole operation and also offers crash courses in German and self-defense courses for the women on site. "All of this will enhance the sex workers' living and working conditions," Herzig said.	1
Three U.S. Navy sailors were assaulted and had bags placed over their heads during a stop in Istanbul, Turkey, according to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.A spokesman for the State Department said Monday that U.S. Navy personnel were attacked by a group of young men while at a restaurant during an event on NATO's anniversary. The victims suffered cuts and bruises, said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly. He said the officers were taken to a hospital, though no serious injuries were reported. The Pentagon says the matter is under investigation.Some eyewitness reports of the bloody scene inside the restaurant, which is located near where the U.S. embassy is located, were quickly posted online. Some of the pictures taken showed military personnel trying to hold back several men who were trying to push him aside, according to the New York Times. In other pictures, a number of officers can be seen with blood flowing down their shirts.The State Department spokesman said it was too early to determine whether the attack was politically motivated. It occurred "one week to the end of a busy NATO military exercises off the coast of Turkey," he said.In an e-mailed statement, Secretary of State Clinton said: "A group of individuals attacked two U.S. Special Mission Sailors while on holiday in Istanbul. The U.S. Secretary of State is fully engaged on this matter. There is an investigation underway."NATO is a defense alliance of 27 European countries that includes non-members Turkey, Croatia, Greece and Poland. In recent years, Turkish opposition leaders have accused the alliance of being biased against their country. NATO says it is only concerned with the sovereignty and collective defense of all member nations, and not with their political or ideological beliefs.This story was accurate when it was written. Please confirm rates and details directly with the companies in question.A few years ago when we were driving back from Europe it turned out to be a small but really nice neighborhood and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was the place to go for dinner tonight. We had taken some time off and decided to go for a little drive and look at some of the places along the way. First stop was a nice little place we had never been to before. We sat in our favorite corner of the restaurant and ordered their specialty and tried some of it. The waiter came over and asked if I had a preference.	0

Editor's note: Dr. Thomas H. Murray is chief executive of The Hastings Center, a nonprofit research institute on bioethics in Garrison, New York. Murray was formerly director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University and president of the Society for Health and Human Values. Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure. GARRISON, New York (CNN) -- The birth of octuplets to a California woman last week raised a boatload of issues that can distract us from the central ethical question posed by the case: How do we take children's well-being into account in reproductive medicine? Yes, it's puzzling why an unemployed single woman who already had six children wanted a passel more. And it is not crazy to wonder who will pay for these children's needs over the years, beginning with what is sure to be a gobsmacking bill for neonatal intensive care. For now, we can put aside the lifeboat problem: A human uterus is not built for eight passengers; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up. Her physicians offered to reduce the number of fetuses she was carrying; citing her moral convictions, she declined. As of the last reports, all eight survived. Still, knowing what we do about the many risks that come with being born too soon and too small, their medical course is likely to be complex and unsteady. What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine. People who show up at fertility clinics are adults. In the typical case, they've been trying to get pregnant for a year or more without success. When all goes well, a cycle of IVF (in-vitro fertilization) results in a pregnancy and the birth of one, perhaps two, healthy babies. As a son, a father, and now a grandfather, I can attest that there is no more important or enduring relationship in our lives than the one between parents and children. Whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine, adoption or the old-fashioned way matters not at all: What counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care.	1
China's brand new moon rover is already saying farewell. The diminutive lunar explorer, known as Jade Rabbit, or "Yutu" in Chinese, was about halfway through a three-month mission to study the moon's crust when it suffered a potentially crippling breakdown, said state media. The report, authored by China's state-run Xinhua news, was written in the voice of the rover itself. "Although I should've gone to bed this morning, my masters discovered something abnormal with my mechanical control system," said the Xinhua report, in the voice of the Jade Rabbit. "My masters are staying up all night working for a solution. I heard their eyes are looking more like my red rabbit eyes." "Nevertheless, I'm aware that I might not survive this lunar night," it added. During a lunar night, which lasts about 14 Earth days, the moon's surface temperature can plunge to minus-180 Celsius. To make it through the cold, the lunar rover must "hibernate" to preserve its delicate electronics. If a mechanical problem keeps it from hibernating properly, then the Rabbit could freeze to death. Named after a mythical rabbit who lives on the moon, Yutu was a source of national pride when it launched into space last December along with the lunar lander Chang'e-3, named after the moon goddess who kept Yutu by her side. The successful lunar landing made China the third country in the world to perform a "soft landing" on the moon's surface. Earlier, Yutu and Chang'e survived their first lunar night together, from Christmas until the second week of January. The Chang'e-3 lander successfully entered a second hibernation on Friday and is expected to function normally for another year. "[Chang'e] doesn't know about my problems yet," said the voice of Yutu in the Xinhua report. "If I can't be fixed, everyone please comfort her." On social media, thousands of Chinese internet users sent their well-wishes to the little robot. "You have done a great job, Yutu. You have endured extreme hot and cold temperatures and shown us what we have never seen," wrote one microblogger, as quoted by Xinhua. Another wrote: "This is too heavy a burden. If the rabbit can not stand again, maybe we should let it have a rest."	1
If you want to see the impact of Iran's growing power in the Middle East, look no further than Syria. On Monday, three important developments occurred simultaneously: First, world diplomats scrambled anxiously to salvage plans for a conference on Syria scheduled  for later this month, but which was scheduled to be attended by Israeli and American officials. Second, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced for the first time that it would respond to "external aggression" with "full force," which would include "conventional and nuclear weapons" should the Assad regime be "stabbed by a foreign power."Third, the Syrian regime, which has shown itself to be as much a victim as a perpetrator of violence, appeared to be in disarray. The death toll may now top more than 13,000, according to UN sources, and a vast majority of the Syrian people have been forced out of their cities and other centers of control to take refuge in the country's interior. There, at least, they are beginning to feel the impact of the fighting. The Assad regime's attempt to counter the rising tide of resistance by flooding the country with more and more arms has not been helpful; and as the unrest has spread, the regime has been forced to rely more and more on Russian air strikes to repel the violence. But the Russian strikes have had varying effects on a country where more and more of its cities are being cut off from the international community, as the regime has cut off the internet in parts of the country—a measure that has not kept much of the population silent, but which has stopped many aid agencies from reaching the people who can be helped. And, while Russia may not yet be able to restore the electricity, water, and phone service to the country (it has not restored electricity in the northern city of Aleppo), it certainly has the ability to do so.Still, the question remains: Can the Syrian regime survive? Is the survival of the country worth the lives of as many as 13,000 civilians who may be dying, in the end, from the lack of an accessible government? And the question may be even more relevant for a country still recovering from the most devastating terrorist attack in modern Middle Eastern history, which killed over 1,400 people on September 11, 2001.That attack on an airplane with no obvious targets—and little in the way of justification that could be used to justify such a strike—marked the beginning of a massive	0
Reports coming from Russia suggest that hundreds of people have been injured by a meteor falling from space. The force of the fireball, which seems to have crashed into a lake near the town of Chebarkul in the  Urals, would have been enough to knock many people off their feet. While the exact cause of the meteor is not known, the incident has caused fears among scientists that there will now be a rash of meteor strikes around the world.Russia’s meteorological administration issued a warning for all residents of Chebarkul, stating that “the danger of meteorites has become very serious, and all people have to take special precautions.”A meteor fell from the sky near the city of Chebarkul late on Saturday evening, according to a local television report, triggering what is being called the “Halloween meteor collision.”The meteor fell, but its exact path is not known. Local media have given a general description of the object, which is described as a “bright, meteorite-like chunk of fire colored metal about 8 inches long and 3 inches wide.”The Chebarkul meteorite – which fell from the sky at about 11 p.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) on Saturday, November 25th – is on display for visitors at the Chebarkul Museum. Local residents and residents of Chebarkul were warned to stay indoors as windows were blown out.Meteorites are objects which strike the earth's atmosphere and come in the form of either fragments or stone-like objects. The Chebarkul Meteorite, which is believed to be about 60 feet long and weighs 500 lbs., is also on display at the Chebarkul Museum."The first time I saw the Chebarkul meteorite, I fell in love with it.

Perhaps you've come across a recipe or two on Pinterest for perfect skin. We've seen them too: banana and orange facials, spicy acne masks, olive oil cleansers and more. But whether you're holistically-minded, frustrated with drugstore finds or having a beauty emergency, it's not always wise to experiment on your face with that thing you saw on the Internet. We wondered, should you ever put your skin and hair at the mercy of your kitchen pantry? "For the most part I prefer drug store or department store or cosmeceutical products from your dermatologist because they're actually tested on the skin and they go through certain quality control measures," said New York dermatologist Dr. Doris Day. "But in a pinch, there are things you can use at home." You just have to pick carefully and learn a little bit from the past. People have been using substances like olive oil, yogurt, vinegar, honey and aloe for skin care for ages, Day said, and now there are scientific studies that explain why they work. We asked Day, who has a few DIY recipes of her own in her book, "Forget the Facelift,"  to guide us through the "dos and don'ts" of homemade beauty treatments. Think different Here are some of Day's favorite pantry beauty ingredients. HoneyOne of Day's go-to products is honey. "Honey is published widely in medical literature for its use on wounds and diabetic sores," she said. It is antiseptic and creates a barrier on wounds that's breathable, like skin, she said. Honey also helps preserve homemade salves, so you can use them for more than one application. She includes honey in her recipes for acne treatment, eye de-puffing and exfoliating scrubs. It's excellent for treating eczema, she said. AloeAloe, like honey, is great for treating wounds, Day said, and other skin irritations. It is anti-inflammatory, she said, so it's great for the pain associated with burns and poison ivy. Just pop off a piece of an aloe house plant and rub it directly on your irritated skin, she said. "But it can sting when you first put it on the skin, so you have to be a little patient that way," she said.	1
Will placing a tea bag on a cold sore make it disappear? Can you ease hot flashes with herbs? And does putting yogurt on your nether parts have a prayer of curing a yeast infection? It used to be that you'd hear about these kinds of home remedies from your mom. These days, they're touted on websites, blogs, and online forums. In fact, 61 percent of American adults turn to the Internet to find help in treating what's ailing them, a 2009 study reveals. But do these natural moves actually work ... and, just as important, could they do more harm than good? Health asked medical experts to weigh in on the Internet's most popular home cures. The online claim: Yogurt can stop a yeast infection Is it true? No Yeast infections -- and their symptoms, from intense vaginal itchiness to cottage cheese-like discharge -- are caused by an overgrowth of the fungus candida. Because studies show that yogurt can promote the growth of healthier strains of bacteria in the stomach and intestines, people have long assumed it might also keep candida in check. And that rumor keeps circulating, thanks to the Internet. Unfortunately, "no study shows conclusively that eating yogurt cures or even lessens the severity of yeast infections," says Michele G. Curtis, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. Neither will douching with yogurt, or (yikes!) dipping a tampon in the stuff, freezing it, and inserting it -- a remedy suggested on some websites. In fact, douching can cause yeast infections, Curtis says, especially if you're using yogurt; its sugars could actually help yeast grow. If you're sure you have a yeast infection, based on a past experience, Curtis recommends using an over-the-counter medication, such as Monistat. But, she points out, "everything that itches is not yeast!" So see your gyno when in doubt: That itching might actually be bacterial vaginosis, for instance, which requires treatment with antibiotics. Health.com: Is vaginal grooming safe?

Mitch McConnell could very well become the Senate majority leader after Tuesday's midterm elections, but don't count on Ted Cruz to make it an easy transition for the Kentucky Republican. Cruz, a Republican Ã¢â‚¬â€ who has not announced whether he will run for president Ã¢â‚¬â€ was a fierce proponent of conservative policy on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. In contrast, McConnell has been a moderate with conservative instincts for years, having previously held the post as majority whip.Cruz began his speech by stressing what he's been arguing since he was 12 years old: "Don't be misled. Don't be scared." He has called the Tea Party's rise to prominence a "dangerous experiment" to weaken free markets and the Constitution, and has pushed for a constitutional amendment (soon after his speech, however, he acknowledged that his speech was not intended to be an endorsement. "I have no idea what the outcome was," he said. "I can tell you what happened. I was in a minority."For the record, as a freshman senator from Texas in 2005, Cruz helped pass a state law requiring drivers to have a current license (and to pay a fee) before they could qualify for a low-income tax credit. He voted to protect the Second Amendment from government restrictions, as well as to overturn Massachusetts' ban on a physician's ability to prescribe a "morning-after" drug, a measure that Republicans derided as unnecessary and that ultimately was successful.For the record, Cruz's conservative voting record includes not voting for the Affordable Care Act on the Senate floor, voting for a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage, voting against an amendment to overturn Citizens United, voting against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, and voting against allowing states to ban same-sex marriage. In March, he voted against the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and in June, he voted against confirming William Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.McConnell is also a conservative, but is more likely to face internal criticism from within his own caucus rather than from outside critics.	0
I walked into the Gallery of African Art (GAFRA) on London's Cork Street in Mayfair two weeks ago. Opposite the Burlington Arcade, right at the heart of the art establishment, on gallery row itself, African art formerly seen as a niche interest, now officially playing with the big boys. And the best thing ... GAFRA is owned and run by a woman: Liberian born Bendu Cooper. Just down the road in Oxford Circus is Tiwani Contemporary, a gallery that specializes in Nigerian art, also run by a woman, this time Maria Varnava who spent her childhood in West Africa. Tiwani partners with the Centre for Contemporary Art in Lagos, again run by another woman, Bisi Silva. It would appear that women are at the vanguard of raising the profile of contemporary African art. And for those who may point out that three female curators do not a trend make, name checks to Chief Nike Okundaye, Touria El Glaoui and Rakeb Sile to list a few. If female curators are a rarity, Africa-focused female curators are even more so. Yet the message of these women is not a gendered manifesto but a simple statement of fact: contemporary African art exists. Not only does it exist, it thrives. Not only does it thrive, it does pretty well at auctions, as the annual Bonham's 'Africa Now' auction attests to. Read this: Dakar Biennale brings African art to world stage Growing up, my conception of African art was limited to ivory masks and wooden sculptures. Art was what our ancestors did. African artists were dead and anonymous. A quick browse on the Wikipedia 'African art' entry does much to confirm this outmoded view. The page boasts a smiling mysterious mask from Gabon, a bellicose Ife bronze head from the 12th century and a Nok terracotta sculpture from the 6th century BC. The deader the better where the African artist is concerned it seems.	1
It began with a ride home from school on Tuesday, October 9. Gunmen halted the van ferrying Malala Yousafzai through her native Swat Valley, one of the most conservative regions in Pakistan. They demanded that other girls in the vehicle identify her. Malala had faced frequent death threats in the past. Some of the girls pointed her out. At least one gunman opened fire, wounding three girls. Two suffered non-life-threatening injuries, but bullets struck Malala in the head and neck. The bus driver hit the gas. The assailants got away. Malala was left in critical condition. An uncle described her as having excruciating pain and being unable to stop moving her arms and legs. Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip. They operated to remove a bullet from her neck. After surgery, she was unresponsive for three days. Photos: Malala on the road to recovery Now, it is nothing short of a miracle that the teen blogger, who fights for the right of girls to get an education, is still alive and even more astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage. In hardly more than four weeks, she went from an intensive care unit in Pakistan, showing no signs of consciousness, to walking, writing, reading -- and smiling -- again in a hospital in the United Kingdom. Less than three months after being gunned down, she was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home. Her father is now employed at the Pakistani Consulate in Great Britain. On Wednesday, doctors announced that she is expected to undergo groundbreaking surgery in Birmingham, England to repair her skull. And beyond her hospital room, a world sympathetic with her ordeal has transformed her into a global symbol for the fight to allow girls everywhere access to an education. The United Nations even declared November 10, Malala Day as a day of action to focus on "Malala and the 32 million girls like Malala not at school." Ex-UK PM Brown supports Malala's call for girls' education in Pakistan The Pakistani Taliban shot Malala Malala has encouraged girls and their families to resist the Pakistani Taliban, which pushed girls from classrooms, since she was 11. In January 2009, the militants issued an edict ordering that no school should educate girls. Malala wrote in her online diary about intimidation tactics the Taliban used in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan to coerce girls into not going school.	1
England international footballer Steven Gerrard was found not guilty of affray by a court in his home city on Friday. England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray. The jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year. They accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee. The 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an "explosion of violence." Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court. "Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict," he said. "I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now. "I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me." His comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away. Gerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League. Video footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared. Gerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device. In the fracas which followed, Gerrard admitted throwing three punches but said only one connected. He claimed, and his version was accepted by the jury, that he believed he was about to be attacked himself. "You did not start the violence, it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends, John Doran," Globe said. "The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background," he added. Five other men have already pleaded guilty to affray and another admitted a lesser charge of threatening behavior. They will be sentenced at a later date.	1
For years, Kurt Sutter has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for "The Shield" and then as the creator of FX's wildly popular "Sons of Anarchy," a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in California. Now Â he is making Â himself Â into an outlaw himself, with a new HBO series that takes place in the world of the world famous gang.The new show, "Velvet Buzzsaw," is Sutter's first non-scripted work since the short-lived series "Under Suspicion" for the FX cable channel he helped create. It follows a group of characters who gather for drinks in Â the Hollywood Hills to indulge in a series of tales, like a "Breaking Bad" party with no drugs, and a "The Wire" marathon without nudity.In a phone interview from his home in Chicago Â to promote the show and his new novel, "I'm Ready to Kill Your Children," Sutter spoke about his new TV series and the challenges of the show business, his former TV writing partner and writer, Rick Rosenthal, and the impact of being black in Hollywood on race issues.In the interview below, Sutter talks about some of the characters on the show and why they're based on his former writers and producers:Q: What is your show?A: It's based on my experience as a writer and producer of "Sons of Anarchy," my first scripted series.Q: Was it hard to write for an ensemble of people with such disparate backgrounds?A: Yes, I was not the best writer because I was still in college when this show came out. The writers were all black, so I was a little surprised. But I was also excited because I had written "Sons of Anarchy" before, so I knew what they were going to do, but I also knew how they were going to do it.Q: What's the show about? How is it different from "Sons of Anarchy"?A: "Velvet Buzzsaw" is basically the same show as "Sons of Anarchy." When we wrote it, we just thought about what would happen in a party. And, of course, because it's "Sons of Anarchy," the party is in the Hollywood Hills because that's where the set was.Q: Why did you decide	0

Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead. A bloody six month stand-off ensued after Gbagbo ily supported then opposition military commander, Guillaume Soro, during the vote. After the army, Gbagbo's supporters and his supporters were declared the winners.Gbagbo made a mockery of democratic elections with a rigged ballot, and he and his inner circle have been stripped of their immunity from prosecution, making it very difficult for prosecuting authorities to obtain evidence or evidence for trials.The prosecutor has called on the international human rights community to take action against the 12 individuals, and has also made a request to the UN Security Council.Former Minister of the Interior, General Guillaume Soro was found guilty for crimes against humanity by a UN-backed panel of experts. This is the first time that he has been convicted in a court of law.General Soro was tried for his role in the violence that occurred after the November 2013 election and for "torture, mutilation, and other cruel and inhuman acts." The UN-panel found him guilty, and Soro was sentenced to 30 years in prison.General Soro was tried separately and is awaiting the verdict.Other accused include:General Mikhael Yao-Ajouabi, former army general and former minister of defense and prime minister.General Gilbert Diendere, former intelligence chief in charge of Gbagbo's Interior ministry during the crisis.General Lamine Guendoum, the former general of the Gbagbo clan, who had been in Gbagbo's inner circle during the crisis.General N’Gonchadla Bambili, the Minister of the Interior.General Tchouang-Tchouang, the former Minister of the Interior in Gbagbo’s cabinet. In addition to being accused of leading the massacre during the election crisis, he also played a role in the violence that followed after the election.General Gilbert Diendere, the former intelligence chief in charge of Gbagbo's Interior ministry during the crisis.General Mikhael Yao-Ajouabi, former army general and former minister of defense and prime minister.General Gilbert Diendere	0
A series of explosions rocked central Kabul early Monday, the day after Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces. The explosions persisted for some time, and followed ersatz mortar fire, until later the same day, officials said.The Taliban's leadership warned in an Aug. 23 communiqué that an attack was imminent. In its response, it released a video showing Afghan soldiers shooting and killing a militant on the front line. Another showed the Taliban flag raised over the Taliban headquarters in Kabul.The insurgents had been driven to war, but their forces were not strong enough, according to military officials. In order to gain the upper hand in Afghanistan, they had to eliminate the Afghan forces, U.S. officials said."The Taliban is losing. We are losing," a U.S. military official said Monday. "Their presence is diminishing in Kabul."U.S. military forces have been in Afghanistan since 2001, when the warring country descended into civil war. But they could not have entered the country without help from Pakistan's government, which, in turn, was reluctant to allow the United States troops to venture into its tribal areas. That led the U.S. to deploy about 10,000 additional troops over the span of five years, in what would become America's longest war.Still, the fighting and the casualties have been staggering, which is why the United States has been so reluctant to say when the United States will withdraw its forces from Afghanistan."The enemy will never give up," said General John Kelly, who is President Obama's Homeland Security chief. He visited Afghanistan on Monday."They think they have a country and they want to continue to do what they are doing. And they will never give up because they believe Afghanistan is the way to control Pakistan. And they don't want to give up on that because that would mean the end of their empire," Kelly said.In his remarks Monday, Obama repeated his oft-stated assertion that any negotiations to end the war in Afghanistan would require Pakistan's cooperation. That country has long been harboring the Taliban, a group that the U.S. had been seeking to destroy in its earlier war with the militant group."There is a lot of concern here in Pakistan that if Afghanistan were to fall, terrorists would gain access to the country," Obama said.	0
The White House Wednesday said it was "puzzled" by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth. Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book. In excerpts from a 341-page book to be released Monday, Scott McClellan writes on the war in Iraq that Bush "and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war." "[I]n this regard, he was terribly ill-served by his top advisers, especially those involved directly in national security," McClellan wrote. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called McClellan's description of his time at the White House "sad."  Read excerpts from the book » "Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House," Perino said. "For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew." McClellan's former White House colleagues had harsher reactions to McClellan's book. Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to Bush, said advisers to the president should speak up when they have policy concerns. "Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues," said Townsend, now a CNN contributor. "For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional." Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he's read sound more like they were written by a "left-wing blogger" than his former colleague. Rove declined to comment to CNN after the Fox News interview. In a brief phone conversation with CNN Tuesday evening, McClellan made clear that he stands behind the accuracy of his book. McClellan said he cannot give on-the-record quotes yet because of an agreement with his publisher.  Watch further details emerge from McClellan's book » Another former Bush aide-turned-critic says the reaction to McClellan's book by his former colleagues has a familiar ring to it.	1
The first time, it happened almost by accident. Just hours after delivery, a baby born with HIV in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs. More than three years later, doctors say the little girl has no evidence of the life-threatening disease in her blood, despite being off medication for nearly two years. Now doctors say another child born with the virus appears to be free of HIV after receiving similar treatment. The case report was presented at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston this week. The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. Doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs -- AZT, 3TC and Nevirapine -- four hours after birth. Eleven days later, the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later. The California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment, so it's too soon to tell if the child is actually in remission. "Taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care," said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center who has been involved in both cases. "At this time, there is no plan to stop treatment." While doctors around the world are trying to duplicate the Mississippi case, more research needs to be done before new standards are implemented for treating babies born with HIV. "This has to be done in a clinical trial setting, because really the only way we can prove that we've accomplished remission in these cases is by taking them off treatment, and that's not without risks," Persaud said during her presentation at the conference. A clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of early treatment on infants born to HIV-positive mothers is set to begin in the next couple of months, she said. Infants will be started on a combination of antiretroviral therapy within 48 hours of birth and followed "for an extended period of time to determine if the virus can be eradicated from their bodies," according to the National Institutes of Health. The results could be a game changer in the fight against AIDS. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember The Mississippi baby	1
At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, Vladimir Putin told a surprised George W. Bush, "You have to understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a country. Part of its territory is in Eastern Europe and the greater part  is in Asia. The United States never occupied Ukrainian territory, and therefore Ukraine is not a country." The Ukrainians were astonished and angered. The next day, President Bush fired off a furious press release to the effect that "Russia invaded Ukraine on February 22, sending a clear signal that it will use all means at its disposal to regain what it believes was illegally taken from it over a century ago by tsar Peter I and the Russian tsars."Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych reacted by saying, "I will not allow my national security to be used as a pawn in Russian chess games." The Russians were furious, but in the long run, Yanukovych and the Ukrainian people prevailed. For now, Yanukovych is a new sort of politician, one who has successfully negotiated with Russia, while the rest of Ukraine now has to try to negotiate with Russia on many other fronts.A New Role for GeorgiaThe most challenging challenge for Russia in the new decade will be in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, which was a key supporter of the NATO invasion and occupation of Iraq. Russian forces had to contend with the Georgian army, which was deployed to protect Abkhazia, the breakaway region that had been in Georgia since the Russian invasion of South Ossetia. After the first invasion of Georgia, all the Russian forces pulled out. However, the Georgian army continued to be deployed to Abkhazia, and Russian forces began a sustained campaign to remove these soldiers and bring the war to a conclusion.The Georgian government sent a request to NATO for a peacekeeping force, and NATO dispatched 3,000 troops. However, the Georgia government refused to let NATO take the lead, since NATO was already responsible for the protection of Kosovo and Afghanistan. The Russian reaction was to use its considerable air superiority to bomb Georgian military bases and conduct a bombing campaign against Abkhazia from the air.Georgian forces eventually agreed to withdraw from Abkhazia and the Russians responded by bombing and shelling Georgian territory and killing hundreds of civilians.Although many Russians were angered by the Georgian decision to refuse to join NATO, it is important to recognize that this was a result of Georgia's determination to get out of NATO	0
Police and neighbors were searching for three young Michigan boys Saturday who have been missing since their father claimed he dropped them off with a woman before trying to kill himself a day earlier. The father survived his Â©-induced overdose.Police said he ran off, leaving the boys in a wooded area in Oakland County near his rural residence.The boys were not hurt, police said.A search for one of the boys turned up a woman, identified as 28-year-old Tiffany Smith, who claimed to be the boys’ mother, police said.Smith allegedly told authorities she had dropped the boys off at a home on the afternoon of Aug. 30 with a man who told her the kids were not his, authorities said. She then drove to a relative’s house and made arrangements to leave for Chicago, officials said.About an hour after Smith left for Chicago, she called 911 to report that her children had not arrived home, police said. Police said they found Smith at a relative’s house early Saturday morning — the last time anyone saw the boys. Authorities said their disappearance was still unfolding Saturday. The boys are aged 3, 5 and 8.The man who the three children supposedly had been dropped off with is a well-known figure in the neighborhood, police said.Police said the man has allegedly threatened Smith in the past. They said the man had been charged with a felony for allegedly assaulting Smith’s mother in 2011.The father is a well-known figure in the community.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador "to please reject" the request for asylum from self-avowed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa. Snowden wasn't in In a statement released on Wednesday, Correa said Biden's request for Ecuador to reject asylum for Snowden was made during a meeting in Spain where he was headed on a foreign visit. Biden and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa had met earlier this week in Copenhagen, where the U.S. Vice President had asked Ecuador to refuse asylum for Snowden. CorreThe statement said Correa's request for an asylum decision by Ecuador was based on the U.S. Constitution's extradition treaties, according to the Associated Press. The treaties say nations with which the U.S. is party "shall relinquish jurisdiction over, and return fugitives from, any offense or violation committed within their territory in which the accused has taken his abode."The letter read, in part: "Mr. President, I must tell you that I have never heard of a request like yours. First, as you know, I personally am convinced of Mr. Snowden's innocence (notwithstanding allegations from the government of the United States). I know Mr. Snowden as a person who has always had integrity and great human values, who has never made any attempt to deceive others, and who has always lived a life of integrity and virtue."I know Snowden as a person who has always had integrity and great human values, who has never made any attempt to deceive others and who always lived a life of integrity and virtue. Mr. President, I have followed your political career closely from before the first elections here in Ecuador almost two years ago. I have observed you as someone with great credibility and integrity. The United States has been a friend to my country for many years and I have worked very closely with Vice President Biden, with Secretary Clinton and with Secretary Kerry on a number of occasions so that we could make sure that the United States has a long-term and stable relationship with Ecuador. I have done this based on the belief that the United States has the best interests of my country at heart and I also believe that you and President Correa have the best interests of the citizens of Ecuador at heart.Snowden's attorney, Eugene J.

For five years, Taliban militants held Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl captive. They released images of him from time to time. In one piece of footage, he appeared gaunt, eating slowly. In another, the soldier stood next to a bearded man  who bore a resemblance to the Taliban founder.The images and the word were enough to keep Bergdahl captivated—and to send the Americans chasing after the Taliban fighters to free him. On April 3, in the darkness of night, a team of U.S. special forces—led by 1st Sgt. Christopher Beck, a Green Beret from Hawaii, and Sgt. Logan Carman, a soldier from Iowa—stormed a heavily guarded compound of the Taliban. Within minutes, the soldiers took Bergdahl and drove three hours north to a small village called Jalalabad just north of the Pakistan border.Bergdahl was then captured so completely by the Taliban that he felt as if he had been abducted for more than five years. The Taliban never freed him. When that last group of Taliban fighters, a ragtag band of a few hundred, was captured by U.S. special forces, President Obama awarded Bergdahl with the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest honor for valor.And now, on Wednesday, April 11, in the first day of his first trial as a free man, the Taliban freed him again.Bergdahl’s lawyer said he expected to be sentenced to life in prison—although he offered no further evidence on his client’s behalf beyond his brief statement Wednesday.The United States is now at war with the Taliban, but as President Obama’s decision to hand Bergdahl over for execution in exchange for a prisoner swap illustrates, it’s far from clear that any of the soldiers who went to fight for Bergdahl have anything in common with the Taliban. The U.S. government’s decision to go to war with the Taliban—or, more precisely, with an organization that wants to take the Taliban to a new level of war—was always a complicated and risky enterprise.But the Obama administration’s decision to go to war with the Taliban may have made it all the more fraught. The war wasn’t always going to play out as it did in April, 2015. Before the U.S. government ever began	0
arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. "It's the worst," says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber. Cochran: Quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime. McDaniel's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list, while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist. New ads in nasty Mississippi primary This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington. Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife. "Our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever, and the evidence has shown that. What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues," McDaniel told CNN in an interview. The next Ted Cruz? But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent. When we asked for clarification, McDaniel wouldn't go there, replying, "Look, we're going to focus on his record." Three more arrested in Mississippi Senate primary scandal If McDaniel has his way, he would be the next Ted Cruz, going to the Senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles, compromise be damned. "We don't have six more years of the status quo," he said.	1
The death toll of a twin car bombing at a hotel in Mogadishu rose to 11 Thursday, with many of the victims security force members, a police spokesman said. At least 40 other people were injured. "The death toll has hit 11 Ã¢â‚„Âœ security forces spokesperson Mohamed Hussein said at a press conference.""Security forces are investigating the incident and they are trying to identify the perpetrators," Hussein said.The two bombs apparently contained approximately 10kg of explosives. The attack also damaged eight restaurants, a food store and a supermarket."Security forces have closed the roads for the Mogadishu market area in the morning. They will be allowed to leave after six hours," Hussein said.A police officer, who is injured, said that he was sitting in one of the cafes when a bomber walked in and asked him to leave.The officer said he refused and then the bomber threw the bomb through the window, blowing him to pieces.The blasts killed two people, while two women died when a car they were in as passengers exploded.Police later said they were searching for a third victim. The hotel was closed for the rest of Thursday, but most restaurants and other businesses were open.(Reuters) - Police in the southern Philippines on Monday arrested four suspected Islamic State (IS) members on suspicion they were planning an "act of terror" near the southern island of Mindanao, police in the region said.The Philippine National Police chief spokesman, Col. Restituto Padilla, said the suspects were arrested for "conducting an act of terror" in the Maguindanao region where a majority of the country's Muslims live.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the arrests, but the SITE Intelligence Group, which uses militant-related online chatter to track fighters and plot attacks, said it was IS operating in the area.A day earlier, two Filipino soldiers were killed and ten seriously wounded in a suicide bombing at a military barracks in a city of the same name.

Millions of American parents spend countless hours trying to figure out how to help their children get better grades, better teachers or better schools. They may want to take a page from Finland, which is considered to have one of the  best educational systems in the world.Finland has one of the world's longest school-leaving age delays: 10 to 15 years (compared with the American age of 12).Researchers at Finland's University of Oulu recently completed an analysis of nearly 14 years of data collected from 3,500 schoolchildren from 1994 to 2009, showing that their education system had significantly improved.The study was published online Tuesday by the journal, Journal of Development Economics."Finland's education system is one of the most advanced and most successful education systems in this world," said Ilkka Sinkkonen, the University of Oulu professor who co-authored the study. "It really is a model to be emulated.""Students in Finland who do not do well in school are usually not given special education or mental illness and so on," Sinkkonen said. "In a lot of countries it is the other way around."He said school is the most powerful weapon against poor performance for most children."The problem for us is that we spend the most money on the classroom, and yet it is not producing the best results," he said.Finland's school-leaving age can vary widely by municipality but Sinkkonen said children must stay in school from the beginning in order to succeed."The school leaves age is 15 years. If you start school much young, then you are able to develop the mental capacity and to stay in school for 16 years," he said.Finland's public education system is based on a free education system, offering all children the opportunity to go to school. That is not the case in many European countries.Finland's free education system has been the foundation of its economic and social success.In the 1990s, Finland adopted a free education system that began at age 6, and by 2009 it had reached age 13. The number of students finishing school for the first time was about 90,000 in 2008.Finland is one of the world's wealthiest countries, with a population of 3,570,600 people in 2010, according to the World Bank.

UK police arrested four people Tuesday on suspicion of traveling to Syria or supporting the fighting there. Two men, ages 29 and 18, and a 21-year-old woman were arrested Ã¢ÂÂin connection with allegations of preparation and/or facilitating terrorist acts,Ã¢ÂÂ according to a police statement. Police said the arrests were of a family Ã¢ÂÂwho have travelled to Syria and are currently living there.Ã¢ÂÂ Officials said that the four travelers were from Britain and "were not taking part in any terrorist activity." Ã¢ÂÂAt this time, it is not possible to confirm whether or not they are terrorists,Ã¢ÂÂ the statement continued, adding that the suspects had been identified Ã¢ÂÂas far as we knowÃ¢ÂÂ and were being questioned. The authorities reportedly said that the British nationals had traveled to Syria and that they "were not taking part in any terrorist activity" and were taken into custody based on "allegations" of an involvement in "terrorist activity" Ã¢ÂÂThe intelligence service would have been looking for evidence of that."The British Foreign Office said in a statement that the four suspects are not British citizens.Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the Syrian government and opposition groups were trying to develop a broad alliance Ã¢ÂÂin an effort to broaden U.S. efforts in Syria,Ã¢ÂÂ particularly in the fight against ISIS.According to the newspaper, the group Ã¢ÂÂis negotiating to establish a coalition that could include Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Gulf region who are supportive of the opposition. But Turkey and Qatar have opposed the effort. The group is also working to convince other Arab nations to join.Ã¢ÂÂIt said "President Obama has tried to persuade the opposition to form its own, more viable, alliance that could be the basis of an international military force to fight ISIS.

There is a great, geologic break in the land that runs almost the length of Texas from around Fort Worth to just west of San Antonio. Known as the Balcones Escarpment, geologists describe the rift as the place "where the South ends and the West begins." An ecological transition zone between rich, black-land prairie and the arid Southwestern deserts, the Comanche people thrived on the escarpment's sweet springs and abundant wildlife. Today, they would find strip malls, McMansions and 10-lane traffic jams. Five of the 20 fastest growing cities in America might be in Texas, but they are also the municipalities moving the quickest toward failure of infrastructure and other acute problems the state's leaders ignore. Of the 387,000 people who moved here in 2013, some 150 to 200 daily landed in Austin, which has been ranked several times as the country's fastest-growing city. Hill Country, lakes, food, live music and temperate weather explain the allure, but very few newcomers know about things such as the absurd lack of mass transit. The latest INRIX Traffic Scorecard Annual Report ranks Austin is the fourth-worst city in America for commuting. Neophyte Austinites might gain outstanding cheese enchiladas in their lives but will lose 38 hours each year sitting in traffic. A commuter rail train runs in the Texas capital city, but because it was consigned to old freight tracks, it hardly serves the population density. Voters rejected two light rail projects, but they will consider yet another billion dollar train and road initiative in November. Houston, often viewed as a nightmare carscape, has a light rail line downtown that records 5,000 boardings a mile every weekday. DART rail in Dallas also has healthy ridership, but the traffic has not noticeably lessened. Our roads are a serious problem. Because the Texas constitution requires a pay-as-you-go style government, officeholders used bonded indebtedness to avoid raising taxes and being politically punished. In fact, the gas tax in the state has not been raised since 1991 while lawmakers racked up a $23 billion dollar bond bill to construct roads.	1
The conviction of a former New York police officer for conspiring to kidnap, torture, cook and eat women has been overturned by a federal judge, who ruled that the evidence against him amounted to "fantasy role-play." Gilberto  Ramirez-Cosell, who was arrested and convicted in 2011, had spent more than a decade with the NYPD, rising to the rank of detective, and was considered to be a respected member of the force that had been the target of multiple police corruption scandals. He was found guilty after a one-week trial after a jury was shown a video of Ramirez-Cosell and two other undercover FBI agents dancing to "Gangsta" rap music, which played while they plotted a bank robbery using armed confederates. The video, which was made by federal prosecutors, suggested their intended victim was a homeless man who was carrying a handgun. Ramirez-Cosell, who was sentenced to three years in prison, had been the only one of the four men to be convicted.In a decision that the judge called "one of the most stunning reversals ever seen by a federal district judge in a federal criminal case," U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin overturned Ramirez-Cosell's conviction, ruling that "the government’s evidence is not sufficient to support a reasonable jury’s finding that the defendants had the specific intent to conduct an abduction, to cause physical pain or to use the victim for some future illicit purpose." In his motion for an acquittal, Ramirez-Cosell said he was "simply playing a role in a fictional kidnapping. No physical harm had been threatened, nor had any criminal activity been planned." Scheindlin wrote that "the fact that the defendants wanted to cause a victim physical pain without regard for the potential harm, or that they intended to use the victim for some future illicit purpose, is simply fantasy role-play; the essence of the government’s case is that the defendants had an agreement with the FBI to rob a bank, and it was their plan to abduct the owner of the bank, to coerce him to open the safe, and to torture and kill and eat him afterwards."Ramirez-Cosell was not the first of the four men to be acquitted. Two of the four were acquitted of conspiring to conduct a kidnapping. Prosecutors had agreed to drop the three remaining counts, but then discovered a fourth man had been arrested.	0
The attack is harrowing: Al-Shabaab militants raid a quarry in Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them. The brutal act comes just days after the Islamists iced the lives of 40 Christians in an unprecedented attack on a village in Mandera County.A Kenyan police officer watches on as a woman is stoned to death for being Muslim. PHOTO CREDIT: GETTY IMAGESThe violence was launched on September 28, according to the Islamist militant group. The Kenyan police officer on duty did not know what the group was protesting about. A Somali-speaking member of the group told Reuters he was concerned about the health of a pregnant woman, but declined to elaborate.The man who took him hostage, Ibrahim Ismail, was one of several militants seen being led away by plainclothes police officers before opening fire.“I am sure it was this man,” said Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet. “I don’t want to jump the gun, but it looks like he is the only one who can tell us if he was involved.”Kenyan anti-terrorist police were joined by international anti-jihadist experts when they raided the suspect’s home. Authorities did not enter the premises but instead took him to the police station in Nyeri, the capital of the state of Rift Valley Province, where he was interrogated about what he had witnessed. The police also examined the contents of his computers for evidence.The police officer, Ibrahim Ali, told Reuters that he had been informed in advance of the terror cell’s plans. The operation to free Ibrahim al-Tunmi, who is also called “Junaid” by investigators, is ongoing. It is unclear whether he will be charged or released.Police spokesman Tom S. Wanyonyi told Reuters that police initially suspected that the cell had carried out a terrorist attack. But after analyzing evidence and interviewing all suspects, he determined that they were members of a terror cell in Nairobi.The attack, which took the lives of 40 Christian villagers and four police officers, was the third major attack on the East African state.Since Kenya’s 2011 coup and ensuing ethnic violence, its citizens have been subjected to several attacks by Islamist militant groups on churches and Christian-owned properties.

Tetiana Chornovol, a prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist beaten on Christmas, said she has a long list of enemies, and that she was sure she would die during the attack. She spoke from a hospital bed Thursday, one day after a group of men dragged her from her car outside of Kiev in the latest attack on government opponents. "Many people are trying to get me. It was not a provocation against somebody else, I am sure about it," Chornovol told Ukraine's Channel 5. "I mean, I am a revolution activist, a very active one, and I am very well known as a journalist. I've undertaken many journalistic investigations, which are still irritating all of them." She thinks her attackers were paid to kill her. "And I was very scared when they were beating me; I thought they were going to kill me," she said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said Washington is watching the case closely. "We call on the government of Ukraine to uphold its (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) commitments and ensure respect for human rights, including fundamental freedoms of expression ... ," Jen Psaki said. "We urge the government of Ukraine to send an unequivocal message that violence against critics of the government and those who are working towards a modern, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine will not be tolerated." In Kiev, protesters rallied outside the Interior Ministry. Some held up pictures of Chornovol, while others had photos of Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko with words "Down with the bloody minister." Two of three suspects arrested The Interior Ministry said it had identified three suspects in the beating. The ministry said it had arrested two of the suspects. A dashboard camera in Chornovol's car captured part of the attack on the 34-year-old journalist known for her muckraking investigations into corruption among senior state officials, according to the opposition Batkivshchyna party website. A still image from the dashboard camera footage showed the black SUV that struck Chornovol's car moments before the assault. The freelance journalist suffered a broken nose, concussion and numerous bruises, the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported. Face battered	1
Republicans are spending the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's election sizing up the possibility of their first Senate majority in nearly a decade, but with key races still too close to call. Latest polls show some critical Senate urns — including in the Kansas contest, where the GOP candidate’s lead over his Democratic opponent appears to have vanished. We ask how much of a buffer Republicans have from Democrats if control of the Senate remains up in the air.What's at stake in the Senate urnsBoth seats in this weekend’s key contests — in Montana and Kansas — are currently held by Republicans, and their GOP status is likely to remain unchanged after the election.Both states will hold special elections for seats in Congress that Republicans are defending. In Kansas, state attorney general candidate Greg Orman is challenging Rep. Kevin Yoder, while in Montana there’s a Senate race.Both elections will be decided by margins of 10 percentage points or fewer, and in each race the GOP candidate has a strong chance to win.But Kansas is in play because the Republican incumbent senator, Pat Roberts, would face a challenge by a woman, Deb Haaland, as well as independents and third-party candidates. Democrats are also in play because of Orman’s candidacy.“I think it’s going to be an uphill fight,” said Steve Greenberg, managing editor of the Political Report, which is based in Washington, D.C.The Republican National Committee is spending $1.5 million to help Yoder and state Sen. Lynn Jenkins, who is running in Yoder’s place in Kansas. The party is also pouring money behind Haaland’s bid against Roberts, who has been an ally of Trump and a conservative stalwart for years.The same is true in Montana, where Orman’s campaign is focused on drawing a contrast between him and Montana’s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock.But both Roberts and Haaland are facing strong challenges from both parties.What’s at stake in the Senate battlegroundsA Senate election in Montana is still up in the air even after polls last week indicated the race was essentially tied.In addition to Orman and Haaland, the Democrats’ major challengers on Tuesday are former Montana lieutenant governor Judy Martz, a former	0
Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group. The Madrid-based team followed in the footsteps of Malaga and Racing Santander, which were also taken over by overseas interests in the past year. Royal Emirates Group, a conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, has a portfolio of more than 200 companies including oil and gas, renewable energy, travel and tourism, health care, water purification, real estate & construction. The deal is worth between €70-90 million ($101-131 million) and will see the club's title rebranded to "Getafe CF Team Dubai." Getafe's previous owner and president Don Angel Torres Sanchez signed over to his successors in a ceremony at Dubai's Burj Al Arab hotel on Thursday, accompanied by club captain Manu del Moral. The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. "The investment in Getafe CF is an evolution of this vision and an expression of renewed confidence that Dubai's businesses are more confident today to make large investments abroad as well as at home," Royal Emirates partner managing director Dr. Kaiser Rafiq said. "Caring for community needs through sport is at the heart of what the Royal Emirates Group aims to achieve. This will send the positive message to the world that Dubai cares." Rafiq said that, being conscious of football's popularity with young Arabs, the group hoped to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East ahead of the 2022 World Cup to be staged in Qatar. "Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region," he said. Getafe, first formed in 1946 and refounded in 1983, has been in Spain's top flight since 2004-05. The club made a strong start to this season but hopes of qualifying for Europe have evaporated, with coach Michel's team 14th out of 20 with six matches remaining. Malaga became the first Spanish club to be bought by a foreign investor when Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani paid a reported €36 million ($52 million) in June 10. He splashed out on players and hired former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, but the club is battling to avoid relegation. Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over.	1
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's decision to step down from his advisory role at British bank Barclays at the end of the year became the latest indication he's gearing up to jump into the presidential race — and underscored one of the main liabilities he could face if he does run. The move, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes just days after he announced on Facebook plans to "actively explore" a presidential bid. Testing the waters early, Bush's supporters say, will give him the opportunity to gauge his support and tackle some of the more controversial aspects of his tenure in public office and the private sector. While Bush is seen as a top GOP establishment pick for the party's nomination, he's expected to face a fierce fight from the conservative wing of his party if he jumps in the race, particularly on immigration, thanks to his previous support for a pathway to citizenship, and Common Core educational standards. But his record on economic issues and his private-sector experience is certain to spark criticism as well, from both his left and right flanks. Already he's drawn scrutiny over his business career, with a recent Bloomberg report examining his work in private equity and investment banking and declaring, "Jeb Bush has a Mitt Romney problem." Bush aides and allies insist his business career won't be a problem if he runs. "He's very comfortable with his conduct, with his businesses and how he has spent his time since he's been governor," Al Cardenas, a longtime Bush family friend and GOP strategist, told CNN earlier this week. But Bush's ties to Barclays point to another potentially prickly issue for him — his support for the 2008 Wall Street bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which initially authorized $700 billion in loans from the U.S. government to the banking sector. From September through December of 2008, Barclays benefitted from $8.5 billion in taxpayer dollars that were used to bail out failing insurance giant AIG, according to a 2009 report in Politico. A spokeswoman for the governor said, however, he didn't join the firm until March 20, 2009. But years later, during a 2012 hearing on Capitol Hill, Bush endorsed the bailout. "For a short-term solution to a problem that had global implication, I think that was probably the right thing to do," he said.	1
Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds. Watch this commercial—or better yet, if you don't understand Hindi, read on. A smarmy-looking politician addresses a rural gathering, promising to ersatz an Indian identity. He promises to create a new reality in the villages to create a new India—one where poverty is eradicated, India becomes a "greater nation," and a sense of national identity will be created and maintained. And at the end he offers to give each man a piece of his new India.AdvertisementThere are a thousand ways in which politicians might promise to give people a piece of their new India. But this one is simple and it's the best: they'll give you a piece of your India in the form of an Indian headdress.

The leaders of Kenya, Somalia and Uganda held a closed-door meeting in Nairobi Wednesday, reaffirming their commitment to military operations against the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Presidents Mwai ÃÂiÂkiÂaÂ of Kenya, Mohamed Abdullahi Ade ÃÂoÂ Abubakar ÃÂoÂ of Somalia and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda discussed "measures to be taken to strengthen security, stability and peace in Somalia," according to a media statement from the three presidents.The leaders also "strongly reaffirmed their commitment to international solidarity for the Somali people, and agreed to establish, in a timely manner, a multi-party transitional authority to secure peace and stability in Somalia through peace, national reconciliation and national dialogue, and to lead and guide it." They also "agreed to strengthen the political, security and humanitarian aspects of international military operations to ensure security and stability."Earlier this month, President Mwai ÃÂiÂkiÂaÂ of Kenya joined his counterparts from other regional powers in issuing an international ultimatum to Somalia's Al-Shabaab terrorist group, demanding that it stop its armed attacks.Ugandan President Museveni, for his part, has been supporting the effort of Kenya and its allies to combat the radical force since the beginning of the year.Somali Foreign Minister Hassan Mohamed Guled, who hosted the leaders' meeting, said that the regional powers have agreed to "work with one another to ensure Somalia maintains its territorial integrity and avoids the use of Somalia as a transit point for the transit of armed insurgents, terrorists and criminals fleeing from other countries to Somalia."The Al-Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab has seized control of large parts of the country for years, imposing sharia law, seizing control of local administrations in cities like Garowe in Puntland and Baidoa in the south and using them to carry out daily armed assaults on residents and businesses.In the latest conflict, Al-Shabaab took control of the city of Galkacyo in early February and imposed a strict version of sharia law and shut down schools, bars, restaurants, shops and other areas.A	0
Police arrested another teen Thursday, the sixth suspect jailed in connection with the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on a northern California high school campus. Â The suspect in the other case was identified as a 17-year-old male student, who already has a criminal record. Â The boy was arrested by Riverside County Sheriff’s Department Sheriff’s Sgt. Greg Weems at 5:40 p.m. Thursday in Woodland Hills. He was booked at 8:38 p.m. and is being held on $300,000 bail. Â Police said the victim’s family “is extremely happy” with the arrests. Â “The case is moving along,” Weems said. “We’re seeing the prosecution getting down to facts and evidence. We’re moving forward.” Â The teen was caught in the act after a student reported to school officials that someone had sexually assaulted her. Â Police said they had to wait for forensic evidence to come in from the rape kits, but were able to identify the suspect in the earlier case as a student on a social media photo-sharing app. Â The victim was one of three girls to be attacked on the afternoon of April 12 on a high school track team in Woodlands. The teen was found badly wounded at about 5:20 p.m. after reporting the attack. Â The teens were all members of the track team, and the student and the victim were juniors, along with a freshman and a sophomore. Â Â Â Â Â Â ÂThe Washington Times says U.S. Department of Justice officials say an Arizona man is not legally eligible for a gun permit since he was previously convicted of a violent crime in New York.Â Â In a filing filed with the U.S. District Court, officials say an investigation into an application by Anthony Martinez show he was found guilty of a crime in New York.Â Â Martinez was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree in a 2001 incident, authorities say.Â Â Martinez, of Scottsdale, was sentenced to six months in prison. He was then allowed to walk out after two years probation on the weapons charge. Â At the time, the New York State Department of Law Enforcement listed the incident as a “violent crime.”	0
The U.S. military bombed about 300 tons of poppy seeds in a dusty field in southern Afghanistan Tuesday in a dramatic show of force designed to break up the Taliban's connection to heroin. The U.S. military bombed about ໄ3,500 pounds ໄ1,500 pounds of poppy seeds in a dusty field in southern Afghanistan Tuesday in a dramatic show of force designed to break up the Taliban's connection to heroin. "We need to target poppy fields in order to disrupt the Taliban's heroin trafficking to Pakistan," said Lt. Col. John Llewellyn Wilson, spokesman for the U.S.-led campaign against the Taliban. The U.S. Air Force dropped a total of ໄ2,000 pounds ໄ1,100 pounds of P.E.D.C., short for precision, earth-penetrating, anti-personnel-dome, cluster-bomb, on a poppy field in southern Afghanistan. During the May 1 attacks, which lasted about 15 minutes, the Taliban had previously refused to allow U.S. aircraft to fly low into their territory to drop the bombs. U.S. aircraft bombed about 300 tons of poppy seeds in a ໄ300-hectare (1,500-acre) poppy field, after U.S. aircraft flew over the area and detected a Taliban presence, the U.S. military said. The U.S. military also bombed a ໄ8-hectare (17-acre) poppy field in southern Afghanistan during May, after receiving a tip from the Afghan Inter-Agency Council, which monitors Taliban activity. "The Taliban is not a terrorist organization but a narco-terrorist organization used to intimidate the government and to funnel drugs into Pakistan," said Lt. Col. Wilson, speaking at a daily press briefing in Kabul. "If we can disrupt this drug trafficking in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, we will be able to reduce the amount of drugs that they sell and they won't need to use their terrorism to sell drugs." U.S. military officials said the bombs were dropped as part of a larger effort to disrupt the Taliban's connections to the heroin trade, which the U.S. military estimates to be worth more than $11 billion a year. U.S. officials said the P.E.D.C. should be used only against terrorist groups such as the Taliban because the bombs	0
German prosecutors ordered the arrest this week of a German citizen on suspicion of spying for foreign intelligence agencies. A day later, on Friday, the German foreign office called in the U.S. ambassador to discuss it. Foreign Secretary Stephan Steinlein "requested the U.S. ambassador participate in a rapid solving" of the spying case, Germany's foreign office said in a statement. Both the German prosecutor and the foreign office released scarce information, but officials have spoken in detail with German journalists, who published many reports on the allegations of renewed U.S. spying on the country. The reports re-inflamed public anger at the U.S. government. The suspect, a German intelligence employee, allegedly stole government documents, according to German media reports. These included papers taken from the German parliament's special committee to address the National Security Agency spying. The employee allegedly sold them to U.S. intelligence representatives for thousands of dollars, according to multiple reports.

Not everyone subscribes to a New Year's resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014. Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois  and a $300 fine for spitting in public. Some will become law without formal congressional approval, like the FAA's new rules for drones, and others will result in legal wrangling. Some measures will simply be passed by the U.S. Congress over the objections of the administration, as the FAA's rules for drones did in October.For the full report of the 2013 SOTU, visit our home page and bookmark it for future reference.The following text may not be republished without the express permission of the Secretary of Commerce.The SOTU was originally scheduled to be held on February 6, 2013.

The SOTU was rescheduled for February 26, 2013, to take place in the Grand Ballroom of Union Station in Washington, D.C.In the speech, the President addressed the need to balance national security interests with the importance of economic growth and freedom. He cited economic benefits stemming from the U.S. being able to "deter and prevent" terrorism and other threats.  However, he said, the U.S. cannot "lose sight of our responsibilities to take care of our own citizens."

The Department of Justice announced on Thursday it has reached an agreement with the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to address a "pattern or practice of excessive force" by the problem-plagued Albuquerque Police Department. The DOJ said Ã¢â?¬Å?a federal grand jury determined this week that the city had engaged in a systemwide pattern or practice of excessive use of deadly force against the Albuquerque Police DepartmentÃ¢â?¬â? between July 1, 2011, and July 1, 2012.Ã¢â?¬ÂAs detailed in the DOJ announcement, Albuquerque police officers began using excessive force in the first six months of 2012, with officers using less force the more time they spent on patrol. The use of force rose steadily, with the percentage of cases in which an officer was shot by a suspect during a high-profile vehicle stop reaching a new high. The announcement also includes details regarding the DOJâ€™s decision to charge the city with civil rights violations.The first shooting of a police officer in Albuquerque occurred on December 19, 2011. That shooting resulted in the death of Officer Javier Acosta, who was shot at the end of a high-speed car pursuit.The DOJ said the case was examined in detail by a federal grand jury in May and "after considering information presented by the DOJ and the Albuquerque Police Department, the grand jury returned a 31-count indictment against several individuals who were involved in the police shooting." Those individuals include two police officers. A number of the former officers and other current city employees have been placed on leave.The announcement said Albuquerque police Chief Gorden Eden has implemented measures to address the use of force and he and Lt. Gov. David McKinty issued statements acknowledging the issue in a public forum during Albuquerque City Council meeting. The DOJ, in its brief, said the changes have been "substantive in nature and have reduced levels of force." Albuquerque police spokesman Jon Swider said the department could not comment on internal affairs investigations, the use of force and its relationship with outside organizations.After the fatal shooting in New Mexico, federal officials have expressed concerns about the department following a pattern or practice that resulted in the unjustified use of deadly force, the DOJ said. On Thursday, the DOJ described that pattern or practice as Ã¢â?¬Å?failure to properly train and supervise the police departmentÃ	0
A GOP-inspired effort to tinker with the Electoral College machinery in California is raising alarm bells among Democrats who fear it could doom the party's chances of winning the White House in 2008. A GOP-led group submitted a proposal to state Attorney General Jerry Brown that could sway the '08 presidential race. Democrats have come to rely on California's block of 55 electoral votes -- the largest haul available in any state -- as part of their arithmetic to win the presidency with a majority in the Electoral College. A group called Californians for Equal Representation has submitted a ballot initiative to state Attorney General Jerry Brown that would change the current statewide winner-take-all system to a formula based on congressional districts. Republicans say the idea is aimed at attracting presidential candidates to campaign in California, which they rarely do because the statewide vote traditionally leans Democratic. Opponents call the proposal an attempt to grab Democratic votes. Under the proposal, the winning candidate in each of the state's 53 congressional districts would get one electoral vote, with two votes going to the statewide winner. Supporters want to put the proposal on the ballot for next June's state primary, which would put the change into effect for the 2008 election. Do to so, supporters will have to collect about 434,000 petition signatures from registered voters by November 13, according to the secretary of state's office. In the 2006 election, Californians elected 34 Democrats and 19 Republicans to the House. Had the proposed system been in effect in 2004, President Bush would have captured 22 of California's electoral votes. The extra electoral votes would have eliminated Bush's need to carry the pivotal state of Ohio to win re-election. "This would all but guarantee that the Republican nominee would get 20 extra Electoral College votes, which could certainly impact the outcome of the election," said Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican strategist. And that is exactly what has Democrats crying foul. "The Republicans are doing this in California because they want a chunk of our vote," said Darry Sragow, a Democratic strategist. The ballot initiative was submitted by Thomas Hiltachk, a Sacramento election lawyer who is also general counsel for Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The purpose of the change is to make California more relevant in presidential elections by forcing candidates to campaign in the state, according to the initiative. "Because this is a reliable Democratic state, none of the presidential candidates -- Republican or Democrat -- ever shows up in California," Hoffenblum said.	1
Two quick-thinking passengers in the third row of a United flight to Denver tackled and subdued a man who was heading toward the cockpit, other travelers on the plane told CNN on Tuesday. The incident started shortly after United Flight 1074 took off around 10:15 p.m. Monday from Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington. The Boeing 737 jet was supposed to take its 33 passengers and six crew members to Denver, but turned back because the unnamed passenger "failed to comply with crew instructions," United Airlines spokesman Luke Punzenberger said. Joshua Lindstrom told "Anderson Cooper 360˚" Tuesday night that a man was acting strangely as he moved up the aisle. "The flight attendant gave some sort of command to stand back, and he turned and started heading toward the cockpit. And the guy in 3E was a lightning bolt and just jumped out of his seat and took the guy down to the ground." The hero's seatmate piled on and grabbed the out-of-control passenger's legs, Lindstrom said. Passenger Donna Tellam told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" the men reacted so quickly she thought they were air marshals. She said the unruly man had come down the aisle, screaming about the plane going too slow and flailing his arms. A flight attendant used plastic ties to bind the man's wrists as the plane headed back, she said. Earlier, a government official with direct knowledge of the incident told CNN that the detained passenger had run toward the cockpit screaming "jihad, jihad." Lindstrom told Cooper he didn't hear those words but after the flight was back on the ground the man who tackled the unruly passenger mentioned it. "He said, 'Did you hear it?  Like he said 'jihad' a couple times (while he was being restrained)," Lindstrom said. "... In the end it was more surreal than it was scary. It was wild." Lindstrom said two other people helped keep the man on the floor for the 20 minutes or so that it took the flight crew to return to Dulles. During that time, the subdued man's mood would change. The man was rattling on about someone trying to bring the plane down, then become despondent and cry, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."	1
Americans love beef; we eat nearly 63 pounds per person each year. Although that's a lot, the amount is down from our 1976 high of 89 pounds. When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60  percent of beef is processed industrially. And because about 45 percent of cows and veal are reared and slaughtered by U.S. farmers, we tend to buy this meat from the same company and the same processing plant for about a third of our beef.So how is our beef really done? We have a long and distinguished history of eating traditional foods. We had steaks for centuries before burger chains began to serve them to us; we had fish and chips for centuries before McDonald's began to offer them; and we had beef ribs and the famous BBQ pork and beef brisket.The beef we eat now is a product of a process we still don't fully understand. To make our steak we don't just stick it between two pieces of beef; we have to get rid of all of the fat in the cow. We make it leaner by slaughtering it in the first place. The same is true of the pork we eat. We remove fat from the animal, and then we cook that meat until it becomes fatty and delicious, almost like well-done bacon.But the meat we are most familiar with is probably beef. The beef industry has been a major driver of the U.S. economy since the first settlers to the United States. More than 50 million people work in beef farms and slaughterhouses, and we buy the majority of our beef from them.A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting estimated the meat industry in the United States has generated $100 billion in economic activity, with more than half of that coming from the livestock industry. If every farm and slaughterhouse were instead to cut back to only 1.5 percent of the animals it currently processes, that would amount to about $1.75 billion in economic benefit. That doesn't even include the $1 billion in direct revenue for farmers each year.A more fundamental question is: is factory farming something we should be eating? After 20 years of factory farming, it turns out that the answer to that question is still "No."The first factory farms started in the late 1800s, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

There are only nine months left to get that flying car designed and in production. The Internet has reminded us of the very specific vision "Back to the Future II"  - and the fact that there still are no actual flying cars (at least without human passengers).The idea of a flying car of any kind (cars with wings or propellers) has been around for almost a century. It’s a concept that is very well known within our industry. What wasn’t known was the date and place. Back in the 1980s, there was a great idea that was brought forward by a guy who went by the name of “Venturi” and that turned out to be the first flying car. We have seen many, many other concepts that have followed over the years. The two we will focus on will be the Hummingbird and the “C-X” project.The key concept in all of the flying cars is that the engines and motor that make up the car are powered by something that actually moves in the air. The engine or motor is not a real rocket. The most exciting aspect of the flying cars is not that they operate in the air but that they are moving. The concept of a flying car is to make everything just about as simple as possible to move in the air. That means the only moving parts to worry about are the wheels, which only need to be able to operate in the air. Another big advantage is that since the car can hover in the air, then the engine and motor can be mounted on the ground. This keeps the weight of the car down to that of a regular vehicle, which makes the process easy.Hummingbird – Back in the 1970s, a brilliant idea called the Hummingbird was put forward. The Hummingbird has been the subject of many other flying car concepts including the C-X, the “Screamer,” and the “Carol.” But this concept was also a very good one because it had very practical aspects. The Hummingbird was a car that could be driven on the ground and that had a motor inside to move it in the air. The best part of the concept is that the motor and motor could be used either to take off or to land the car in the air in a very smooth manner. The Hummingbird was a great conceptual concept to use to make flying cars practical	0
A man believed to have been exposed to the deadly poison ricin in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Nevada, is out of his coma and is being questioned by authorities, FBI Special Agent David Staretz said Friday. Ricin, guns and an "anarchist-type textbook" were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel, police say. Staretz would not comment further on Roger Bergendorff, 57, who authorities said was taken to a hospital February 14 after complaining of breathing difficulties. He is listed in critical condition, said Naomi Jones, spokeswoman for Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas. Bergendorff, an artist who neighbors said had lived in his cousin's basement before moving to Las Vegas, was exposed to the poison in a Las Vegas extended-stay hotel, a law enforcement official said. The Riverton, Utah, home where Bergendorff previously lived belongs to Thomas Tholen, who along with his wife and daughter tested negative for ricin, according to authorities. That home and three storage areas in nearby West Jordan, Utah, were searched for ricin earlier this month and declared safe by authorities. A relative who went to Bergendorff's hotel room after he was sent to the hospital found the substance and alerted police February 27. Ricin is a poison that can be made from waste left over after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can come in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, the agency said. E-mail to a friend	1
More Japanese factories and businesses in China shuttered Tuesday as an East China Sea island dispute threatens to drag relations between Asia's two largest economies to their lowest point since World War II. Meanwhile, Baidu -- China's most popular search engine -- waded into the dispute by showing a cartoon image of the Chinese flag over the disputed island on its homepage. Clicking on the image revealed a page headlined "Diaoyu Island is China's!" The page had an interactive feature asking web users to place a virtual flag on a map of the islands. By 2:30 p.m. China time, nearly 2.7 million people had planted virtual flags, according to the site. Baidu is a public Chinese company traded on Nasdaq, and also operates a Japanese language search engine. However, the image was not posted to its Japanese website. "The real intent of this is to exhort people toward a more rational form of patriotism and show fact, and not fan flames of patriotic ardor," said Kaiser Kuo, director of international communication for Baidu. "We want people to be more rational in their patriotic outpouring ... planting a digital flag is a whole lot better than throwing rocks and smashing cars." In a note Tuesday, ratings agency Fitch warned that the credit ratings of Japanese auto and technology manufacturers could come under pressure "if the clash between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands escalates and is prolonged. Opinion: Politics by mob in China "A number of Japanese companies, including Panasonic, have temporarily suspended production at some of their Chinese facilities as anti-Japanese demonstrations demanding a boycott of their products flared across 85 cities in China at the weekend." Nissan, Mazda, Honda and Toyota suspended operations at some of their Chinese automotive plants, as have electronics makers Canon and Panasonic. Nearly 200 7-11 stores in Beijing and Chengdu, owned by Japanese company Seven & I Holdings, as well as 13 Ito Yokado supermarkets will be closed through Wednesday "to maintain the safety of employees," company spokesperson Katsuhiko Shimizu said.	1
One man more interested than most in what President Barack Obama will have to say in his address to the nation Wednesday night is al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. In his hideout somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan, Â an American drone would be an annoying interruption to his work,Â he said.ÂSo, he said, he has been keeping his distance from the president.Not a surprise, but a disappointment, considering their past history. He is, however, happy to give his take on what Obama has said in the past and what he might say.***President Obama’s speech will be his first opportunity to address the public on foreign policy. It will be his chance to make good on some campaign promises of cutting the deficit, of reforming immigration laws, of increasing the federal minimum wage and closing the prison-industrial complex.It will also be his chance to address a range of issues that will occupy him for much of the rest of his presidency. As president, he will have to consider questions about the war on Iraq, the war on terror and the role the U.S. military plays in American society. In his first address as commander in chief, he will have to explain his Iraq policy.ÂHe will be criticized for failing to do enough to stop the war in Iraq, for not doing enough to fight terror or to put the troops home. He will be criticized for his foreign policy of regime change in Iraq and Syria, for his lack of a war on Iran or Afghanistan.He will be criticized for not doing enough to keep U.S. borders open and for refusing to grant legal status to illegal aliens. He will be criticized for ignoring his base on issues like gay marriage. He will be criticized for not doing enough to fight the drug war.He will be criticized for his refusal to confront the reality of terrorism, and for allowing U.S. forces to be attacked and killed at home and abroad. He will be criticized for his leadership on climate change.He will be criticized for not being tough enough on Russia, for not being tough enough on China, and for not being tough enough on Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.What he will do not be a surprise to anyone who has followed his career. As the new speaker of the House, he will have to work with a Congress that is in no mood to challenge him.	0
Back in the pool for the first time since 2012, Michael Phelps was close to his peerless best. The most decorated Olympian of all time raced to a second-place finish in the 100m butterfly final in front of a sell-out crowd at the Skyline Aquatic Center, Arizona. Phelps came up two-tenths of a second short of an instant return to winning ways with a time of 51.93 seconds -- coming in just behind his longtime rival and friend Ryan Lochte. Phelps time ranks as the fourth fastest this year, and -- although two seconds slower than his own 49.82 world record -- the 28-year-old was satisfied. "I said I wanted to be around 52.0 and I would be completely happy with that," Phelps told ESPN, before reiterating that has future was still undecided. "It's one meet; it's one race. It's a long way whether I decide to continue or not." A 628-day wait The 1,200 people in attendance might have been a few less than the 17,000 he entertained at his last race -- the gold medal-winning 4x100 medley relay at the London Olympics -- but the 18-time Olympic gold medalist told reporters he hadn't felt so nervous about a race since he was a 10-year-old. Phelps retired after winning an unprecedented 22nd Olympic medal on 4 August 2012 and embarked on a year of travel and golfing with little mention of a return to swimming. But Phelps sparked speculation about a potential comeback by re-entering the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's testing program last November -- which began a nine-month wait required before a swimmer can again compete. Taking to the pool in competition for the first time in 628 days, he had cruised through his qualifying heat with the fastest time of 52.84 seconds, just ahead of Lochte who went on to win the final in the second fastest time in the world this year. "I probably wouldn't have gone that time if Phelps wasn't in that pool with me. We push each other all the time," said Lochte. "Down there at the turn I kind of peeked over and I saw him and almost started smiling," Lochte said, at which point, Phelps interjected: "Why? Because you were ahead?" The future	1

Named in 1999 as the male "athlete of the century" by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Carl Lewis embodied the Olympic motto -- "Citius, altius, fortius" (Faster, higher, stronger). Lewis  was the first black athlete to reach the 100-meter track hurdles -- where he improved his personal best time by 15 seconds at the Olympic trials -- and the first black athlete to win an Olympic medal -- the 100-meter dash, in Berlin in Berlin on July 13, 1936. He was also the first athlete to run in the 400-meter dash as well as in the 5,000-meter run (his gold-medal time in the gold-medal race in 1936 was 4:19:37).Lewis was raised in rural Mississippi near Greenwood, a town he referred to as the cradle of his sporting career. He was the grandson of a sharecropper, and as a boy, he was so poor that his family did not have enough money to afford the horsemeat his family ate at Easter. As a young man, Lewis was a member of the American Expeditionary Force in France during World War I, and he was awarded the Army's Distinguished Service Medal. When Lewis was 19, he had an accident in which he suffered a head injury and the loss of part of one of his eyes. He continued to play sports, however, and made his national team debut in football in 1916. Lewis was later given a scholarship to the University of Mississippi to pursue his love of athletics. In that same year he became the first black student to join Kappa Alpha Psi (Kappa Alpha Society), and in 1919 he graduated with a business degree.After receiving his law degree Lewis began his legal career. In 1924, he received an offer from the University of Southern California, but he was afraid that after graduating he would be unemployed due to his lack of credentials. At that time, blacks were not allowed to receive degrees from institutions outside of the South. He went on to a career as an attorney in Los Angeles for over 30 years. Lewis served as head of the University of Southern California Sports Association for 22 years, and as a member of its board of directors from 1943-1953. Lewis was also the first black attorney to join UCLA's law school. He also served as an assistant U.S. attorney under President John F. Kennedy in Los Angeles, and was appointed by President Lyndon B	0
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been frozen in the public mind by four images. There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them. There's the one of a blood-smeared Tsarnaev staggering from beneath a tarp on a trailered boat as a small army of law enforcement holds him in its sights. That ended the pursuit that began when the FBI handed out the first picture. Then there's the gauzy image of a placid, tousle-haired teenager that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone three months later. That one sparked outrage among many of the survivors and prompted numerous outlets to pull the issue, which featured a lengthy profile of the suspect. And there's the one from his last public appearance -- a sketch of Tsarnaev in an orange jumpsuit standing in a courtroom, repeating "not guilty" to the litany of charges against him. As the dignitaries and the survivors and the rescuers gathered in Boston on Tuesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of the bombing, Tsarnaev was sitting in a cell on a former Army installation about 35 miles away. He's scheduled to go to trial in early November, when prosecutors will ask a jury to put him on death row. His lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that Tsarnaev, now 20, was under the "domination and control" of his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in the chase. His defense team is led by a lawyer known for cutting deals to spare the lives of her most notorious clients. But they're facing long odds, said New York lawyer Ronald Tabak, a leading expert on capital cases. "They're up against the huge amount of pretrial publicity, the negative nature of most of that publicity and the fact that this was a crime that affected the entire area," he said. Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, "They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism," Tabak said.	1
Police are investigating reports that Zahra Baker, the 10-year-old disabled girl who was killed in North Carolina, may have been raped prior to her death, according to police search warrants that were unsealed Tuesday. The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, reported Zahra missing on October 9. Police announced that they found the girl's remains on November 11. She had been dismembered. Search warrants obtained by the Hickory, North Carolina, police released Tuesday, give the first glimpse into the grisly events that could have led to the death of the freckled-face girl, who lost part of her left leg at age 5 to cancer. According to one of the search warrants, a tipster told police that Zahra had been at a North Carolina home with two men and one of the men said "he had done something very bad and needed to leave town." One of the men was associated with Zahra's stepmother but was not Zahra's father, the tipster said. The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said. The tipster told police that he got the information about the alleged rape from a friend who was told about it from his sister. Police went to the home to see if they could confirm the fourth-hand information and found a mattress at the side of the house that "had a large dark stain in the middle," the search warrant said. The tipster said the men did not admit to killing the girl but did say that they "might have hit her in the head," the search warrant said. Police were also told by an attorney for Elisa Baker that the girl was dismembered. In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for "latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered." They also were searching for "white trash bags used to store body parts," the warrant said. In that warrant, police were seeking to search the Hickory home that Zahra lived in with her stepmother and father Adam Troy Baker. No one has been charged in the girl's death. Elisa Baker has been arrested on an obstruction charge after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory.	1
Lawyers for New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez have until Friday to respond to a letter from the Major League Baseball Players Association seeking a dismissal of Rodriguez's lawsuit claiming the union did not adequately represent him. The lawsuit stems from Rodriguez's recent 162-game steroid suspension and his efforts to get a Manhattan federal court to throw out the record-setting penalty. The players union, which represented Rodriguez in his arbitration proceeding, claims in the letter that the "union's forceful advocacy" was demonstrated by the reduction of his suspension from the 211 games sought by MLB, among other things. In a four-page letter addressed to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, dated Thursday, the union asked the court to throw out the claim against the union because Rodriguez "does not allege facts sufficient to overturn the [Arbitration] Award" and failed to provide evidence of a breach of the union's duties in representing him. A spokesman for Rodriguez, Ron Berkowitz, declined to comment Tuesday. In a federal lawsuit filed Jan. 13, Rodriguez accused the players union of acting in "bad faith" in representing him during the arbitration process. Rodriguez filed the lawsuit in New York's Southern District court against Major League Baseball and the union in an effort to get back on the field next season. The players union has denied that allegation. A pre-motion conference is set for February 14, and Rodriguez's lawyers were ordered to respond to the union's letter one week before. CNN sought comment from Rodriguez's lawyers but has not received a response. The suspension will not only cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary, but it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who'll turn 40 in the 2015 season. Rodriguez, one of 14 players suspended in the Biogenesis scandal, was the only one who appealed his suspension. Though he was suspended in August, Rodriguez played out the 2013 season because of the appeal. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six homers behind Willie Mays. Rodriguez has claimed he was the target of a MLB "witch hunt."	1
Clear skies allowed for more evacuations and rescues in flood-devastated Colorado on Friday, but the forecast through Sunday called for more heavy rain. Even after the last of the storms, authorities can't say how long it will take to reach residents who will remain isolated by devastated roads. The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said. Authorities already had recovered the body of a man who left the same car and tried to save the woman. One other death had been reported in Boulder County and one occurred in El Paso County. President Barack Obama declared an emergency for Boulder, Larimer and El Paso counties, FEMA announced Friday. The declaration allowed FEMA to bring in four rescue teams, the largest ever deployment in Colorado, officials said. More heavy rain is forecast through Sunday for the region, on top of the 15 inches some parts of the state have already received. "This isn't over," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. On Friday, National Guard troops using "high-profile" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night. "It just really felt like God came down and saved us. It felt great," Melinda Villa said of the National Guard's arrival at the Lyons apartment where she was stranded with her 1-month-old infant. She said, "I just felt like I was trapped. No phone, no water, barely any formula for my baby, barely any food for us." Jonathan Linenberger described a Noah's Ark-style evacuation as he, his fiancee and four dogs and three cats greeted the National Guard truck. "We had to go (through) knee-deep water, at least. We had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there," said Linenberger. "That was the first thing you can grab, your loved ones -- and that's what we have." The National Guard also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of Jamestown by helicopter, CNN affiliate KCNC-TV reported. Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said. The sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads.	1
When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago, Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television. "I was so happy,"  she recalls. "I felt like I had my life back, like we had our lives back. . . . The people in the audience were saying it's 'the great repeal.' "The vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was close. It was 4 to 3, and to her horror, Walters and her husband heard from two members of the Senate Finance Committee who had come up short that their proposal to cut Medicare costs "will just increase the numbers of young, healthy people who are unable to buy insurance while reducing the number of people with more severe illnesses and higher treatment costs."The first and only time that the Walterses heard that kind of language coming from Congress was when Senator Edward Kennedy told them about the way he had taken over the reins at a Democratic fund-raising dinner in Washington. He told the crowd, "This is a once in a lifetime chance to save the nation's health care system," and he went on to explain that "this is one of the most important, if not _the_ most important, issues that we face."With the full House voting to pass and the Senate voting to pass, President Obama signed the legislation into law. The Walterses cheered. But it was a bittersweet night for them. They had lost not only their insurance, but their insurance for one of their two children. Even before the vote, the Walterses were in shock. Now it seemed as if all their lives had been about that moment.As the Walterses watched the news reports, they knew what happened next. Senator Ted Kennedy was on the show again. He was going to make the Walterses' lives miserable if they didn't vote against health care reform."Why can't we just buy a plan?" Walters recalls being asked by the radio host. She was stunned. "Why can't we just buy a plan?" she thought to herself. "What happened to her? Why can't we just buy a plan?" As she looked herself over before she went to bed that night, Walters saw a little girl with long blond hair and blue eyes. She didn't recognize her on the news. This woman was staring down the barrel of a gun. "If I don't take care of this,	0
and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day. The scene was apparently different at the two press screenings earlier in the day, after which many critics were eager to pour out their abhorrence -- not at the movie's sado-masochistic sex scenes but to the causes of greater offense in the critical mind  -- script, plot and performance. Some traumatized refugees of these screenings stood alongside me at the red carpet outside Berlin's swanky Zoo Palast cinema, awaiting the arrival of the stars for the film's international premiere. Their sense of outrage had not been cooled by the chilly evening air. "It was Fifty Shades of sh*t!" exclaimed one appalled journalist. But on the other side of the carpet a different story was playing out. Several hundred fans huddled together for warmth, spurred on by a shared devotion to the books of E.L. James and the anticipation of catching an eyeful of Jamie Dornan, the handsome actor who plays her bondage-loving billionaire, Christian Grey. They had come from Germany, of course, but as far afield as the United States. A man from Uruguay was in attendance with his wife and daughter. Had he read the book? "I read some of it," he told me rather sheepishly, "but then I gave it back to my wife. She loves it and my daughter does too." Male opinion was relatively hard to find among a crowd in which women outnumbered men by about 20-1. Some fans had come along as couples, revealing different approaches to "Fifty Shades." "I'm Fifty Shades of sex," offered a young German man, to which his girlfriend countered: "And I am Fifty Shades of romance." Meanwhile, a few hundred miles away in the UK, London firefighters are anticipating an increase in call-outs when the film hits general release in a few days. London Fire Brigade says it is "concerned" that the event could lead to a "spike" in people being trapped in handcuffs or genital rings. Pandemonium broke out when the stars arrived, as fans went into ecstasy at first sight of their heroes. The camera crews and reporters bawled out equally hysterically, not in delight but frustration as the enormous entourage of minders and PR managers accompanying the cast obscured all but a glimpse of them. Scuffles broke out between camera crews defending their inadequately-allocated space.	1
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, commonly known as the swine flu, the Associated Press reported today, citing Arias' office. It was reported late Friday that Arias had been diagnosed with an H1N1 virus, also known as the swine flu, which is highly contagious among human beings and can cause severe complications including pneumonia, bronchitis and severe ear infections among young children. The virus also creates a risk of death among the elderly. The president's office told the AP the diagnosis was only made Friday and was made available only to officials at his office.Officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed Arias was diagnosed Saturday with the swine flu.The swine flu virus was first identified in Mexico in mid-December. It spread rapidly from Mexico to other countries, including the United States and Canada, in February. As of Friday, two Americans in Mexico and three in Canada have had their swine flu antibodies detected in their blood.No deaths among Americans have been reported from swine flu, but nine swine flu cases have been confirmed among Americans. At least five deaths have been reported worldwide.The H1N1 flu virus has produced an estimated 50 million additional cases of illness worldwide in the past month, the CDC reported. Health officials estimated that nearly 3,000 die annually as a result of H1N1. The virus has also killed a total of 5 million to 7 million people.The CDC said the most dangerous form of the H1N1 virus is the swine flu. "This is the most widely spread form of influenza," the CDC said in a fact sheet on the virus. "The only way to identify this form of H1N1 is through testing. Testing will determine whether the virus is H1N1 or another strain."The CDC noted that the public is not to worry about the virus, but it said the H1N1 virus can be passed from human to human and from animal to animal.In a statement, Arias said he is awaiting a response from the CDC. "I am taking this matter seriously. I will keep you all informed."The World Health Organization said the swine flu virus is not harmful to humans. The CDC said the public should not panic.In his statement to the AP, Arias said many	0
Their faces and darker skins make them look different. They are routinely called "slave" by the majority, whatever their profession. But Iraq's black population hopes that Barack Obama's rise to the White House will mark a turning point for minorities not just in the United States, but also in their country. Jalal Thiyab Thijeel quotes Barack Obama, saying it is time for "change." Jalal Thiyab Thijeel, general secretary of the "Movement of Free Iraqis," followed every detail of Obama's election campaign. "Inspiring," he calls it. Inspiring politically, and personally. Like Obama, Thijeel has family roots in Africa. "We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world," he recalls. "We're going to make him a model to follow. Even our old women were praying for him to win." When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party. It was a moment, he tells me as we talk on a street in Baghdad, that he'll never forget. "Now we, the dark-skinned people, feel even closer to the American people because Obama is one of us." Thijeel's organization estimates there are approximately 2 million black Iraqis. The country's total population is more than 28 million, most of them ethnic Arabs. It's impossible to verify Thijeel's estimate, since the government does not keep statistics on race, but there is no denying there are many black Iraqis in the southern city of Basra. Their history goes back 1,000 years to the time when Africans were brought as slaves to the south of Iraq to drain marshes and build Basra. Many Iraqis still call blacks "abed," an Arabic word that means "slave." Thijeel grimaces when he pronounces it. It's demeaning, he says, and he wants the government to forbid its use. Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is. "I never want my son to go through this," he says.

Find time for yourself this holiday season to settle in with one of these five recommended reads. The Scrapbook of Frankie Pratt By Caroline Preston In her whimsical mash-up of historical fiction and scrapbooking, Caroline Preston uses vintage images and artifacts, paper ephemera and flapper-era souvenirs, to enhance a narrative it appears she pecked out on a manual Corona typewriter. Apparently no junk shop or eBay seller was spared in Preston's search for ways to bring her fictional heroine to life in "The Scrapbook of Frankie Pratt." The novel, designed as a memory album, takes Frankie from girlhood in small-town New Hampshire -- cue family photos, magazine biscuit recipes, freckle-cream ads, and an untoward relationship with an older man -- on to graduation from Vassar in 1924. From there, the aspiring writer goes forth into Greenwich Village bohemia and expat adventures in Paris, including an illicit love affair, progressive political associations, flowering feminism, and encounters with famous folk like Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce.

The chilling acts the 15-year-old boy is accused of defy imagination: Pumping his mother, brother and two younger sisters with bullets. Gunning down his dad when he returned home. Texting a picture of his lifeless mother to his 12-year-old girlfriend. Plotting to kill strangers outside a supermarket. But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster. They can't fathom what could have gone so terribly wrong. "Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue, we can't be sure yet," his uncle, former New Mexico state Sen. Eric Griego, said. "What we do know is that none of us, even in our wildest nightmare, could have imagined that he could do something like this." The family statement describes the boy as a gifted athlete and musician who was active in youth services at church. It said the teen accompanied his father on mission trips to Mexico and wanted to continue a long family history of military service by becoming a soldier. The family disputed any media characterization that the teen was a loner and said he had many friends and was a wrestler in state tournaments. His father was a champion wrestler and coach. The family also said they did not want anyone to use the case in the nation's unfolding debate about guns. "To be clear, our family has differing views on gun rights and gun control. What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said. "We ask those in the media and those who would use the media to make their political case, to not use Nehemiah as a pawn for ratings or to score political points. He is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever." But authorities painted a far different picture of the teen. Sheriff: Teen planned shootings for at least a week Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston said Griego was "involved heavily" with violent video games and that he "was quite excited as he got the opportunity to discuss that with our investigators."	1
More than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed since the start of Saudi-led military operations against Yemeni Shia fighters, a Saudi Defense Ministry official said Ã¢â¬Â¦ On Saturday, May 23, the Saudi-led coalition began targeting Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh on all fronts in the country. Ã¢â¬Â¦ The coalition hit targets in Aden, Taiz and Ma’rib, the official announced on Sunday, May 24. Ã¢â¬Â¦ The coalition is in an offensive to protect civilians.A war monitor, the Saudi-based Institute for the Study of War, reported that over 1,500 fighters had died Ã¢â¬Â¦ “Since the start of Saudi operations, Ã¢â¬Â¦ the Saudi-led coalition has conducted a significant number of air raids, hitting targets in Taiz, Sanaa, Aden and Ma’rib,” Brig. Gen. Ahmed al-Asiri, the head of the coalition’s operations, said in a statement on Sunday by the Ministry of Defense. Ã¢â¬Â¦ Ã¢â¬Â¦ The Houthis are heavily armed, with more than 1,000 to 2,000 fighters, according to reports.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday that "Russia should not intervene in Ukraine under the guise of humanitarian convoys or any other pretext of 'peacekeeping,'" according to a senior State Department official. Kerry urged "all parties to work through international organizations" to provide humanitarian assistance in eastern Ukraine, the official said. In a separate call Saturday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko agreed that any Russian action in Ukraine, even for purported "humanitarian" purposes, without the formal, express consent and authorization of the Ukraine government would be "unacceptable and a violation of international law," according to the White House. Russia has denied allegations that it is supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis there. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another: increasing troop levels along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. Pro-Russian separatists say 'fight to the death' Despite claims by Ukrainian officials, the pro-Russian separtists hold firm that Ukrainian forces "have never been able to take over the Donetsk districts" -- the hotbed of violence in eastern Ukraine. The self-proclaimed leader of the Donetsk people's republic said on Saturday that pro-Russian separatists would consider a humanitarian cease-fire to bring aid to civilians but they are not ready to surrender their territory and would "fight to the death." "We are ready for ceasefire to avoid escalation of the humanitarian disaster in Donbass," Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic in a statement, said, referring to the populous region that includes Donetsk. Earlie this month, The United States and European Union increased economic sanctions on Moscow for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia.

Bras can do miraculous things these days (thank you underwire). But can they detect cancer? That's the claim for First Warning Systems new bra, equipped with a series of sensors embedded in the cups that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue and, says the Reno, Nev.-based company, provide a thermal fingerprint that can alert doctors to the presence of malignant cells. According to the company's website, the data generated by the sports bra can predict the presence of breast cancer with 90% specificity and sensitivity. Women wear it for 12 hours to accumulate a stable enough reading of temperature, and the measurements are fed into the company's algorithm that then spits out a result: normal, benign, suspected for breast tissue abnormalities, or probable for breast tissue abnormalities. Sounds like a good idea, right? Except that the concept of using temperature to detect disease may not be ready for prime time just yet. "Hypothetically, it's conceivable that malignant processes would have a temperature gradient compared to non-malignant tissues," says Dr. Therese Bevers, medical director of the cancer prevention center at the Univ. of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. "But that gradient may not be very large." (MORE: A Fashionable Fitâ€”high-tech athletic gear) The idea of using thermograms to ferret out abnormally growing cells is already being used with an imaging device that takes a temperature reading of breast tissue. Tumors need nutrients to grow, and they start to siphon these off from their own blood supply, which they start to build as they amass more and more abnormally growing cells. All of this metabolic work generates heat, and it's this temperature change that thermograms â€” and the First Warning bra's sensors â€” are designed to pick up. But when these profiles, which show "hot" and "cold" spots that are supposed to correlate to cancerous and non-malignant tissue, respectively, are compared to mammogram, MRI and ultrasound tests, their findings don't always match up. "We see some thermograms come back as abnormal, and we do all kinds of imaging with mammogram, ultrasound and MRI and we follow the women and nothing develops," says Bevers. "And we have women with breast cancers that are not seen on the thermograms.	1
Remember the obnoxious guy in the early-'80s Mr. Microphone commercial? While cruising in a convertible with his friends, he uses the old Ronco toy to come on to a pedestrian. "Hey, good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later!" he yells. Smooth move, Ex-Lax. This is not the way you approach a woman on the street. That point was brought home this week with a video posted by Rob Bliss on behalf of the anti-street-harassment group Hollaback! Bliss, inspired by the experiences of his girlfriend, tracked a volunteer, Shoshana B. Roberts, as she walked through New York over the course of 10 hours. What 10 hours of street harassment in NYC looks like Over the course of the video, men offer Roberts greetings such as "Damn!", "Hey baby," "What's up, beautiful?" and "Sexy." A few men follow her for blocks. Others seem offended that she doesn't respond. The reaction on the Internet has ranged from perplexity to outright anger. "Unless one of these guys physical assaults you then they have every right especially if you don't tell them to leave you alone. It doesn't f****** matter if it's scary or if it offends people," wrote one commenter on the video's YouTube page. "I call bullsh*t. New wave feminazi persecution complex professional victim bullsh*t," added another. On a Reddit thread about the video, one person asked, "If a guy can't open a conversation with 'How are you doing today?' then what is he supposed to open it with?" Good question. Being a nuisance There can be a fine line between flirtation and harassment, and it's been used for comic effect in movies and television shows. "Has anyone ever told you that you have the face of a Botticelli and the body of a Degas?" asked Robert Downey Jr. in the 1987 movie "The Pick-Up Artist." Sure, there are men and women who sometimes do want a quick fling with a passer-by. For them, maybe come-ons and catcalls work.	1
I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education. The struggle for integration has shaped my life from the very beginning. When my father, an art professor at Florida A&M University, sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University, the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student. In 1957, he completed his degree at Penn State, and in 1958 became the first African-American professor at Bridgewater State College, now Bridgewater State University, in Massachusetts, where I grew up. My parents were part of the great migration, moving to the North to escape segregation. They achieved their goal. My three siblings and I attended predominantly white public schools in our small Massachusetts town without protest or high court drama, and graduated well-prepared for the colleges we all attended. Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration. Eventually our sons, and even my parents, moved to Atlanta, too. They returned to a region very different than the one they remembered. Fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, their choice of housing and their freedom of movement are unencumbered by race. But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines. And not just in the South, but across the United States. Schools are more segregated today than in the 1980s, according to a new report released by researchers at UCLA's Civil Rights Project, "Brown at 60: Great Progress, a Long Retreat and Uncertain Future." This is the result of continued patterns of residential segregation, and a series of Supreme Court decisions that have quietly undermined the implementation of Brown through a shift away from court-ordered busing and other mandated desegregation strategies. As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had. Particularly for young white children, interaction with people of color is likely to be a virtual reality rather than an actual one, with media images (often negative ones) most clearly shaping their attitudes and perceived knowledge of communities of color.	1
Five people have been killed after one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes spewed a giant cloud of ash and rocks early Tuesday. They were climbing on Mount Mayon, some 212 miles (340 km) southeast of Manila, when the blast occurred at around 8 a.m. local time, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Of the five fatalities, four were German tourists, while the other was identified as Jerome Berin, their Filipino guide, the NDRRMC said. Joey Salceda, governor of Albay Province, told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN they were killed after being hit by falling rocks. He said they were part of a larger group scaling the volcano. Seven others, including an Australian, were hurt. The NDRRMC said a total of 27 hikers were on the volcano at the time and requested assistance. iReport: Volcano sends ash soaring into sky According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the blast sent a thick column of ash 500 meters (1,600 feet) into the air -- the result of what it called a "small phreatic event" that lasted about 73 seconds. While no intensification of volcanic activity was observed, it warned that these sudden ash and steam explosions could occur at any time. Therefore officials advised people against going inside a six-kilometer danger zone around the volcano. Mount Mayon is the most volatile of more than 50 volcanoes -- 22 of which are considered active -- that are scattered across the Philippine archipelago. An almost perfect cone shape, Mayon last erupted in 2010 and forced thousands of people to flee from their homes. Mayon's slopes, like many volcanoes in the country, are home to thousands of farming communities who make use of the fertile soils provided by the volcanic activity despite the occasional risk of eruption.	1
A 30-year-old California woman was abducted from a male acquaintance's residence in the Bay Area and is being held for ransom, police said Tuesday. The male acquaintance, also 30, iced, cuffed, and gagged before being released around 11:46 p.m., according to police scanner reports. The man and woman were found together hours later, police said.The man, a member of a motorcycle gang whose gang members terrorized people in Sacramento and the Bay Area, got into an argument with her, police said. He had called the police to say that the woman was armed with a knife, and police did not immediately find a weapon."When officers arrived on scene, he was hiding behind a couch inside a home. When officers found him, he was unzipped, lying on his stomach, with his hands cuffed behind his back," according to the police report. "Officers found a large knife blade in the center of his chest and the tip of the blade was sticking through the shirt he was wearing."The woman also had a rope around her neck and was being held by police. She had been strangled and duct taped in her bed, the police report said.This is the latest in a string of cases where a gang member has gone on a killing spree:•A 22-year-old man was killed by San Mateo County sheriff's deputies in the driveway of his home early Sunday after deputies responded to a domestic dispute call.The man was involved in a fight with his sister-in-law earlier in the day. He told deputies he killed her husband after the man attacked him. The man, who suffered multiple stab wounds, died at a hospital, San Mateo County sheriff's Lt. Dave Hernandez said.•A 24-year-old man was shot to death by sheriff's deputies in the parking lot of the Apple Store in Saratoga.The man was walking with two friends in the parking lot around 2:30 p.m. when he was approached by three deputies, who were trying to pull them over on suspicion of driving without headlights. They asked the man where he was coming from, and he told them he was going to his home, Hernandez said.The man was then shot in the chest and killed, authorities said.

Donning her signature red updo and red lipstick and polka-dotted dress, 915 Lucy Ricardo look-alikes gathered in Jamestown, New York, on Saturday, setting a record for the most Lucys in one place at one time. Setting the "Lucy" record was just one part of a weekend's worth of events celebrating the comedienne and star of the "I Love Lucy" show's 100th birthday. Especially this year, "we've really tried to stay true to (Lucy's) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend," said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy. Joan Rivers and Paula Poundstone were two of the headlining comics scheduled to perform over the event of several days in Jamestown, which also included a parade, a showcase for amateur comics and a performance by the Story Pirates sketch comedy group for kids. Now in its 20th year, The Lucille Ball Festival of Comedy draws diehard Lucy fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as Australia, Britain, Canada and Japan to tour the Lucy-Desi museum and Desilu Playhouse, two of the attractions at the Center. Instead of simply maintaining the grounds for idol worship, though, Gunderson said her goal is to create a festival that will offer "new and contemporary comedy for years to come." Gunderson's vision for the festival is one that she hopes will reflect the successful, progressive and still-relevant career that Lucy created. "She was the first woman to ever be pregnant on television," Gunderson said. "Lucy was the first female head of a Hollywood studio." And in her comedy, "she found a way to be clean, but still edgy." She remained "independent of societal standards." Lucy Fest has always been a weekend to celebrate Lucy's contributions to comedy on what would have been her birthday. But in honor of her 100th birthday, Gunderson said a concerted marketing effort including social media was launched, and she expected anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 people to participate in the festival. The increased presence will hopefully kick-start the "programmatic expansion into truly being a center for comedy," she said. The festival is one of the four pillars in the center's plan to stay more true to Lucy's vision.	1
The big winners of this Formula One season could be road drivers rather than F1 racers, according to one former world champion. Jody Scheckter, who took the drivers' title in 1979, hopes a raft of technological changes -- notably smaller, hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency -- will help improve road cars' performance. "It's very positive for the sport, this is the first time you've seen the sport bring in regulations that really push the envelope of technology for every type of car," the South African told CNN. "They are trying to take efficiency from everywhere they can on a car." This year's race cars will boast an enhanced Energy Recovery System (ERS) and 1.6-liter V6 engines, compared to the 2.4-liter V8s on show last year. The ERS uses heat generated when braking and thermal energy from exhaust gases to create extra power. The Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) has been used in F1 since 2009, but Scheckter says these latest advancements in the sport will only benefit everyday drivers. "Wherever there is heat, they turn that into energy," added the former Ferrari driver. "From that point of view, that's what road cars are becoming more and more. "They've taken this energy from the brakes and these different areas, that's what Formula One has done to a much higher degree than I've ever seen before. I think the technology will flow to road cars very quickly. "It's very important for the global environment that they can make the technology work practically and then it can move into road cars." On the track, Scheckter expects an unpredictable start to the championship as teams and drivers wrestle with the new regulations. An encouraging preseason for Mercedes has fueled talk that Lewis Hamilton is the favorite for this weekend's Australian Grand Prix and in pole position to take the title. Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in Bahrain, but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by Felipe Massa of Williams. The Brazilian is a new arrival at the British team following nine years with Ferrari and Scheckter expects Massa and Hamilton to start well, but he stopped short of tipping either to be top of the pile at the end of the season.	1
Before two pirate leaders departed the captured yacht where they held four Americans earlier this month, a maritime source says they left instructions: Kill the hostages if we do not come back from negotiations. U.S. officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices, the maritime source said. The four Americans were later killed, but it is not clear why. Also not clear is when during the negotiations -- or why -- the Americans detained the two pirate negotiators. The pirates' detention goes against standard negotiating practices, as the pirates came in good faith to make a deal to hand over the hostages, said the maritime source, who was briefed on the incident and has connections to British intelligence officials. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. U.S. Central Command declined to comment on whether officials detained the pirates and said the FBI and the Justice Department have the lead in the case. The Justice Department had no comment Sunday. On Friday, the FBI said there was no comment due to the continuing investigation. However, a U.S. government official told CNN the talks with the two pirate negotiators faltered when it was determined the men "had no authority to negotiate anything." American officials then took the men into custody rather then let them return to the yacht, the U.S. official said. "It would be unfathomable to have put them back on the boat where they might have done harm to the hostages," the official said, disagreeing with a published report that the detention of two fellow pirates might have upset those still aboard the captured yacht -- named the Quest -- who were holding four Americans. "There was no change in mood, no escalation" and gunfire broke out on the Quest more than eight hours later, the U.S. official said. The official took issue with a New York Times report that said the FBI's hostage negotiator aboard the USS Sterett decided the two Somalis were not serious about resolving the matter, which led U.S. officials to take the two men into custody and ask for a new representative from the pirates. According to the the U.S. official,  who was not authorized to discuss the Quest hijacking on the record, the issue was not whether the two pirates were serious about negotiating, but that they lacked the power to cut a deal.	1
A 47-year-old charity worker who says she has never been kissed is now a YouTube sensation after a singing performance that wowed the notoriously harsh talent judge Simon Cowell. The YouTube video of Susan Boyle's ute-driving talent show audition performance has become a hit, with more than one million views as of Wednesday morning. The video was posted Wednesday on YouTube as a "try it for yourself" video to Cowell's "Your Song" audition show. "We'll sing a song at the end and see what happens," Cowell said in the video of the audition."I was asked to sing, and I found it really weird," she said on camera in 2005.Award-winning singer Susan Boyle, 51, of Northallerton, United Kingdom, appeared on the ITV talent show in February 2005.She had come to audition for Simon Cowell, a legendary music and entertainment executive. Cowell had never seen her before, but Boyle's mother, who took her to the audition, says she had seen her on a TV show, British TV's I'll Teach You to Be a Millionaire. She says her daughter was singing during the audition. "What she did with her eyes was really moving," says the mother, who has since come to find the video "a bit creepy." The mother told the BBC she did not know her daughter would be a YouTube star. "I am not a fan, and I never said she was, and I don't know anything about her, and she made her choice," she says. "I don't know why she was on the show."Boyle's mother says she was shocked when she heard about her daughter's fame. "It is very upsetting because my daughter has a wonderful life and she is so kind and gentle and I was very proud of her," says the mother. "I really don't know why she did it," she says. Her mother has posted a copy of the audition on YouTube, and says she hopes people will do a search for Susan Boyle to learn more about her, to "show that we are not all evil."Boyle, a married mother of four, sings a cover of "I Will Survive," a British patriotic song, as part of the audition. A quick-witted, no-nonsense American, she made headlines worldwide for wearing a yellow ribbon in the 2005 UK general election. She was awarded a star	0
The director of Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday defended giving away an estimated $85 million in hurricane relief supplies, blaming Louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles. A New Orleans charity keeps goods in trash bags in an empty church. FEMA never told it about the free items. "We still have quite a few left if Louisiana needs those," David Paulison said. "But we did find out, we did ask Louisiana, 'Do you want these?' They said, 'No, we don't need them.' So we offered them to the other states." A CNN investigation revealed last week that FEMA gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. The material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including Louisiana, where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed. Paulison told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer" his agency distributed more than 90,000 "living kits" to people in Louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by Katrina. The kits included cleaning supplies, mops, brooms, pots and pans. After CNN reported on the giveaway, Louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state, which originally passed on them. John Medica, director of the Louisiana's Federal Property Assistance Agency, told CNN he was unaware Katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, an outspoken critic of FEMA's response to the hurricane, told CNN the supply giveaway was "just a shame." "It's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy," said Landrieu, who wrote Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff last week to request an explanation. "We're still trying to fix it. It's going to take a lot more work." Paulison said much of the stockpile included "things we don't normally store -- refrigerators, stoves, coolers, diapers, things like that." States, meanwhile, were requesting those items, he said. "It didn't make any sense for FEMA to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally don't even keep. We have plenty of supplies in place if we have another disaster. We can duplicate that type of commodities and get them for people in need," he said. The agency's chief spokesman, James McIntyre, had declined a request for an on-camera interview and told CNN the giveaway was "not news."	1
Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them. The room was pitch-black inside. Jackie blindly turned toward Drew, uttering his name. At that same moment, she says, she detected movement in the room -- and felt someone bump into her. Jackie began to scream. -- "A Rape on Campus," Rolling Stone The above scene is just the beginning. In the paragraphs that follow, writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely gives excruciatingly painful details of what allegedly happened to Jackie, a freshman at the University of Virginia, over the course of the next three hours as she was allegedly gang-raped by members of Drew's fraternity. "Grab its motherf***ing leg," one guy in the crowd said. "Its." Jackie was dehumanized in every sense imaginable. According to Rolling Stone, after a classmate penetrated Jackie with a beer bottle, she passed out. She woke up at 3 a.m., alone, her face beaten, her dress torn and spattered with blood. Going barefoot down the stairs, past the frat party still in full swing, Jackie left the building and called her friends. And this, if you can imagine it, is where the story gets worse. Opinion: Punish rapists, not fraternities The article continues: Jackie's friends, two guys and one woman, ultimately decided she shouldn't be taken to the hospital or report the rape because if she did, "her reputation will be shot for the next four years." Jackie's female friend insisted, "She's gonna be the girl who cried 'rape,' and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again." This reaction is fairly unique to rape as compared with other crimes. After all, if someone is mugged or murdered, such crimes are generally reported to the police. For instance, the federal government estimates that 65% of rape or sexual assault cases are unreported, while 17% of car thefts are unreported. On the day the Rolling Stone article about Jackie's alleged rape was published, Caitlin Kelly, a Web producer at The New Yorker, wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape. "'I think that guy I know stole my wallet,'" Kelly tweeted, followed by the hypothetical responses: "Well, do you have proof? Were you drinking that night? What were you wearing when this happened?"	1
Polygamist leader Warren Jeffs is not only running the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but he has also ousted at least 45 high-ranking members he considered a threat to his leadership, two well-placed sources tell CNN. Those who have been kicked out of the church -- all men -- are not allowed to return to their wives or children, the sources said. Jeffs, scheduled to go to trial this year on sexual assault and bigamy charges, is running the affairs of the church from his jail cell in Texas, the sources said. Jeffs gave up control of the splinter sect that advocates plural marriages, including marriages that involve girls younger than 18, after he was convicted in 2007 of rape as accomplice. That conviction was overturned last year. Sources within the church tell CNN that the man who replaced Jeffs as business head of the church, Wendell Nielsen, has been removed and that Jeffs has signed documents retaking control of FLDS. Also removed are Willie Jessup, Jeffs' one-time bodyguard who served as the spokesman for the church after a raid on its Texas compound; and David Zitting, the mayor of Hildale, Utah, a town in which the population consists almost entirely of members of the church. The FLDS splintered from the Mormon Church more than a century ago when Mormons renounced the practice of polygamy. Jeffs' church is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Critics of the FLDS say underage girls are forced into "spiritual" plural marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied sexual abuse. Texas prosecutors filed charges against Jeffs in 2008 after authorites raided the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch in El Dorado, Texas. They removed 400 children. Authorities feared they had been sexually abused. While some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse, most of the children were later returned to their families. Jeffs was eventually extradited from Utah to Texas. He was arraigned on the Texas charges in December in Tom Green County.	1
On October 9, a Pakistani schoolgirl who dared to speak out against the Taliban took a bullet to the head for her act of defiance. Now, as Malala Yousufzai lies in a hospital bed in Birmingham, England, the shock and outrage among her countrymen have given way to a new sentiment: What will the government do about this? While the Pakistani news media debate how the country should respond to the attack, thousands of people nationwide have joined in rallies in support of the wounded 14-year-old. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid The shooting has prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger among many Pakistanis, analysts say. "There is a groundswell of sympathy for her and also a very strong demand for the Pakistani state to do something about this issue," said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. Much of the discontent is directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries. "This has created a very bad feeling for the Taliban," said Saleem Khan, an executive with a paper manufacturing company in the city of Lahore. Khan said he was "crying and weeping" after hearing of the attack on Malala, who had defied extremists in the northwestern Swat Valley by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, the first woman to hold that job, said Sunday that she thinks the shooting marked a "turning point" in the ferocity of how Pakistan goes after Taliban offenders and extremist groups. "Pakistan, at the diplomatic, political and every level, has been asking ... to take this matter seriously, to not let them (the Taliban) have a safe haven," she said. Meanwhile, police in Birmingham said "two well-wishers" were stopped when they came to the hospital overnight wanting to see the girl. No arrests were made, contrary to earlier reports from the hospital. Hospital director Dave Rosser said the intruders were "probably people being over-curious," but he added that the hospital is taking no chances and that tight security is in place.

Samuel Eto'o has rejected claims his move to Anzhi Makhachkala is all about money and claims he wants to transform the Russian club into a "big" team. The former Barcelona striker signed with Anzhi, who hail from the war-torn Dagestan region of Russia, on Wednesday from Italian outfit Inter Milan. The four-time African Footballer of the Year will be paid around $14 million a season for the length of his three-year deal with Anzhi said to have paid a reported fee of $30 million to seal the capture. Eto'o jetted into Russia on Wednesday and joined up with his new team-mates in Moscow on Thursday as they prepare for the weekend match with Rostov. Anzhi train in Moscow and fly to home games from the Russian capital -- a journey of some 1,250 miles. At a press conference Eto'o, who has won the European Champions League three times, told reporters he was excited by his new challenge. "I'm impatient to play the first home game, but most important to take this project from the base and make it big," he said. "I never say how many goals I'm going to score, my intention is to be happy and make sure that people around me are too. I think that when we are happy we can bring better results. "I'm happy that they have trusted me, with this project, I believe I can return to him (the Anzhi president) inside the field and outside as well, helping the club with good results." In local paper Sovietsky Sport daily the Cameroon striker insisted his move was not purely about finance. "The project is very interesting, money is not so important for me, that's just part of football," Eto'o was quoted as saying. "It was always important for me to be happy -- and now I am happy. I came to Anzhi because it is a new project and they are starting from scratch. I am interested. I have won everything I possibly could have in Europe." In a statement on Inter's official web site Eto'o thanked the club and its president, Massimo Moratti, for a "fantastic" two years in Italy. "I will never forget the affection of the Inter fans who made me feel like one of them and who always supported and helped me."	1
Support for abortion rights has fallen sharply in the past year, with Americans now split roughly 50-50 between those who back legal access to abortion and those who oppose it, according to a new survey. Anti-abortion activists demonstrate on Capitol Hill in Washington in September. The findings mark a dramatic shift in public opinion, supporters of abortion rights have outnumbered opponents for many years, with one brief exception, studies have shown. But only 47 percent of Americans now feel abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a drop from 54 percent a year ago, according to the poll. Meanwhile, 45 percent say it should be illegal in all or most cases. That's up from 41 percent a year ago. Given the survey's margin of error, the two camps are statistically tied. "These data suggest that a number of people have changed their minds in the past year," said Gregory Smith of the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, one of the survey's authors. It's not only one type of person or group whose opinion has changed, he said. "There was a drop seen in many, many demographics: men and women, people with a college degree and those with less education, people with various religious backgrounds," he said. The only groups whose opinions on abortion did not change were African-Americans -- who tend to oppose it -- and young people and those not affiliated with any particular religion, who tend to say it should be legal, he said. "Beyond that, this movement [was] across the board," he said. Anti-abortion activists welcomed the findings. "This is great news. This poll shows that the pro-life movement is winning hearts and minds. Pro-lifers are making an effective case that all women deserve better than abortion and that every child deserves a chance to be born," said Cathy Ruse, the senior fellow for legal studies at the anti-abortion Family Research Council in Washington. The Rev. Flip Benham, a Dallas, Texas-based anti-abortion activist, said the survey reflected a change he had already seen taking place. "It's something that we have known for a long, long time that's been beneath the radar," he said. "The heart of America is changing and only with time do the laws reflect that change." "When the church will come out into the streets, we win the battle," said Benham, director of operations for Operation Save America.	1
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not in a coma and is continuing to make strides in his recovery, his brother said. Chavez's brother, Adan Chavez, who is governor of Chavez's home state of Barinas, recently returned from Cuba, where the president is undergoing cancer treatment. Chavez, 58, has not made a public appearance since doctors operated on him a month ago. The long absence is not typical of the loquacious leader, who missed his own inauguration this week. "The head of state continues to assimilate treatment well and, each day, advances in his recovery," said Adan Chavez, according to a statement posted Saturday by his office. He characterized as "totally false" rumors that Chavez is in a coma and that his family was discussing the possibility of taking him off life support. Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. "We are sure that with the support of God, science and the people, our president will emerge from this new battle," the brother said. His comments came as Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, an ally of Chavez, visited Cuba in a show of solidarity, and just days after Chavez's health problems prevented him from being in Caracas for his inauguration ceremony. Throngs of supporters swore an oath of loyalty in his absence Thursday. Vice President Nicolas Maduro called on the masses gathered to take an oath of "absolute loyalty to the leadership of Comandante Hugo Chavez." The crowd repeated his words, holding thousands of tiny copies of the constitution up in the air. Opposition politicians have argued that delaying Chavez's swearing-in without designating a temporary replacement leaves no legitimate leader in charge of Venezuela. Chavez allies, including a majority of lawmakers in the country's congress, have said he should remain in power while taking the time he needs to recuperate. Venezuela's Supreme Court backed the government's position, ruling that Chavez began a new term on Thursday and can be sworn in later before the court. Before he left for Cuba for surgery, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he becomes incapacitated and called on voters to support him at the polls. CNN's Dana Ford and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.	1
Beijing hosted one of the most memorable Summer Olympics in recent history -- now the Chinese capital is hoping to welcome the world's top Winter Games stars for the first time in a joint 2022 bid. The 2008 host, along with the northern city of Zhangjiakou, is vying with several European cities after having officially entered the bidding, according to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC). Beijing would stage the ice events, reports the country's state-run news agency Xinhua, while snow-based competitions would take place in Zhangjiakou. "The 2008 Olympics has left many legacies to Beijing, which includes experience and sufficient infrastructure," Beijing Sports Bureau chief Li Yingchuan told Xinhua. "Take the Capital Stadium as an example, it has about 10,000 seats." Beijing hosted an International Skating Union competition earlier this month but would still require a new speed skating arena. There are plans to build an express railway line to cover the 174 km distance from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, which is in Hebei Province. It is estimated the journey time will be just 40 minutes, but Li is wary of the cost to the local environment. "The government has already started to tackle the problem," said Li. "I believe in 10 years the situation will be much better." China faces a fight to win the hosting rights, with Germany's Munich, the Norwegian capital Oslo, Almaty in Kazahkstan, Poland's Krakow, Ukraine's Lviv and Sweden's Oestersund all in the mix. There is also the fact that Pyeongchang of South Korea will host the 2018 Winter Games -- making it unlikely that another Asian country would succeed in 2022. "There is a rotation rule, though unwritten, in the bid. Since Pyeongchang won the 2018 bid, Beijing as another Asian city will face a daunting task to beat the odds," Li said. "I would say anything is possible. Even if Beijing loses this time, we will continue our efforts in the future." A decision on which country will host the 2022 Games will be made in July 2015 by the International Olympic Committee. Japan is the only Asian country to have hosted the Winter Olympics, in Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998).	1
Two news organizations' stories about National Security Agency surveillance, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden, have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service, often described as the highest prize in American journalism. The Washington Post and United States arm of The Guardian each received the prize on Monday. The Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University. More than a dozen prizes were announced on Monday, but the recognition of the NSA reporting was most significant because of the questions raised by Snowden's leaks and the reaction to them. The Pulitzer board's decision is bound to be controversial; then again, snubbing the NSA coverage would have been controversial, too. Snowden, who has been living in Russia while seeking asylum from U.S. prosecution, said in a statement that the Pulitzer board's recognition of the coverage was "vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government." "We owe it to the efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues who kept working in the face of extraordinary intimidation, including the forced destruction of journalistic materials, the inappropriate use of terrorism laws, and so many other means of pressure to get them to stop what the world now recognizes was work of vital public importance." While Snowden provided a trove of documents, reporters including Glenn Greenwald, working for the Guardian; Barton Gellman, working for The Post; and Laura Poitras, who worked with both, pored over the raw information, decided with their editors what parts were ethical to publish, and turned the information into stories that stunned readers around the world. On Monday the staffs of The Guardian and The Post celebrated the prize, ten full months after the first NSA stories were published. "We're extremely proud and gratified to have been honoured by the Pulitzer board," Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, said in a statement published on the British-based news organization's website. "It's been an intense, exhaustive and sometimes chilling year working on this story and we're grateful for the acknowledgment by our peers that the revelations made by Edward Snowden and the work by the journalists involved represent a high achievement in public service," Gibson added. Marty Baron, editor of The Washington Post, told his newsroom that without Snowden, "There would have been no public debate about the proper balance between privacy and national security. As even the President has acknowledged this is a conversation we need to have."	1
A few days after my little brother received death threats, he and I jumped on top of la Bestia -- the Beast -- the train heading north, to escape El Salvador. The country that financed the armed forces seeking to kill our friends and family would be our destination for safety. And like the millions of people forced into migration, I was compelled to leave my home for the uncertainty and waiting unwelcome of the United States. I left on my last day of college before graduation and dedicated myself to guaranteeing the safety of my brother, still a teen not much older than the unaccompanied minors currently arriving en masse at the U.S.-Mexico border. Although I cannot pretend to know their situation, I can see the faces of those we traveled with in the photos of those children crowded into detention centers. A family secret that changed his life Right-wing conservatives have fully seized upon this latest turn in the immigration debate to harp upon border security and scoff at troops unable to stop little children. President Barack Obama, who seems to have made it his mission to appease them in his first six years, would now do better to ignore them completely than to continue to step on the gas of his deportation apparatus. In a debate that has centered on criminalizing migrants and the act of migration, the faces of children, huddled and scared, hoping and vulnerable, defy vilification. Instead, they demonstrate what the President has declared but not yet acted on: Immigration is a humanitarian crisis. It is not to be met with soldiers, jails and handcuffs but with relief and aid. Opinion: How we can help kids crossing the border Intractable nativists, unable when confronted by these children to demonize people crossing the border, will turn to their equally favorite target -- demonizing the administration. One of the mouthpieces of anti-immigrant initiatives in the House, Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, insists on repeating the rumor that it was actually the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the misunderstanding of the prospect of immigration reform that caused the youths' arrival. He would want us to believe that this Congress has made legalization look so promising that children who would have otherwise stayed put are making the journey across a continent to be one of its rumored beneficiaries.	1

The U.S. Navy Seals' dramatic rescue of Poul Hagen Thisted and Jessica Buchanan early Wednesday ended the hostages' three-month ordeal in Somalia. But why was it left to the United States to conduct this operation in a country thousands of miles away? The short answer is that the United States has the military and intelligence capabilities to conduct the rescue of a U.S. citizen in pressing need of medical attention. The longer answer is that Somalia lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support. This is evidenced by the failed attempt of Somali forces to rescue a Danish family in March 2011, where, as has so often been the case, local authorities found themselves outgunned by the organized criminals. There are no Somali agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in Somalia, which has existed under a relatively impotent Transitional Federal Government since the central government collapsed in 1991. Most of Somalia is a patchwork of quasi-autonomous regions, across which neither governance nor law enforcement is coordinated. While most nations recognize the transitional government in Mogadishu as the legitimate government of Somalia, its reach is extremely limited. Local administrations are thus left to manage issues of organized crime with little resources or support. The result: Citizens exist in a precarious truce with a well-armed and organized criminal element. It is in this context of lawlessness that the United States opted to take direct action to release these two hostages. But such heroic and high-profile moves, by the United States or any other nation equipped for them, are not a long-term solution to Somalia's plague of organized crime, now spilling across borders. To break this cycle of crime, the international community must step up its commitment to investing in Somali stability and addressing the symptoms of the nation's governance vacuum. A recent report by the Center for American Progress estimated that $9 billion in humanitarian and development aid went into Somalia over the past 20 years. This is a stark contrast to the billions that piracy costs the world each year. A forthcoming One Earth Future report finds that $7 billion was spent on measures to address Somali piracy alone in 2011. If the international community does not shift toward building sustainable Somali law enforcement capabilities at sea and ashore, the only realistic options to resolve hostage situations will continue to be through military action or ransom payments. Among the ways money used to combat piracy is spent: 1. International Navies support operations to patrol Somali waters and the Western Indian Ocean.	1
Italy's Valentino Rossi edged out Yamaha teammate and title rival Jorge Lorenzo to claim pole position for the French MotoGP at Le Mans. The top spot on the timesheets changed hands several times in an exciting qualifying session on Saturday, with defending champion Rossi setting the fastest time on the 28th of his 30 laps. Rossi lapped in one minute 33.408 seconds to edge championship leader Lorenzo by just 0.054 seconds. Spain's Dani Pedrosa claimed the third spot on the front row for Honda. Australian Casey Stoner also strongly challenged on his Ducati, but had to settle for fourth fastest, just ahead of teammate Nicky Hayden. Home rider Randy De Puniet and Andrea Dovizioso of Italy were sixth and seventh fastest. Colin Edwards of the United States, Suzuki's Loris Capirossi were eighth and ninth best with Aleix Espargaro completing the top ten with his last lap. Rossi, who has won three times at Le Mans, trails Lorenzo by four points in this year's title race after both have secured wins in the opening two races of the season. The 31-year-old has been troubled by a shoulder injury after a motocross accident in April and admitted it was still a problem. "I am still worried about my shoulder because after 10 or 15 laps today I started to lose power, but I hope adrenalin will take over in the race and that I will be able to stay fast right to the end," he told the official MotoGP Web site. Lorenzo is hoping to double up after winning at Le Mans last year. "I need to try to get a good start tomorrow and be stronger during the first few laps, then I think I can fight for victory," he said.	1
Martin Greenfield is one of the world's most respected and accomplished tailors. Since emigrating from the former Czechoslovakia to America in 1947, he has dressed everyone from the Rat Pack and Leonardo DiCaprio to Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama. But Greenfield's success follows tremendous adversity. As a teenager, he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the Nazis. In this excerpt from his memoir Measure of a Man, Greenfield describes how an encounter with an SS guard at Auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time, and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes. Martin Greenfield: It was our second day inside Auschwitz. The soldiers asked if we knew any trades, like masonry, carpentry, medicine—that kind of thing. Dad grabbed my wrist and thrust it into the air. "He is a mechanic. Very skilled," he said. Above the gates at Auschwitz was a sign. It read Arbeit macht frei ("Work makes you free"). By volunteering my skills as a mechanic, my father protected me. It was his way of marking me for the Germans as a Jew whose skills they could exploit, as one not to be burned. As soon as my father offered up my skills, two Germans walked toward us to take me away. I then did something I should not have done, something stupid: I ran. Why, I do not know. Fences and soldiers were everywhere. Where did I think I was going? I cannot say. But for whatever reason, I ran. A few paces into my sprint, I heard a barking German shepherd barreling down on me. My arms pumped hard as I stretched my stride and ran faster than I'd ever run before. The barks got louder. I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in. He leapt and latched his teeth onto my leg. I looked down. The dog hung from my calf. I shoved his head with both hands. He snarled and gnashed violently as I struggled to pry him loose. The dog's jaw unlocked, taking a meaty chunk with him. Blood spurted on my prisoner uniform, the dog's mouth—everywhere. I tried not to cry. Not in front of my father, not in front of the other men and boys.	1
Win Tin, a founding member of Myanmar's National League for Democracy who was jailed for 19 years for political activism, has died at Yangon Hospital. He was 85. A National  League for Democracy leader from 1942-1958, Tin Tin was a member of parliament in 1948 and a co-founder of the NLD in 1959. He is regarded as one of Myanmar's leading modernists and one of the nation's most important intellectual lights. He was also one of the foremost voices for social justice while a prisoner of the Yangon prison, serving a total sentence of 18 years. In 1962, he emerged from prison as a deputy minister in the Burman government and subsequently became deputy secretary general of the party. His name became synonymous with the NLD after he was jailed by the military government.Tin Tin was born in Yangon in 1919 to a devout Buddhist family. He studied in Yangon before enrolling at Burman government University, where he studied law. He joined the NLD as a student leader in 1939, where he was arrested in 1942 for his student activities. He was jailed for a total of 19 years for his activism, including as one of the leaders of the April 26, 1942, student protest against forced recruitment, or "relocation". During his time in prison, the Burmese government used his writings to attack the NLD and to prevent him from continuing his activities in his writings, which are considered revolutionary by some Burmese historical scholars. During his incarceration, he learned to speak English and French to help him in his writing.Tin Tin was released in 1976 and began his political career working for the party as chairman of the Central Committee from 1972 to 1978. As a successful politician, he served as secretary general from 1978 to 1979, deputy secretary general from 1979 to 1980, president and chairman of the NLD in 1980, and secretary general in 2005. He was elected to parliament in 1988, representing Yangon. The next year, together with Nobel laureate Ueslei Faleomavaega, Tin Tin was awarded the Yangon Prize for Literature.Tin Tin was one of the most radical politicians in the history of Myanmar, along with Dr. Aung San Suu Kyi and Aung San. Some of his most powerful writings include "Political Awakening and the Struggle for Democratic Values", which was published in 1960, and "Political Awakening as a Liberation from Hatred", published	0
Inspired by a U.S. fact-checking website, a group of Egyptian activists has created the Morsi Meter, aimed at holding the new Egyptian president to his promises. It's "an attempt to document and monitor the performance of Egyptian President-elect Mohamed Morsi" over his first 100 days, the Morsi Meter website says. Much like the Obameter from PolitiFact.com, which tracks U.S. President Barack Obama's promises, the Morsi Meter lists numerous promises Morsi allegedly made while campaigning for the presidency, including offering incentives and promotions for police who restore security in their areas, new penalties for smuggling fuel, and changes on the streets to improve traffic. It's a project of Zabatak, a non-profit group that says its goal is to fight crime and corruption. Amr Sobhy, a 24-year-old organizer with the group, told CNN the idea for the Morsi Meter sprang from a conversation he had with another young activist.  "We decided to follow U.S.-like initiatives of monitoring the promises of politicians after the naming of the president," and one member of Zabatak began to write down Morsi's campaign vows, Sobhy said. "We are a group of Egyptians who don't belong to any political ideology and, for the record, we are not by any means political activists," he said. "We are average Egyptian youths who want to use whatever they do best to bring about change in Egypt." Egypt elections: 'Women need a champion' Sobhy said he voted for Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, over Ahmed Shafik, who served as the final prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak.  It was "a choice between revolution and reproducing the past regime." The group has not heard of any reaction from Morsi to the website. Unlike the U.S. presidency, Egypt's presidency is largely a figurehead position -- particularly after the military junta running Egypt recently claimed full legislative and budgetary authority and said the president has no control over the military. Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting "a good government" and gaining public support. "What matters to me here is how much support we are gaining, unexpectedly," for the Morsi Meter, he said.  He believes it will help change how candidates look at the electorate.	1
Judging solely by the headlines, one might conclude that China's economy is finally starting to hit a wall. After several decades of near double-digit annual growth, gross domestic product rose by a relatively cool 7.5% in this year's first half. Property prices  have plummeted by almost a third recently (see chart 1), and many of the world's largest producers have suffered major financial problems in recent years. Yet China's GDP still rises by an average of 11.2% a year. Its government-set growth target has been revised up from 6.5% to 7.5%. As a result, it now appears certain that China's economy will catch up with that of the U.S. next year, growing by at least 5% annually.But as the most populous country in the world, and the world's second-biggest economy (after China itself), one might want to temper the optimism, especially if one has an eye on the recent experience in Spain or Italy. If the world's economy slows further in the coming year or two, as it appears it may, China's growth trajectory could become even more sluggish as a nation and a region. If China slows in the long term, this should be no cause for concern; the U.S. economy would have a similarly long term stagnation problem in the absence of a strong and growing domestic economy. But for the moment China remains in good shape for one of the world's fastest-growing economies and most dynamic regions. And it remains the world's largest producer of rare earths, the chemical elements used to make televisions, laptops and cellphones.The good news is that China's economy is growing rapidly in several key areas: high-speed rail, the country's flagship new investment project; automobile manufacturing, which accounts for over 25% of the economy; and agriculture. Growth in these three areas was far more rapid in 2005 than at any time since the mid-1980s, when China was in the middle of a brutal economic crisis. The high-speed rail network, for example, has seen an annual average growth rate of 20% in the past decade, well over double the average for the rest of the world. And in recent months, China has begun to invest more in agricultural production, the engine of China's growth, than it has in any other sector. By some measures China's agriculture sector has been growing faster than the economy since 2000.The	0

Robin Lim, an American woman who has helped thousands of poor Indonesian women have a healthy pregnancy and birth, was named the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night. Through her Bumi Sehat health clinics, "Mother Robin," or "Ibu Robin" as she is called by the locals, offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. "Every baby's first breath on Earth could be one of peace and love. Every mother should be healthy and strong. Every birth could be safe and loving. But our world is not there yet," Lim said during "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and recognized Lim and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. Many women in the developing world do not have access to contraception or maternal care. According to the United Nations Population Fund, three out of five women giving birth in South Asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. In Indonesia, the average family earns the equivalent of $8 a day, according to the International Monetary Fund. But a baby delivery costs about $70 at a hospital, and a Caesarian section can cost as much as $700. Lim believes Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. "The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care," Lim told CNN earlier this year. The CNN Hero of the Year was chosen by the public after an 11-week vote on CNN.com. For being named Hero of the Year, Lim will receive $250,000 for her cause. That's in addition to the $50,000 that she and the rest of the top 10 Heroes each received for making the top 10. This is the fifth year that CNN, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world. Among this year's presenters were comedians Jerry Seinfeld and George Lopez; actors J.R. Martinez and Chris Colfer; musical artists Ice Cube and will.i.am; model Christy Turlington Burns; former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner; and actresses Laura Dern, Mary-Louise Parker and Sofia Vergara.

Iraqi forces appeared Wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push ISIS fighters out of the city of Tikrit. The Iraqi soldiers are reportedly approaching the city from five directions, as they seek сomplices to storm the ancient city and surrounding terrain.Tikrit, located about 150 km north of Baghdad, is an important Iraqi city, known for its archaeological sites, and it is the capital of the province of Tikrit.On Tuesday, Iraqi troops advanced to within 10 kilometers of Tikrit, and claimed to have taken over the town after one company captured an important hill.“The first Iraqi Army unit to be deployed to the area under the control of the joint forces, reached a line running on the north-south axis with some of the main areas of the city,” Brigadier General Abbas al-Lamiye’s statement said.“The units under the direction of Lieutenant General Abu Humam had advanced from the west in the direction of the city, while the units under the direction of Lieutenant General Mohammed Kadhim had advanced from the east, according to eyewitnesses. The units have captured a number of positions and have liberated a number of neighborhoods from the influence of the terrorists’ fire,” it said.The commander of Iraq’s First Armoured Division claimed that Tikrit is now in the hands of the Iraqi forces, after they stormed the city’s southern and northern gates Thursday on the third day of an offensive.The offensive reportedly started in the early hours of Thursday and was aimed at killing more than 500 ISIS members, according to local reports.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced Wednesday that the government has sent the first 20,000 Iraqi soldiers to the city.“Iraqi forces reached a position in a very important part of the city in northern Tikrit after seizing an important hill overlooking the city,” he said in a televised statement.Iraqi soldiers have attacked Tikrit, Iraq's second largest city, for the first time since ISIS swept through the northern city in August 2014 and took over much of the city.

Hundreds of people were injured in Bahrain Friday, when rival groups clashed over an attempted march in the town of Riffa, a residential area where the ruling Al-Khalifa family lives. The national health ministry said 774 people were injured Â​, including 45 in critical condition, in clashes between Al-Khalifa loyalists and protesters, which it called an “unprovoked attack.”The Health Ministry said a doctor was injured in the clashes and a nurse in critical condition.Bahrain security forces have killed a protester in a hospital just a week after seven demonstrators were killed and more than 80 other people wounded in a similar clash at Pearl Roundabout in Shiite Pearl Roundabout on Jan. 28.The national health ministry says there were three other deaths from other causes, including the burning of cars in Riffa in an attempt to prevent the opposition from getting medical care.Protesters took to the streets of Riffa for the second time Friday.

A Georgetown University student was charged on Friday with possessing ricin after admitting he made the poison in his campus dorm room, a court document showed. Daniel Harry Milzman, Â18, of Georgetown, was charged with one count of possession of ricin that caused bodily injury, according to court documents. The criminal complaint states that officers responded to Milzman's dorm room on Friday morning and found him to be "very emotional and agitated." He told authorities that he purchased the poison from an “acquaintance who lives in the area of Georgetown University," according to the court documents. When asked by officers about his intentions, Milzman identified himself as a member of the College Republicans, who were on campus for an event on Thursday night."If you are going to use my name, I will use yours," he said, according to the criminal complaint. "I’ve been trying to warn people ... That I do have this." Milzman also was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask when he was arrested, officials said. In addition to being charged with a felony, Milzman is also being investigated by the FBI to determine whether he posed a risk of danger to others, officials said.If you think I am a communist or worse because of this then you clearly don’t know who I am. I am a free-speech advocate, but that does not mean I am a communist. I am not trying to take over the world with my ideas. I would rather take over the ideas we can agree with than ones that we can not. In fact I am working to make sure that ideas like these do not happen.The University of Virginia student who took to social media to share a video of himself dressed in blackface and wielding an ax in reference to the KKK was confronted by members of the university’s NAACP chapter late on Friday, according to multiple reports on the social media.

U.S. troops were among the casualties in the shooting rampage at the Colorado movie theater, including a sailor who was listed as unaccounted for, the Pentagon said Friday. The Defense Department released a statement that said one sailor was injured and another one, known to have been at the theater, was unaccounted for. Two airmen were wounded in the incident, it said. Buckley AFB in Aurora, Colorado, is the closest military base to the scene of the shootings. Spokesman Master Sgt. Jill Lavoie said some of the wounded were from Buckley. About 10,000 troops -- including members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps -- are stationed at Buckley. Soon after the shooting, the base initiated a head count, Lavoie said. One of the units on base is the 743rd Military Intelligence Battalion. A post Friday on its Facebook page said that the Traumatic Stress Response Team (Mental Health Support) and Emergency Family Assistance Control Center (EFACC) had been activated at the base chapel. "If you or family members need assistance or counseling following the aftermath of the Aurora Movie Theater shooting, you can meet with the teams standing by to help you," the posting says. The DoD statement also said that the suspect, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report	1
Portuguese football legend Eusebio is in a stable condition after being admitted to hospital with bronchial pneumonia on Wednesday, his former club Benfica reported. The 69-year-old, known affectionately as the "Black Panther" and one of the most talented players of his generation, is being kept at the Hospital da Luz in Lisbon as the illness has affected both lungs. "He spent the night as well, and he is stable. From the clinical point of view (his condition) is stationary," the hospital's medical director Jose Roquette told reporters in quotes carried by Benfica's website. "There was no significant improvement in inflammatory parameters, analytical or radiological findings. So we continue with appropriate therapy and we hope this is resolved quickly." Roquette said Eusebio, who was the top scorer at the 1966 World Cup when Portugal finished third, would likely remain in hospital over the festive period after coming out of intensive care. "This is not a situation that one can guarantee how long will it take to evolution, but admit it will take some time. We will give more information in due course. Most likely it will extend beyond Christmas, "he said. Roquette said Eusebio's wife and daughters had come to the hospital, but other visitors had been restricted. In 2007, he had surgery to unblock arteries which carry blood to the brain. Eusebio played for three North American Soccer League teams in the twilight of his career, but is best known for his exploits in 15 years at Benfica where he scored 638 goals in 614 appearances up until 1975. "We wish a speedy recovery to Eusebio and also to express that the whole Portuguese football family is behind him," the Portuguese Football Federation said in a statement. "Eusebio is a symbol of Portuguese football. It will take a lot of strength to overcome this difficulty, but he has honored Portugal for many years with his distinguished presence, including as ambassador of the national team." Born in Mozambique, which was then a Portuguese territory, he scored 41 goals in 64 appearances for his adopted country. At the 1966 World Cup he scored two goals as Portugal eliminated defending champions Brazil at the group stage, then netted four times in an incredible quarterfinal comeback against North Korea as his side rallied from 3-0 down to win 5-3 in one of the tournament's most famous matches.	1
The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The FBI's investigation into the incident was "a close call" but did not turn up evidence of any radical political or religious beliefs, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation remains active. FBI agents interviewed the pilot Friday and also interviewed the man's brother, a U-S Army medic, a law enforcement official said. The two have been cooperative with the investigation, the law enforcement official said. It's unclear whether the man may have converted some of the seats to a fuel cell, which could be used to propel an airplane to high speed. However, that is the first report of an airplane being converted in this fashion, said David L. Anderson, a safety specialist for the National Transportation Safety Board. The man's actions were consistent with the type of acts a terrorist could likely commit in an airplane, Anderson said. "If he had a device to inject a fuel of the wrong type, you could really end up in a fatal accident," he said. One possible explanation is that the man planned to fly the jet into the IRS building to crash it in the lobby of the agency's downtown Washington office. Once inside, he could have used a gasoline-powered device to ignite fuel from a container of the wrong fuel in the aircraft. Investigators would have to determine whether the pilot had a legitimate reason for the flight. Because of the damage done by the crash, federal authorities decided it was too unsafe to try to conduct a full damage evaluation in the same building where the incident occurred, said a law enforcement official who was involved in the investigation. The building contains several offices of the agency as well as a satellite IRS building, but the only building on that block containing offices is the IRS, said the law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak by name.--- On The Money: The story is already a hot one, but the latest estimates say that the total in damages to the IRS is $4 to $7 million.Officials are now saying $4.6 million, and perhaps even $5.6 million.There are no details available on what exactly happened.However, the Washington Times	0
Sanford, Florida, city officials have chosen a former Colorado police chief as an interim replacement for the top cop who stepped aside during the furor over February's killing of an unarmed teen. Richard Myers, the former police chief in Colorado Springs, iced his resignation on Monday and was sworn in as an interim city manager Tuesday morning at a city council meeting.Under new mayor David Mann, a longtime friend of Sanford's who worked for the city for 24 years before that, the city has been thrust into an immediate crisis. There are calls on social media to remove Mann from office and replace him and his chosen replacement with new leadership that's more responsive to Sanford's black community.Mann, a retired police officer, has been sworn in to serve as mayor of Sanford for the next week as the city prepares to begin its search for a permanent leader.Mann has been mayor since 2009 and worked on the police and fire departments since 1988. He said he doesn't want to be mayor and it wouldn't be fair to others to take him on without a fighting chance."I want the people of Sanford to know that I will do whatever it takes to keep Sanford in the top 10," Mann said. "I have never done anything to hurt or betray the people of Sanford. The people of Sanford, like I have always said, have seen me as a friend, a confidant and a colleague."Related:Myers, who's lived in Sanford for the past five decades, said he'd like to be mayor for the next few weeks while he looks for a permanent replacement. He declined to comment on Sanford's other leaders or on the potential racial tension.A former chief in Colorado Springs, Myers, who is white, was selected by city officials to serve in a new role."He was considered the best fit," said Lt. James A. Brown, a spokesman for the city.

At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said. Five foreigners -- one American, one French citizen, and three people from Tajikistan -- were killed in the attack, Essam al-Naas said. Five Libyans were killed. The Libyan branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, and released photos of the two gunmen, it said had carried out the attacks as Abu Ibraheem Al-Tunsi and Abu Sulaiman Al-Sudani. Their naming convention indicates that the men were of Tunisian and Sudanese origin, respectively. Al-Naas said it appears the attackers were Libyans. American contractor David Berry was among the people killed in a terrorist attack at the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, on Tuesday, according to Cliff Taylor, chief executive officer of Crucible, a security firm where Berry was working. The FBI is expected to open an investigation into the incident, two U.S. officials told CNN. A State Department official confirmed the death of a U.S. citizen, but would provide no further information. A French citizen was among those killed, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Al-Naas earlier said at least two Libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel. An online group that supports ISIS said the attack was carried out in the name of Abu Anas al-Libi. Al-Libi was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. He was captured by U.S. special forces in Libya. He died in a U.S. hospital this month. A spokesman for the Corinthia Group in Malta told CNN there had not been a hostage situation in the hotel, as some reports suggested. "We are trying to take possession of the hotel back to assess the damage," he said, but Libyan security forces were not yet allowing that. The attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel. The gunmen then shot their way into the hotel. Guests were evacuated to safety, however. The five-star hotel is popular among government officials, some of whom reside there. A witness to the events told CNN that all roads leading to the Corinthia Hotel had been sealed by security forces.	1
Two French aviation design studios are betting on gambling in the air. Jean-Pierre Alfano of AirJet Designs and Frédérique Houssard, the founder of Designescence, have teamed up to create the Casino Jet Lounge, a luxe ersatz ersatz ersatz of the world's best private jets. The Lounge is set to open at the Dubai Airshow in late May, where it will compete with the world's most luxurious private jets, the Boeing 747, that are so close your seat could brush against them."There's a lot of different players in this industry and a lot of competition," says Alfano, a man whose company has been making private planes in France's Cannes Air show since 1988. "A big part of our work is always looking for a way to be different."Alfano and Houssard have a history.In 1992, Houssard founded Designescence, one of the first consumer-driven private jet design studios in France. There, she first worked with AirJet, designing an innovative jet pod and introducing the concept of private jets without engines. The design studio has created jet pods for clients including the Swiss watchmaker Panerai, the French media group Vivendi, and the European Union.Now, five years later, she's back after working with Alfano's company on the ultimate concept for a private jet lounge. Houssard and Alfano met at the World Air Show in 2015, and they formed the idea to design a private-jet-inspired lounge for the Dubai Airshow."I had the idea for a private jet-like lounge inspired by the private-jet-inspired cabins of the world's most luxurious planes," says Houssard, who grew up in a family of private jet enthusiasts.Alfano, a former CEO of a major hotel company, is a designer who wants his passengers to feel pampered and protected like VIP guests, not like the cramped, claustrophobic crew-less planes he and his business partners fly. "There's a lot of different players in this industry and a lot of competition," says Alfano, who is French, but has a dual Italian-French name because he was adopted into the royal family of Monaco. He has a degree in architecture from the University of the Arts in Paris, where he studied under Jacques Peretti.	0
Lawyers for former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have asked if he can serve his one-year sentence for tax fraud as community service, Milan's chief prosecutor said Friday. A judge will rule on the request, received from Berlusconi's lawyers Friday morning, in the coming days, Chief Prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati said. No details have yet been revealed as to what kind of community service it might be, when it might start or where it would be served, whether in Rome or Milan. Amanpour: Berlusconi turns Italy into a political Circus Maximus In recent days, Italian media have speculated that Berlusconi might look to carry out a community service order at a church or a refugee center in Rome, both near his residence in the capital. Italy's highest court in August upheld a four-year sentence handed down to Berlusconi by a lower court for tax fraud, of which he will serve only one year because of an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding. He is not expected to serve a prison term because of his age, leaving a choice between house arrest and community service. Berlusconi, 77, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has for decades been one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. Besides the tax fraud case, he is appealing a prison sentence handed down in June for abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. He has insisted the prosecutions against him are politically motivated. Last week, he was forced into a political climbdown when members of his center-right People of Freedom Party signaled they would defy his orders and back a coalition government in a crucial confidence vote. As it became clear that his bid to topple the government was doomed to fail, Berlusconi announced in the Senate that his party would support the confidence motion after all. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.	1
Apple has the pieces needed to build an iPhone model that can connect to just about any cellular network. The evidence was found under the hood of a new iPhone 4 unit made for Verizon Wireless. To work with the nonstandard infrastructure used by Verizon, Apple needed to deploy a different cell chip. The hardware company had to alter parts of the iPhone's construction in order to make it compatible, Apple COO Tim Cook said during the phone's coming-out event. While the new iPhone will only work on Verizon's network, the Qualcomm chip Apple is using in these new models is capable of connecting to Verizon's network, as well as to carriers using the GSM standard, which is what AT&T and T-Mobile USA have. The finding was unearthed by repair firm iFixIt in a full dissection of a Verizon iPhone obtained through the pre-order system. The silicon chip in the iPhone is the same type used in another Verizon phone, the Droid Pro. The latter smartphone is designed for frequent travelers and can be used easily in most countries overseas. But Apple didn't develop the first-run Verizon iPhones in a way that lets them work internationally, despite the building blocks being there. For one, it's lacking the crucial SIM card slot used for telling the phone which network it should connect to and what its phone number is. AT&T is positioning this travel-ready ability as a major competitive advantage of its iPhones, and of other phones made for its network. That Apple has a healthy supply of these dual-carrier chips could be a sign of an impending "universal iPhone." Charles Golvin, an analyst for Forrester Research, is confident that the next iPhone model, expected to come out this summer, will be capable of working on both Verizon and AT&T, along with most cell networks worldwide, he said in an interview.	1
The story has all the stuff that sells: a sexy starlet, a powerful enemy spy agency and lots of bare flesh. Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the  Times of India, turned out to be not so nude but at the very least provocative. Veena has come out to defend herself."I am very happy that my nude pictures which have been published in I-am, The Indian edition of the Indian Times magazine are now being seen in the world's largest circulated newspaper," said Malik, who is from the town of Bahawalpur in Pakistan."I cannot possibly explain all the reasons why my photographs which have been published in I-am are now being shown in the Indian Times, but I would like to say that it is nothing to do with the fact that my pictures are completely tasteful and that there is none nude, even in a magazine like I-am," she said.What she actually did was to go on a road trip and take some nude photographs of the people, places and things she found in her travels. The photographs were taken after the road trip and uploaded in a series of photographs on her website, I-am."For the purpose of travel, I was travelling alone without any other companion. I never took any photographs nor did I record the places I visited," Malik explained.A photo of Veena Malik during her road trip to GoaBut it was not all plain sailing for the actress. The Times of India published many different pictures of her. Her first nude pictures and those on her website were removed."I went to Goa to meet my boyfriend and fell in love. On the day of my arrival in Goa, I was asked to go to the photographer and they showed me the pictures I have taken while travelling on the road," said Malik who was accompanied by her uncle."They asked me to remove the pictures which were on the website. They said in the Indian newspaper I should change the picture. I said that I cannot give my pictures on the website and was told that I must take it off."Now a section of the public is demanding that Malik should apologise.

Manchester United returned to the top of the Premier League on Sunday after a 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. A close fought affair -- which marked the 600th league appearance of Ryan Giggs -- ended with honors even despite United defender Rafael Da Silva being sent off for two bookable offences in the 74th minute. His second yellow for a trip on Assou-Ekotto was adjudged to be deliberate, but a clearly incensed Rafael thought otherwise as he remonstrated with referee Mike Dean about the decision. Spurs had the better chances to win the match with Rafael Van der Vaart missing a glorious opportunity to claim three points in the 80th minute after a mistake in the United defence gave him a unopposed shot on goal. But the Dutch international could only curl his shot narrowly over the bar. Kenny Dalglish earned the first point of his second spell in charge of Liverpool as the Merseyside derby against Everton ended in a 2-2 draw at Anfield. Raul Meireles' first goal for Liverpool gave the Reds a deserved lead after 30 minutes in a half in which they dominated. But Everton hit back after the break with two goals in six minutes to take the lead. Sylvain Distin headed home after 46 minutes and Jermaine Beckford stunned the home supporters as he drilled home past Jose Reina to hand the Toffees the lead. But when Tim Howard brought down Maxi Rodriguez following a corner in the 66th minute, Dirk Kuyt made no mistake from the penalty spot. Liverpool and Everton both have 26 points, with Everton one place above their rivals thanks to a superior goal difference. In the other two matches played Sunday, the Tyneside derby ended in a 1-1 draw as Sunderland's Asamoah Gyan scored four minutes into injury time to deny Newcastle the three points and a season double over their arch rivals. A neat backheel by Kevin Nolan had given the Magpies the lead seven minutes into the second half. Newcastle looked destined to win the match until the Ghanaian striker put the ball in the net after a shot from Phil Bardsley shot had been saved by Steve Harper. Sunderland stay in sixth place, while Newcastle are ninth. Aston Villa have moved out of the relegation zone after salvaging a 1-1 draw with local rivals Birmingham at St Andrews.	1
Throughout President Barack Obama's political career, he has been dogged by insinuations or, indeed, accusations that he is not "black enough" to warrant strong support from African-Americans. Rep. Bobby Rush made that assertion when he successfully fended off Obama's effort to wrest from him his seat in the House of Representatives in the Democratic primary in 2000. Alan Keyes voiced that sentiment in his losing campaign against Obama for the U.S. Senate. When Obama accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party, the celebrity scholar Cornel West groused that the first African-American standard-bearer for a major party had "run from history" by failing to mention explicitly the "black freedom movement." Skepticism regarding Obama's racial bona fides has continued to surface since he moved into the White House. Rep. Maxine Waters, for instance, has recently chided him for failing to craft policies that would explicitly target black unemployment and for otherwise neglecting, in her view, to evince a proper acknowledgment of the baleful and disproportionate pain being experienced in black communities on account of the economic downturn. What is one to make of this critique? First, it should not be at all surprising. Black America is ideologically diverse, just like other communities. Moreover, as I document in "Sellout: The Politics of Racial Betrayal," there exists in black America a special anxiety about the loyalties of high achievers, especially when their success is largely dependent on whites and others who are not black. Every prominent black in a predominantly white setting faces, at one time or another, claims from fellow blacks that he or she is "selling out." Second, Obama's black detractors receive a degree of attention in the news media that is far greater than their representativeness of black America or their influence within it. The great bulk of black American voters -- upward of 90% -- supported Obama in 2008 and do so today. They do so because of his party affiliation, his liberal policy preferences, his identification with the African-American community (the offspring of an interracial couple, he calls himself black and married a black woman), his personal attractiveness -- he is uncommonly articulate, handsome, knowledgeable and gracious -- and the fact that with all of the added burdens attendant to his blackness, he was still able to climb the Mount Everest of American politics.	1
It could be the worst mass poisoning in history. And the terrible irony is that it may all be due to an idealistic push to clean up drinking water for some of the world's poorest people. A new study published in British medical journal The Lancet says that up to 77 million people in Bangladesh are being exposed to toxic levels of arsenic, potentially taking years or decades off their lives. An international team of researchers from Chicago, New York and Bangladesh followed 12,000 people over the past decade, monitoring their arsenic intake and mortality rates from contaminated wells. By the end of the study, one in five deaths were determined to be directly related to elevated arsenic levels in their system. Stretch that over the entire population that takes its water from wells, and the impact is daunting. The problem has been known about for years, if not the overall deadly impact. As far back as a decade ago, the World Health Organization called it "the largest mass poisoning of a population in history... beyond the accidents at Bhopal, India, in 1984, and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986." Well-meaning development groups had encouraged remote villages across Bangladesh to dig wells over the past decades, rather than rely on potentially contaminated surface water and dirty rivers. But now potentially a much worse problem has been found far below the surface. Arsenic is a deadly poison with a history of use in intrigue and assassination. Some have even theorized that Napoleon Bonaparte succumbed to long term poisoning with the substance by his enemies while in exile on the island of St. Helena. But the element and its derivatives are also used in many industries, such as metal smelting and as a component in products ranging from insecticide to micro-chips. And unfortunately, it is also found in abundance in the soil and rock in Bangladesh. It's leached up through the water table in tens of millions of water wells across the country. The study showed that the top quarter of those exposed had a 70 percent higher mortality rate than would be expected in the population as a whole. The authors hope for more study, and a long term plan to deal with the damage already done. But a solution for those already poisoned may remain decades away. Other long term health studies have shown it takes 20 years for the negative morbidity effects of arsenic poisoning to dissipate, even after they stopped using contaminated wells.	1
Borrowed place, borrowed time. That was the mantra in Hong Kong as the clock ticked down to the British colony being handed back to China in 1997. And as the handover loomed, Hong Kongers were frantic to make money to get a passport before the communist mainland reclaimed the territory. They feared an end to the free-wheeling ways of capitalism where money brought power, prestige -- and if needed, an escape route. But there was a small, vocal minority who talked instead about the tail wagging the dog. Far from being subsumed by China's political system, Hong Kong would in fact lead it towards democracy. Why? Because, if this handover worked, it could lure a much bigger prize in the form of Taiwan. If democracy, prosperity and personal freedoms flourished in this territory, Taiwan could be induced to rejoin China after its seminal split in 1949. Opinion: Why Beijing is courting trouble But events of the past week have been a watershed in Hong Kong's political development. The ultimate goal of universal suffrage -- one person, one vote -- has been subverted. Yes, there will be one person, one vote, but Beijing has said they want to control who Hong Kong's voters are allowed to vote for. China's leadership has made it crystal clear that any form of democracy will only come attached to very powerful Chinese characteristics. Hong Kong's first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, who stepped down early after massive protests against his leadership, this week called Beijing's move towards democracy "real and substantive." It's hard to see how. If anything, Beijing has slammed the door on a true democratic process, one that allows anyone to stand for election. Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians have said they will veto any proposal that doesn't allow for full suffrage, leaving the Special Administrative Region back at square one. Muted reaction Yet Hong Kong has hardly exploded in anger or frustration. In fact the reaction has been almost muted. Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a protest group committed to true universal suffrage, had threatened a campaign of bringing business in downtown Hong Kong to a standstill if China didn't allow for a more democratic process. In June, it conducted an unofficial referendum on the issue. Nearly 800,000 people out of a population of seven million took part despite, or perhaps because of, repeated and sophisticated cyber-attacks and overt criticism from Beijing.	1
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on health care reform, the justices have one thing in common, and one thing in common with a growing cohort of Americans: They are aging. America faces an unprecedented wave of aging as members of the iconic baby boomer generation turn 65. This year alone, 4 million Americans will join the growing ranks of senior citizens. The Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare system that this growing senior population relies on. Health care reform reduces the cost of prescription drugs, brings down costs for patients using private Medicare supplements and increases access to free preventative services. The Affordable Care Act makes health care more affordable for senior citizens and ensures that doctors are compensated fairly for their services. While Medicare certainly needs adjusting, if the law is overturned, the challenges of Medicare financing will only get worse. For the millions of senior citizens and about-to-be seniors in America the improvements brought by  health care reform are just an important first step. We must protect the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, but much more is needed to support our rapidly growing older adult population to help them live independently, at home and in our communities with dignity. A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care. The average hourly wage of a home care worker in the United States is less than $10 per hour. Poverty wages and a lack of benefits, training and career pathways mean turnover is constant. The work force can barely meet the current need for care, supports and services, let alone what's to come. More families are turning to immigrant women of color to provide care for their loved ones. These women work tirelessly to feed and bathe our nation's senior citizens, serve as a go-between with family and doctors, count medication, even take care of pets, and yet they are denied basic wages, let alone benefits, worker protections and pathways to citizenship. In fact, one out of two direct care workers supplements his or her income with food stamps, Medicaid or public benefits, compounding our overall challenge. News explainer: Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling We need to create more jobs in America, address the need for home care, and improve the quality of care jobs all at the same time. In so doing, we can create precisely the type of economic growth we need in this moment. These are issues that concern us all including, ultimately, Supreme Court justices.	1
Two catchphrases have dominated stories about women in the election cycle this year: "the war on women" and "having it all." It is time to change the conversation. Women are the voters most  passionate about issues.When President Trump said, "women, they like men who treat them fairly" at a rally this month, one of us thought, "that's interesting." But, when one of us asked her to write an op-ed about it, she said, "that's not what Trump said." When another asked her to write an op-ed on the GOP tax plan, she said, "I can't, it's all about women." When one of us got a text message on how one of them was going out with a certain candidate, we asked her to write an op-ed for him, and she didn't get back to us. When we asked a woman on the campaign trail to write an op-ed for us on why the gender gap was important, she said, "no, I can't." We called her back at the end of the day, and she told us she only had the following message: "No," she said, "I'm a woman, I can't write about women."When we asked one woman to write an op-ed on why the gender gap is important this year—a campaign season after multiple women were accused of sexual misconduct (or harassment) and/or misconduct—she said she only had a brief answer that she planned to "use in a tweet." When we asked another, a woman who had lost a child, to write an op-ed for us on protecting children, she said she could "probably" do so, but would "have to think about it." When we asked a woman on the campaign trail to write an op-ed on why she was voting for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump this year, she said, "I think my vote really is to elect Hillary," but she could "probably spend some time" writing one. Then she added, she may have to do an op-ed to get it written.The conversation was different this year because we had been told by so many women that they didn't feel safe to talk about gender inequality or sexual harassment—that this election season's "conversation" was largely negative, and that a lot of men were talking negatively about women.As Election Day rapidly approaches	0
Ronney Jenkins cannot be sure whether chronic traumatic encephalopathy is clawing through his brain tissue right now, but he suspects that it is. After all, he fits an emerging portrait of people diagnosed with the disease: a  mix of those who experience a gradual deterioration, those who experience an immediate and dramatic onset, and those who appear to suffer from a condition that begins with a gradual onset and ends with a more rapid deterioration. One of Jenkins' close friends and co-workers, who is in a similar boat, recently received diagnosis of CTE (his brain and spine already show signs of the disease).Jenkins' diagnosis came by way of a routine brain scan. It was in 2008, and the scan had been ordered by his neurologist, Dr. Stephen Fava, while Jenkins was serving as a volunteer on an Army study involving a "substance abuse questionnaire" in which he disclosed an interest in smoking cannabis.Fava ordered the scan because, while not yet diagnosed with CTE, Jenkins had already been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury. On the physical exam, he had obvious signs of head trauma: a bump on the head; headaches that made it hard to sit or lie down; and blurred vision.But he was not on any sort of regular drug regimen, and his blood pressure wasn't high. He hadn't been in a car accident. "I just had a concussion," he said.In fact, he had suffered more than one. He had been in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008, when he was hurt and the injury was not diagnosed until he and his friends were back home. He had been in another car accident just months before Fava's diagnosis.Still, Fava didn't think much of Jenkins' concussion."He said he had a headache, and he wasn't sure if it was from the motor vehicle accident or from a mild traumatic brain injury," Jenkins said. "But the thing about it is, this was the problem with him: he never really wanted to think about it."Jenkins had, as he would later learn, had a brain that, like a lot of people who suffer from CTE, was not always functioning properly.Jenkins went through college and worked hard to make sure that his brain functioned well. He was always taking classes. He studied when he could, but then he would go back to work.He	0
A convicted child pornographer in Pennsylvania was sentenced Tuesday to 12 years in federal prison, thanks in part to three girls featured in CNN's Ã‚Â investigation, the network said."The sentence will be handed down for one of the worst child predators in Pennsylvania history," CNN President Jeff Zucker said in a statement. "It is a message to parents and guardians: Don't let your children down the street walk into a house full of people who are watching them. Don't let the child be alone with you at that party or in your home. Don't let your family members and loved ones put your child on the Internet."Kelsey Averitt, who was 17 at the time of the crime, was the first victim to speak to CNN. She said what happened to her was "horrible" and that she was "ashamed to be alive.""My life changed after this," she said in a tearful interview with CNN.She said she was at a party with her best friend and another girl on the night of Aug. 1, 2008, the night the three girls were found with their pants at their knees and their underwear pulled down. She said she was in bed and left her room in the morning. As she walked past her bedroom door, she noticed a "pile of clothes thrown on the floor." The clothes were left there when she went to get dressed the next morning.The girls told police the sexual assault occurred at another home they all attended that night. But Averitt said the rape was also in her house, not at the home of another girl at the party.The first girl to give police her version of the crime was K.M., who was then 15. K.M., who was interviewed by police in November, said Kelsey had asked her to masturbate in front of her before she raped her.A former neighbor of Kelsey's in Philadelphia said the girl, who has since graduated from high school, had "a very troubled past." The girl told police her father had sexually abused her and beat and kicked her mother, a former prostitute. Kelsey, a member of an online forum and chat room, befriended K.M., who was friends with her.She said Kelsey and a man she identified as "M" -- who she said was a former friend and roommate -- had taken turns telling her stories about sex	0
A federal judge in New Orleans ruled Thursday that Transocean is not liable for Deepwater Horizon compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. There are more ills and problems ahead. The nation was warned again on the eve of a new fiscal year that the government faces the same fiscal challenges it has faced for the past decade.The House passed its version of the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, avoiding a government shutdown with its vote to override President Barack Obama’s vetoes. The Senate is expected to do the same next week, although that’s in doubt after lawmakers were unable to agree on a budget deal for 2013.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has scheduled a special closed-door, off-the-record session of the House for late Friday. Lawmakers are expected to meet again to vote on a compromise budget deal, which also faces a veto.The nation’s economic leaders are in the final weeks of a fiscal year that ended with a government shutdown. Here’s what’s next:“We will start the new fiscal year on a good note,” Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said last week. “Our first priority is to make sure that America’s checks are getting deposited at the end.”The House is set to vote on Jan. 13 on a stopgap spending bill to fund the government through the end of the month. Republican leaders are working to pass the bill this week. But it’s unclear if President Barack Obama’s signature Obamacare law would survive the government shutdown.The House is considering a so-called clean continuing resolution (CR) that would fund the government through the end of the month, while delaying the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for several months. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates that the cost of implementing Obamacare could be as much as $25 billion.This time the Republicans are trying to put the blame on the other side, a Democratic President. But the fight is not over.The debate over whether to extend the government funding and the implementation of Obama’s healthcare law is only beginning. On Thursday, lawmakers voted on a stopgap bill to keep the government funded through the end of the week, with the ultimate aim to pass their own measure that would defund Obamacare in the Senate.

President Barack Obama, Democratic governors and even a Republican Cabinet member on Friday blamed GOP intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect March 1. The increasingly strong entreaties for Republicans to discuss a middle-ground solution with Obama and Democrats showed White House concern over the impasse, as well as its ability to mount a message campaign during a week that Congress is on break. At issue are $85 billion in mandatory across-the-board spending cuts this fiscal year that both sides agree will harm the economy and national security. However, the intractable ideological divide over taxes, spending and the role of government has led to another political showdown in Washington like those that dominated Obama's first term. The president met with Democratic governors at the White House and later told reporters that the forced spending cuts -- known in Washington jargon as sequestration -- were the "wrong prescription" for reducing the nation's chronic deficits and debt. Others were less diplomatic. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin called Republicans "obstructionist," while Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy accused GOP legislators of false claims about the issue that he said the news media reported as truth. "This is craziness," Malloy said, adding that a lack of leadership among congressional Republicans meant "there's nobody to deal with anymore." Outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the lone Republican in Obama's Cabinet for now, also called on GOP legislators to fully join the debate. He noted the impending cuts would mean lengthy flight delays and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April without a deal. "I think Republicans need to step up here," LaHood told reporters at the daily White House briefing, where he appeared with Press Secretary Jay Carney. "This requires compromise. This requires Republicans stepping forward with some ideas about how to keep essential services of government running at a level that people are accustomed to." At issue are the forced cuts and how they came about. They were mandated under a 2011 agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit, intended to motivate Congress to negotiate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal rather than face unpopular reductions in military and non-defense spending. Republicans contend the idea came from Obama and continually refer to the cuts as "the president's sequester," while the White House notes GOP leaders also endorsed and voted for the plan before Obama signed it into law.	1
Does the idea of spending time in the Magic Kingdom with the Mickey Mouse gang leave you thinking "Oh, rats!"? Does the idea of spending time with the hot people of Miami's trendy South Beach leave you cold? Well, don't give up on Florida just yet. There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's "Old Florida." (And I'm not talking retirement communities here). Sometimes thought of as "Forgotten Florida," I'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state. It's the part that thrived a century ago during the first waves of development but has been bypassed by most tourists in recent decades for Orlando and points south. This is the Florida where the Deep South intermingles with the tropics. Here, oaks draped with Spanish moss stand guard over saw palmetto and vivid flowers. They all thrive by crystal-clear rivers and springs. Its towns are smaller, quiet and friendly. Many of its attractions emphasize the natural environment. It's a place for hiking, biking, kayaking, snorkeling, tubing and fishing. And you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds. I made two visits down there this summer and fall. Here are nine spots worthy of a visit: 1. Cedar Key Welcome to Mayberry by the Sea. This Gulf Coast fishing village, about 50 miles southwest of Gainesville, is gloriously isolated and seemingly of another era. There are no chain restaurants, hotels or grocery stores here (or none that I ran across). What you will find here: An unassuming town of modest and funky tin-roofed homes, a few '50s-style motels and quaint shops. Lots of folks get around via golf carts and bicycles, which they don't seem to ever lock up. Art is a big part of the town, with all manner of public displays popping up. Charter boats at the marina offer fishing excursions and exploration rides, including sunset cruises. With such a relaxed atmosphere, Cedar Key has a bit of a Key West vibe -- minus the all-night party atmosphere. This is a town that goes mostly silent by 10 p.m. Cedar Key's culinary fame is clam chowder. The Big Deck had such good chowder I went back for a second night.	1
There was no feeling in Matthias Lanzinger's leg when he regained consciousness in hospital after his skiing accident. As he blinked and opened his eyes, his first question to his wife, who was sitting at his  right, was: "Did you miss me?" She smiled and said: "Not much, only just now when you woke up."Lanzinger's body had been crushed against an artificial ski lift in the middle of the piste. The accident had occurred when he was skiing on the slopes. He was sitting in his downhill sled and his head was resting on the skis, which were just lying on the ground. According to the official accident report, he had been unable to free himself from the lift, and he was in the process of falling when his legs were caught in the net. As a consequence, he was thrown towards the piste.According to his doctors, he had suffered a severe concussion and several fractures. As his lungs and heart were not functioning, he had to be intubated. Doctors also had to amputate the top of his right leg below the knee. His head and right leg were amputated on the operating table. A week after the operation he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he would stay for more than three months. During this time he was not allowed to use any mechanical wheelchair or prosthesis. He could, however, use his good arm, which had been amputated above the elbow.When he left the intensive care unit for his regular hospital visit on the 15th of October, he could hardly walk. He could only lie in bed and support himself on the furniture. He was never able to stand up without using his other arm. This time he had to use crutches because he developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the operating theatre while the doctors were operating on his leg. He had to sit up straight and had to take his crutches off and put them away when they weren't needed.He could now only walk five or six metres. And then only with crutches. He was still able to use his good arm, but because of his weakness his arm was a little stiff and the blood moved a little differently when he was walking. Doctors still tell him today that he could have stayed in bed for six months. In his case, it was not a question of how much he could live. It was a	0
Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that "fracking" -- a process used to drill for natural gas -- is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain ills as crimes worthy of criminal punishment?For more than a decade, that question has raged in the courtrooms and lecture halls of America. It took a real effort by the movie industry to win approval for its depiction of human rights. But now the industry has won a bigger battle.Over the last several months, the U.S. government has produced a series of reports and internal documents that are providing critical evidence that films like The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty will encourage and even compel U.S. citizens to engage in torture, war crimes and human rights violations. Those warnings came from CIA torture and interrogation specialist Scott Shane, who said in a recent BBC interview that the agency has learned that movies that depict torture, war crimes and human rights abuses can have a substantial influence on U.S. consumers.[The movie business] had learned the lesson that, for decades, they had bought into the idea that movies were, well, they're entertainment. They don't have anything to do with what's going on... The movies they bought into were that they were entertainment. And the more the movies got better, the more the filmmakers were able to get away with the outrageous stuff. And of course there's always a dark little corner in the mind of every consumer, right? They're thinking, "How can I get past this movie and have a real life?"In an interview with Motherboard earlier this month, Shane, the former torture and interrogation specialist who provided the CIA with guidance on how to improve its interrogation techniques, said he had watched the new Bond film Spectre with his daughter, and noticed its depiction of torture."I have a feeling with the new 'Bond' -- and I'm not making a political statement, I'm not saying anything about politics to avoid any repercussions of that. I just want people to know that the whole thing with James Bond is that he's more comfortable with torture. He is more comfortable with the techniques that they use to get him to do these things. He is comfortable with torturing people for information, and torturing people who have nothing to do with the 'Mission Impossible' franchise."He then noted that he "never saw	0
President Bush's top adviser on homeland security is stepping down after 4½ years on the job, the White House said Monday. Fran Townsend served more than four years as homeland security adviser. Homeland Security _______ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________ ________________________________________By DOUGLAS M. GILMOREStaff CorrespondentWASHINGTON -- When John Kelly -- the former head of U.S. Southern Command and ____ __________________________________________ _________________________________________ took over as homeland security adviser in February, he had a top secret clearance and held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps.By the end of the month, his clearance was downgraded to the level of information management specialist -- a position with less access to intelligence and the ability to read classified material.As a result of the latter change, Kelly is being forced to resign his job because there is no provision in law to allow the government to keep the civilian employees of the Pentagon, Defense Department and Army to work for the duration of the continuing war on terrorism.A presidential order dated March 1, 2007, required all government civilian employees, including those at the Pentagon, to have a security clearance. Kelly's clearance was downgraded in December in the face of strong recommendations that, according to the inspector general's report that was made public recently, he should have been told of the change to Information Management Specialist.The recommendations said Kelly's clearance should be returned to the higher level of security clearance -- the same as Townsend, the former special assistant for homeland security who announced his plans to leave in a news conference.Kelly was at all times under the supervision of the chief of staff for the president, Karl Rove. His office was on the seventh floor of the Pentagon at Joint Base Andrews in the United States.After the White House learned of the pending resignations of three high-ranking officers who were at the helm of the Department of Homeland Security on the night of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, it asked the inspector general for the final report on the matter.The resulting report, issued in the wake of the inspector general's findings, called the government's security policy for protecting classified and top secret information "ill-considered" and "inefficient."It said the government should have notified "all current and former government civilian employees of the need to have a security clearance in light of	0
Tensions are running high following the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, and that is exactly how it should be. The correct, human response to an atrocity of this nature is revulsion and deep moral anger. Far from  excusing the attacks, we should be fighting with every resource at our disposal for a just, democratic society. The only way to stop this madness is for everyone to speak out against it and demand justice. That’s the bottom line: we must fight back against the violence. We must not stand idly by. That’s the bottom line for all of us: that we will speak out for those who are not heard.That’s not a radical call. It’s not a new idea. We’ve been calling for people to speak out against injustice for years. But with so much anger now bubbling to the surface, it’s not as simple as ‘we’re all in this together.’ We all want to see those responsible held accountable, those with the most hatred punished most severely, the most vile, most dehumanising of language silenced, the most repugnant of practices destroyed.We’re seeing this new wave of violence erupting around the world in unprecedented numbers and it’s having a real impact. Over 2,300 people died from the effects of extreme weather – heatwave, heavy rains and storms – between 1 March 2014 and 5 March 2015. That’s a much bigger tragedy than the Charlie Hebdo massacre.A staggering 50,000 people were killed during the Syrian conflict, and those deaths have yet to be investigated or properly acknowledged. More than 70,000 died in Nigeria from Boko Haram’s bloody onslaught in 2014.And in South Africa, between April 2017 and April 2018, nearly 4 000 people were murdered. Not once in the country’s history has there been a similar number of murders. When something like that happens, it’s as if all of a sudden, everybody stops talking and turns their attention to what’s happening around them. That’s where I’m coming from: we are in a crisis. That’s where we need to be spending our time and energy and focus - fighting a new wave of injustice.We must do this with a clear conscience. Yes, we are all in	0
Joao Victor Marcari Oliva could become one of Brazil's brightest Olympic talents, if he can step out of the shadows of a legend: his mum. Oliva is the son of Hortencia Marcari, who led Brazil's women to the basketball world title in 1994 and Olympic silver at the Atlanta Games two years later. "Hortencia is a celebrity at the level of a great soccer star here in Brazil," says basketball writer Marcos Antonio. "She was a born scorer, a 'clutch player' -- it was almost impossible to block her shots. She was always on TV." Oliva says: "Every time I'm walking down the street with my mum, there are a lot of fans taking photos of her and people asking for autographs. Sometimes that gets boring -- but it's nice." A fraction taller than his mother at 180 cm (5 foot 10 inches), the teen has shunned a career in basketball. His heart is set on an entirely different sport: dressage. "I have my mother's blood when it comes to sport, but my father bred horses. When I was young, I spent all my time with them," says the 18-year-old, whose mother played in the Atlanta '96 basketball final just months after he was born. "If my mother was someone else, I wouldn't be talking to you. A lot of people in the media speak to me because they know my mum. I think that's a good thing: it's good for me, and good for my job." With a home Olympic Games two years away, the Brazilian equestrian team is in the middle of an unprecedented push for success on the world stage. Oliva belongs to the next generation of Brazilian riding talent hoping to capture imaginations, if not medals, at Rio 2016. Brazil has virtually no history of dressage -- one of three equestrian disciplines at the Olympics -- so Oliva has moved to Germany, one of the sport's leading nations, to find better tuition. "I don't want to win in Rio -- I don't think that's possible," he says. "I have a lot to learn and Europe is too strong in the sport. But I'm here, and I will learn like a European. I think I can be a good rider." The nation has hired world-renowned experts to help its riders develop. New Zealand's Mark Todd, for example, is coaching the Brazilian eventing team.	1
College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole. This year, according to the College Board, average published in-state tuition and fee plus room/board charges exceed $17,000 at four-year public  schools and more than $42,000 for private institutions. And in-state tuition at a state university averages about $8,100, and fees nearly equal an out-of-state student’s tuition at a private institution. The College Board also reports that over 30 states and the District of Columbia provide tuition assistance to students who attend private nonprofit and state colleges and universities.Students can’t afford college, and the college system’s tuition-support programs don’t provide adequate financial aid.The American Association of University Professors estimates student debt in the nation’s top four-year institutions exceeds $1.2 billion. This debt is growing and continues to widen college access gaps.Many students aren’t able to work while in school. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in 2012 about half of students who enrolled in some kind of coursework in high school were not working to support themselves, and this percentage has been growing since the 1970s when the percentage was about a third.Students with the least education are falling behind. Despite graduating with high school diplomas, almost one-third of American high school graduates lack basic college-level skills, and of this category, a majority are low-income students – the majority of whom attend for-profit colleges.The median income for college-educated women is $46,000 per year, and the national median is $52,000.The government doesn’t understand the problem. The College Board published its report in October saying that college graduates are twice as likely now to start businesses, and four times more likely to be employed in their careers, and that the college degree helps a lot when it comes to landing jobs.If you want a college degree, it’s probably hard to get. At the end of the day, we have to accept that American students are getting education that’s not necessary to support our society. As the U.S. Census Bureau reported, in 2012, 12% of American adults didn’t graduate from high school, and one-third of high school graduates (35% of them women) didn’	0
Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions, is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score. The 29-year-old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind  Sergei Mchitshulakidze, an assistant to the Bolshoi's chief choreographer, Maria Sverijkovska. The alleged crime was that Mchitshulakidze had given Dmitrichenko the idea for a new and deadly routine that he presented as a gift to the Bolshoi director. Mchitshulakidze then had the idea of replacing the victim with the "blind" Mchitshulakidze, a move that became the basis of an entire dance act that Mchitshulakidze would stage after the murder.According to Mchitshulakidze, though, this story is a fabrication. He insists that Dmitrichenko never taught him the murder's details, that he "never thought of such a thing," and that Mchitshulakidze "never would have accepted that kind of a gift." It is the first and most damning example of Dmitrichenko's alleged perfidy, which has long been documented by other sources. So Dmitrichenko—a Bolshoi apprentice who was making his stage debut in a series of ballets choreographed by Mchitshulakidze—is now a defendant in a case that, based on the court records, certainly seems like a choreography by Mchitshulakidze.Dmitrichenko's case is one of a handful of cases in the 1990s and early 2000s in which the Bolshoi, or other major ballet companies, have brought suit against young dancers. These cases—which resulted from a desire by some of the players to expose the fact that the Bolshoi is a large and influential employer, which is the case when it comes to choreographic talent—are of particular interest to me because, as an American, I have spent most of my life trying to discover what makes Russian dancers tick.As I began to dig deeper into Ballet roles for an article I was writing for The New York Times Magazine, I read hundreds of memoirs and eyewitness accounts from those who had worked with great Russian ballet stars, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, Mar	0
Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, according to Chihuahua state prosecutor's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez. Police look on as one of the nine bodies found in a urn in a secluded area in the desert John Moore/Getty ImagesPublished 10:00 pm, Monday, September 26, 2008A body was discovered in a roadside urn in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, according to the attorney general's office and the state's police chief.The urn contained the body of a man whose face had been badly mutilated, authorities said, and that person or another was burned, according to the prosecutor's office.The discovery was made Sunday in the Cielo Azteca region, on a stretch of highway between Ciudad Juarez and Parral.A man who was driving by the site reported seeing multiple bodies along a roadway. Chihuahua state police, who have jurisdiction over the area, called for a second urn containing a body to be delivered, according to the prosecutor's office."They're going to find more bodies, they're going to find more," Chihuahua Public Safety Commissioner Raul Gonzalez told CNN.The bodies of the man and another were found in the same area of land, according to Gonzalez.The case, being investigated by police and the office of the attorney general, is being treated as a murder.A manhunt is underway for the person or persons using gasoline to burn the bodies and an accelerant, according to the prosecutor's office.The bodies were buried in the desert. The bodies were dumped into a pickup truck and taken to a cemetery where the ashes of the victims are scattered, according to the prosecutor's office.Chihuahua Governor Giovanny Herrera said he was not informed of the discovery until late Saturday night."We were told by the state police ... that they found more bodies," he said.Guadalupe Salas, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said her office received a call about the discovery on Sunday and that the bodies were buried Sunday."We are only concerned with the investigation," she said. "We don't have a final [body] count yet."Gonzalez said the bodies in the urn can be identified	0
Sleeping in our caves is a mystical experience," says Umberto Paolucci. "You'll find your spirit and the real essence of life. Even if you're looking for neither." As the co-owner of Grotte della Civita, a  cave in the Alps where the lights in the night are the stars, Umberto has experienced all that the cave represents. "It's the same in the world of art." The walls, a masterpiece of art, that he has collected in his travels, "represent all the different forms that art and life can take. I love it because it's the real thing. It's an experience that is not false."The world that surrounds you is a little like the cave. In the cave, you are in touch with your spirit, but the world is more of the same. "We're the masters of the world. We are not the slaves of the world, nor of the other. Here we take care of it."Cleaning the bathrooms and windows, which are always a problem in the winter, is part of the job. "At the end of the day, you get a feeling of peace," says Umberto. It's a feeling he has had many times, and he likes to keep it for the end of the day. "After a day like this, you feel so alive! You feel that you can take care of anything. I always say that in life there are a lot of people who think they are in charge. It's really not like that. All we care about is being alive. That's it!"When a man feels alive at the end of the day, he is not in charge of anything. The spirit of man is always the same. The world around us is an echo of what we really are. The world is a reflection of our love, but this reflection is a reflection of ourselves. In the end, man is as happy as he is a little confused, and he can only be happy in his own way.With a single ray of light, I have found the world.There is no love without freedom.**I love the day to be lived**.—Ivan Illich**1951**# **THE ARTIST SPIRIT****The artist soul is the most important thing in the world.** A man can make a	0
Evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades-long fight against gay marriage, softening their tone and recalibrating their goals. In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage among their top priorities. Instead, they’ve expressed support for traditional marriage and even more strongly denounced the Supreme Court’s ruling striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Their shifting stances reflect a broader retreat from their aggressive stance.In public, however, evangelicals are still fighting. They are waging a highly visible campaign to pass laws that protect traditional marriage nationwide. In more private sessions, evangelicals are trying to win over fellow conservatives or at least those who have become dispirited by the public spats.A key evangelical organizer, Matt Barber, a pastor and founder of a nonprofit group called the Family Research Council, is pushing to get the group to take a strong stand on a gay-marriage ban, a position that will inevitably alienate some on the group’s board.Barber’s argument is that the government should protect traditional marriage. But after seeing gay-marriage opponents lose their fight for the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court, the pastor and Family Research Council officials say they need to move on.“We’re not going to stand in the way of that movement. There are real consequences to taking the fight to the judicial system,” says Barber, who helped found the group in 1988 and led its first statewide campaigns for a gay-marriage ban.“We have to make a choice. We either have to be completely comfortable with gay marriage, or we have to stand in the way.”The gay lobby is fighting tooth and nail to get the Family Research Council, along with numerous other conservative activists and organizations, to take a stand on a gay-marriage ban.Gay-marriage opponents say if conservatives don’t stand up, they will lose the battle over the Defense of Marriage Act, a 2003 law that was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 as illegal DOMA.Last month, the court upheld the law in its entirety, ruling that the Justice Department had no business making a different legal determination for one state than another, let alone in the middle of a four-month trial. The court left in place the portion of DOMA that	0
Singer Carrie Underwood has gotten engaged to hockey player beau Mike Fisher, her spokesperson confirmed to CNN. "I'm happy to confirm that Carrie Underwood is engaged to Mike Fisher, and the couple couldn't be happier," said Jessie Schmidt. "No wedding date has been set at this time." Fisher plays for the Ottawa Senators hockey team in Canada. During an appearance on Ellen Degeneres' talk show in November, Underwood joked with the host that the relationship -- then almost a year long -- was the longest she had ever had. "I joke and say my dogs are the longest relationship ever," Underwood said. The couple have been enjoying a long distance relationship and Underwood demurred at the idea of living together. "No, call me old-fashioned," Underwood said during her interview with Ellen. "He's there. I'm here. We're both doing our thing and it's good. The next guy I move in with will be my hubby." Underwood, who has risen from being a former winner of "American Idol" to a country music superstar,  has been linked in the past with Dallas Cowboys football player Tony Romo and "Gossip Girl" actor Chace Crawford.	1
Rose Mary Sabo Brown spent just 30 days with her new husband, Army Spec. Leslie Sabo Jr., before he shipped out to fight in Vietnam. But from that month together in 1969 grew a lifetime of  one woman's longing for a different partner, a man who filled a void in her life.Leslie Sabo Brown spent just 30 days with his new wife, Army Specialist Kathleen Sabo, before she was shipped out to Vietnam. From then on, the two would be apart for more than half a century.Sabo Brown wanted so much for herself: a partner, two children, a marriage with a decent chance of a happy life.But Army Sergeant Leslie Sabo Sr., also stationed in the service, was far from what her mother had hoped for.The Army had been her only future, her mother said, and it wouldn't take very long for her to find out it was full of disappointments.But the girl in the pictures she saw in her mind was the woman who would one day be her mother, the woman who would comfort her when her mother became sick and send her off on a tour of duty so she could return for good.The girl was only 19 when her mother died two weeks after the birth of her first child, and Kathleen Sabo Brown was now going to be the only daughter.When she returned to Fort Hood after two years in the National Guard, she would have to leave Leslie and three-year-old Michael Sabo behind."She was only 19," said Leslie, 53. "She'd had a tough life, and it didn't make sense to me at the time why she was just sitting there and not going down into the Guard."That was then, that was life under the Army, and Leslie Sabo wasn't going to change it.Kathleen Sabo Brown was now 17 and would be heading into the world as Leslie Sabo and Michael's mother, and she was going to have to leave them behind.The Army had its rules, and no one could travel away from base without permission. No one, not even on vacation, could leave the Fort Hood area without permission."I remember going out the front gate to leave to get on my motorcycle," said Leslie, who asked not to be identified because no one in her family knew where she was.

First came word of a woman stabbed. Then screams. Then gunshots. But the full story of Thursday's gruesome beheading at an Oklahoma food processing plant -- especially why it happened -- is still waiting to be told. One day later, there are tears for Colleen Hufford, the 54-year-old woman whose head was severed. There are prayers for 43-year-old Traci Johnson, who is in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of "numerous wounds," according to police. And there are questions about 30-year-old Alton Alexander Nolen, the man who authorities say attacked them both and might have gone after more people if not for the company's CEO, also an off-duty reserve sheriff's deputy, who confronted and shot him twice. Answers may come from Nolen himself. As of 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), he was "coming out of a sedation" at a hospital and investigators planned "to attempt to begin interviewing him as soon as he was coherent enough to understand what was going on," according to Sgt. Jeremy Lewis of the Moore Police Department. Here's what they do know: The attack happened very soon after Nolen learned he'd lost his job. Nolen had been incarcerated until March 2013, for possession of a controlled substance, escaping confinement and resisting an officer. And he had been trying to convert co-workers to Islam. Lewis also said there may be other information about Nolen's past, that he could not reveal, that might help explain the incident, and that the FBI had been called in to dig deeper into Nolen's background. "Once we started investigating this initially, and started finding some of the things that he had been involved in, some of the things that he had been saying, we immediately contacted the FBI and got them involved," Lewis told CNN's Erin Burnett. CEO/reserve sheriff's deputy stops attack The large, rectangular Vaughan Foods processing plant looks like many others from the outside: a no-frills design, nondescript front entrance and loading bays out back. But Friday, there was nothing normal about it. Police cars were everywhere, and uniformed officers walked the property. Some citizens stood outside watching, putting their arms around each other and trying to make sense of the horror the day before. Some of this drama could be heard in a 911 call released Friday by the city of Moore.	1
Edward Itta, a powerful Eskimo leader, looks out at the icy Arctic Ocean stretched out under a fuzzy orange sun that refuses to set this time of year. "This is our garden," said the former mayor of the North Slope Borough, a county-style government covering an area as big as Wyoming. Itta's garden, the Arctic Ocean, is filled with the whales, seals, walruses and fish the Inupiat Eskimos still need to survive. But many Inupiats think "their garden" is being threatened by an international oil rush to get at what may be a treasure trove of more than 25 billion barrels of crude. Itta's lynchpin decision on whether to fight Shell Alaska's efforts to begin exploratory drilling in the Arctic was among the most difficult of his 67 years. Running his hands along the edge of a traditional boat -- much like the Inupiat people have used for thousands of years to hunt whale -- Itta remembers environmental oil disasters such as 1989's Exxon Valdez and the Deepwater Horizon. But he also talks about the critical economic needs of the region's 9,500 people -- 11% of whom live below the poverty line. "I struggled with myself and prayed a lot," says Itta. The whole world is watching. Just ask Bob Reiss, an eco-journalist and author of "The Eskimo and the Oil Man." "If Shell really hits it big this summer, I think things will heat up even more," Reiss told CNN. "It will be an undersea gold rush for oil." Shortly before Itta left office after serving a maximum term, he reached a compromise with Shell that opened the door for drilling to begin later this year. Other officials have struggled with competing fears and desires linked to the promise of oil riches. Opinion: Why we should look toward the Arctic What's interesting about Itta's shift toward his final decision is how far he traveled. In his own words, Itta moved from "hell no" to "OK." "Not only no ... but HELL no!" Itta emphasizes. "Even one time I said, 'I'm going to fight this, and they will have to do it over my dead body.' " In this age of polarized politics and unwavering ideology, you have to wonder: what was that internal journey like?	1
More than 340,000 gamers from across Europe converged in this quaint German city last month to get their first hands-on with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One consoles and to preview an assortment of new games. The occasion was Gamescom, the massive video gaming show that attracted over 600 exhibitors from upwards of 80 countries, all of whom set up booths in 10 massive halls that featured over 1.4 million square feet of space. It was like E3 and Comic-Con, only much bigger. Big companies like Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts kicked off the festivities with press conferences that featured exclusive announcements, including the November 15 PS4 launch date and new games such as "The Sims 4." Europe plays an important role in the global gaming ecosystem, thanks to the success of such European companies as Rovio Entertainment ("Angry Birds"), DICE ("Battlefield 4") and TT Games ("The LEGO Movie Game"). According to Peter Warman, founder of video-game research firm Newzoo, European consumers will contribute 23% of the $70.4 billion global video game market this year. "The most talked-about companies over the past year are European," said Warman. "Companies like SuperCell ("Clash of Clans"), Wargaming ("World of Tanks"), Mojang ("Minecraft") and King ("Candy Crush") will bring in a combined revenue of more than $1.5 billion this year." Next-generation gaming was a huge focus this year, but the current crop of consoles still have a lot of life left in them. And the PC, which has always been strong in Europe, remains a force as well. Here are five games that stood out from the very crowded booths of Gamescom 2013. 'Fighter Within' -- Ubisoft/Daoka; Xbox One; Fall 2013 Developer Daoka is making the most of the new Xbox One Kinect technology with this fighting game, which you control by moving your arms and legs. Thanks to the enhanced motion sensors and tracking capabilities, players' moves are represented on a one-to-one basis within the game. This means that every punch, kick and counter in the real world will be faithfully replicated.	1
President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100  million.The campaign's June fundraising total was $68 million, a three percent increase from the previous month. The campaign said it received about $6.1 million in individual donations, and the average donation was $84.10, a slight increase from the average donation in May.The campaign also raised $20.5 million from 556,000 individual and corporate donors.The campaign reported on Sunday that it had raised $21.7 million since the Republican National Convention in Tampa. On June 5, the campaign reported that it had raised $37.5 million and it had $50.5 million under management.In April, the campaign was forced to spend more than $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over President Obama's use of taxpayer-funded private jets while in office. The campaign also agreed to pay $12 million to former government employees who say they were improperly dismissed. The campaign said the cash-strapped campaign will use a portion of the cash to re-invest in the campaign.The Obama re-election campaign says Romney's campaign is relying "on their own money and donors who have already donated." They're claiming, they say, "it's not like we're raising huge amounts of money with no one buying ads."Obama campaign spokesperson Lis Smith said, "We will continue to show support to our supporters. Our record of achievement remains strong, and so do the people we represent."The Associated Press reports:Obama campaign officials say they are running an unprecedented $27 million advertising campaign on the airwaves and on social media and online to counter a negative image Romney is portraying in a debate Wednesday night.The Obama campaign and its allies say those ads are designed to counter what they characterize as Romney's false claims that they are hurting the economy or trying to “out-spend” Obama. Romney says the Romney campaign is relying on their own money and donors who have already donated, a claim they vehemently deny.The campaign's ads are mostly negative and include attacks from Romney surrogates like former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.Romney campaign officials say they won't spend more than the $2.5 million they have already pledged.

Coca cultivation and cocaine production have decreased in Colombia but increased in Bolivia and Peru, the United Nations reported. Workers help eradicate coca plantations in northwest Colombia in May. Colombian cultivation was down 18 percent, and production decreased 28 percent in 2008, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime said in a report issued Friday. But cultivation increased 6 percent in Bolivia and 4.5 percent in Peru, the report said. Likewise, production went up 9 percent in Bolivia and 4.1 percent in Peru. "The increases for Bolivia and Peru show a trend in the wrong direction," said Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. drug office. Much of the decline in Colombia resulted from the manual eradication of 237 acres of coca, an increase of 44 percent over 2007, and the spraying of another 328 acres with herbicide, the U.N. said. The production level is at a 10-year-low, the report said, and the cultivation amount is down to 2004 to 2006 levels. "This is a remarkable achievement," Costa said in a release. "It means that more coca bush was eradicated in Colombia than was grown in all of Bolivia and Peru." The value of coca leaf in Colombia is decreasing, making it less attractive for farmers -- 20,000 fewer households grew coca in 2008 than in 2007, a decrease of 26 percent. The drug trade also is being disrupted, the report said. In Colombia, the U.N. said, authorities seized 200 tons of cocaine in 2008, a 57 percent increase in seizures over 2007, the report said. Peru reported an 86 percent increase in seizures of coca base and a 100 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine. Bolivia, likewise, reported a 45 percent uptick in seizures of coca base and a 145 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine. "Cocaine supply is shrinking, as is demand in major markets of North America while cocaine use in Western Europe has stopped growing," Costa said. "This may explain why prices are up, and purity is down. This may also explain why cartels are becoming so violent."	1
At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink. State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from 任天堂, a Chinese street snack business of unknown provenance. State-owned media outlet Xinhua reported on Saturday that it had no way of tracking the pigs' origins or the owner. According to the Shanghai Agriculture University, the pigs most likely came from the city's western suburbs.China's official Xinhua newspaper reported three days of deadly mass killing at Shanghai's Qingpu River that coincided with heavy rainfall in the eastern province of Jiangsu and in the surrounding areas. Xinhua said on Saturday that the waterway was safe to drink in light of the latest scientific investigations.Since Friday, reports of poisoned water, fish and dead birds have continued to pour in. More than 2,800 dead pigs have been counted in the Qingpu River so far, Xinhua reported."The authorities are doing good work to stop the pollution of the river, yet more dead pigs cannot be buried in this river," a local resident told Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper on Saturday.The Qingpu River runs south of Shanghai's main commercial center, where some residents have been forced to drink from their taps for the past week. The water source has also been contaminated with untreated sewage, Xinhua reported.Rescuers said Saturday that one person had died in the waterway.China is seeking to build a massive new port and a floating dock to accommodate a giant passenger carrier to join its existing five modern freighters. Beijing plans to construct the new port to accommodate 1 million container ships to replace a current port with a capacity of only 600,000, according to a recent report from the Institute of Defense Studies.Xinhua also said Saturday the dead pigs were being tested for chemical and biological contaminants.Beijing is also working on a 2.6 Billion yuan ($400 million) project to build a floating dock to accommodate the new container port. As the number of container ships grow, the floating dock will be able to expand. Officials are hoping to receive the construction permit in August.A container ship in operation off the coast of Fujian province has also been found to be illegally dumping untreated sewage into the sea. The ship was found to	0
Like misery, failure loves company. Look at the immigration debate and how both liberals and conservatives -- and elected officials in both parties -- bungle it. President Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy. But now that he appears to be iced, he's turning his attention to immigration reform. The focus is on the Senate, where immigration reform has been stalled for months because of the obstructionism of Senate Republicans, including their leader, John McCain. But Obama has decided to take his ball, and is now demanding a legislative showdown with the Senate GOP. This raises many questions for our readers and readership. Here are five of them:1) What's the rush? Obama is up for re-election next year. The most important issue for Democratic voters is the economy and economic growth -- the two reasons Republicans and conservatives are so focused on immigration reform, and on repealing the health care bill. On the issue of health care, Republicans are only trying to repeal the legislation, not its essential provisions.2) Is there anyone in the Obama administration who wants to compromise on immigration reform, or is this all his own plan? It is almost certainly true that people at the White House are being pressured by the president to compromise. But if the president is determined to get a legislative showdown with the GOP, this may mean that he is simply unwilling to compromise.3) Does the White House actually want a legislative showdown? Or does the president want to create problems for the GOP that they can use to force a bill to the floor? Perhaps the president and his team would prefer to get something on the agenda that will help the economy, and which can be signed into law quickly, rather than a bill that forces a painful debate. Perhaps Obama and his team see the GOP as the obstacle on the path to comprehensive immigration reform.4) Why make immigration reform such a high priority now? Because the GOP is in charge of the Senate.5) What is the president's strategy?If there are two things that are certain in Washington, it's that the president and his team will do something -- anything -- just to get something done. There is no shortage of blame to go around. But the White House wants to get a legislative showdown with the Senate GOP. This is just not reasonable. It might create difficulties for the president's agenda during an election year -- including a backlash by Hispanic voters.There's a chance that the president may	0
A funeral took place in London Friday for Mark Duggan, the father of four whose death after his cab was stopped by armed police led to protests that expanded into four days of rioting. A horse-drawn cortege processed through the streets from his parents' home in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham to the church in nearby Wood Green where the ceremony was held, with many mourners on hand. Duggan, 29, died on August 4 from a gunshot to the chest after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped the cab that was carrying him. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is still investigating the circumstances around his death and said Thursday that it "is far from reaching any conclusions." A peaceful protest in Tottenham two days after his death turned violent and rioting spread to other parts of London and other English cities over the following days. Michael Jarrett, 47, from Tottenham was among hundreds who turned out to pay their respects to Duggan and his family. In 1985, Jarrett's mother, Cynthia, died after four police officers searched her home in Tottenham's Broadwater Farm housing project. Anger over her death sparked the Broadwater Farm riots, in which a policeman died. The area's reputation was tainted for years. Speaking outside the church where Duggan's funeral was held, Jarrett told CNN little had changed in the decades since then. "The ethnic minorities are still being mistreated," he said. "I don't think a lot changed, the mood in the area is one of regret and sorrow. But there is still a lot of mistrust where the police are concerned." He said politicians who blamed people who "just want to loot, steal and riot" for the unrest that broke out last month need to look at the underlying problems behind such behavior. "I actually condemn the looting and the burning of buildings," he said, "but I understand the situation behind and the frustration and anger behind it. That I do understand. Fully." Yvonne Collail, 47, from Tottenham told CNN she was concerned that the recent trouble in Tottenham had made everyone less safe and meant the police would have to carry guns, which is unusual in Britain. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement beforehand that a senior officer had "met with the parents and family of Mark Duggan and discussed the policing arrangements" for the funeral.	1
With a short statement, China's tallest superstar Wednesday made it official that he has quit playing basketball, after weeks of intense media speculation on his future. "I will end my athletic career and formally retire from the game of basketball," Yao Ming, who turns 31 in September, told a packed press conference in his hometown. The Shanghai native, who stands at 7 feet and 6 inches (2.29 meters), blamed persistent injuries for cutting short his decorated career on the court. "At the end of last year, I once again had a stress fracture in my left foot and had to sit out of basketball," he said. "Since then, like many friends who cared about me, I waited and hoped that I could return." China bids farewell to Yao The nicknamed "Little Giant" was signed by the Houston Rockets in 2002 as the top overall pick of the National Basketball Association in North America. Since then Yao has scored an average of 19 points per game and been voted an NBA All-Star player eight times, turning himself to one of the most successful overseas players in the league. Over the past two years, however, foot and ankle injuries forced him to miss the 2009-2010 season and sit out most of last season after only five games. Despite the recent setback, the former Houston Rockets center made a special point in English about thanking his adopted hometown. "Nine years ago, I came to Houston as a young, tall, skinny player," he said. "The entire city and the team changed me to a grown man -- not only as a basketball player but also I had my daughter there." Yao's one-year-old daughter Amy, smiling at a wall of flashing cameras, almost outshone her famous father when the whole family -- including Yao's wife and parents -- took center stage. Her potential birthplace was a contentious topic in China last year, as supporters debated the implications of their hero, who had led the national team into world championships and the Olympics, becoming the father of an American citizen. At the press event, amid high praises from sports officials, Yao fielded the rapid-fire questions from journalists -- ranging from his most memorable game to his daughter's first "Daddy" -- with his usual brevity and dry humor. "On earth," he responded when a local reporter asked him where he planned to live in retirement.	1
Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed reports he is about to quit the English Premier League champions. Newspaper speculation on Monday claimed the Italian was on the verge of walking out of Stamford Bridge Â The Italian, who is a four-time Champions League victor and his club's best manager, was last week quoted as saying he was "in the twilight of my career"."What's happened is complete rubbish," he said on Sunday. "I have been at Chelsea for 20 years, and I have the full backing of the club. If something happens, I'll take it in the right spirit. This time there is no truth to anything I've said. I'm sure that even now, during the night, Chelsea are discussing my future. If they decide everything will go on as normal, I will remain."But I will not go away until something really dramatic happens. Until I'm told I have to go. If I stay, we will be in the same situation as we were last year. I will not leave until something really serious has happened." The story came the day after the board of Chelsea said Chelsea's new chairman and co-owner Roman Abramovich (Pictured: Chelsea fans react as Ancelotti departs for Manchester United)However, in a statement on the club's website, chairman Bruce Buck denied speculation regarding Ancelotti: "There is absolutely no truth to the rumour that we have approached Carlo Ancelotti to end his relationship with Chelsea."The Italian was interviewed by BBC Sport's Huw Jones on the day he stepped down as England captain. "I have done a lot over this period of time," he said. "Obviously the Premier League is the biggest league in the world and one of the biggest clubs in the world - it's a fantastic experience."He added, "Last year, I was captain of the national team and I did what I could to help the team. When people say you can go through the dressing room only to say things are going well, to me it's not going well. I went through the dressing room with all my heart and I feel that people can see that."That's why I've decided to step down and that's why I'm leaving. But I'm not going away until there is something serious. I am the only person who can decide what is going on at Chelsea and I'll be the only one to decide that."	0
A day before the Nobel committee honors an imprisoned Chinese dissident with its peace prize, China ratched up the rhetoric calling the award "an interference" in its internal affairs. "The Nobel committee has to admit they are in the minority," said  Zhang Qingli, a spokesman for the Nobel Committee. "It was the Chinese government, which has always opposed our right of self-determination."A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman was far more direct. "We will not accept the Nobel Peace Prize."There is reason to question the sincerity of China’s protest. The organization of the 2004 prize was controlled by the Swedish government. The committee had also accepted the 2008 prize, but it had gone to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. And the 2011 award went to the Tibetan leader Dalai Lama -- not a Chinese.The Nobel Prize Committee’s secretary general has made public statements that have been at odds with the committee’s own statements in the past. “The Nobel Peace Prize serves peace and human dignity,” said committee secretary general Gunnar Myrdal in October of last year. “It is not an award for China and does not affect China’s internal affairs.”The Nobel committee itself has made a similar argument, arguing that it is “not a peace prize, but it is a peace and human rights prize.” That was in an interview with CBS News in November, when the committee honored one of the prize’s recipients with its Peace and Freedom Prize. “I don’t see how it is possible to judge a person solely on the basis of his actions,” Nobel committee secretary general Gunnar Myrdal told CBS. “I think the Nobel Peace Prize Prize is there for people to recognize good intentions and human endeavor.”That was less than a year after the Nobel committee had named Liu Xiaobo the recipient of the Peace and Freedom Prize, a prize awarded by the committee to an individual who “has done special things for peace and freedom.”The Nobel Committee has a history of making statements that have been at odds with their own actions, sometimes in front of the public, and sometimes behind closed doors. It is the opposite of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Swedish Committee, which are non-partisan in that they both award prizes to individuals for their humanistic accomplishments.The Norwegian Nobel Committee has	0

U.S. President Barack Obama does not foresee a scenario of "American boots on the ground in Syria," telling reporters Friday that it would not be good for the United States or for that county. "As a general rule, I don't rule things out as  for the reason that people tell me I will be the first president in history to be responsible for American boots on the ground in another country," he said at a presidential news conference. "And it's going to be very difficult for any administration to do that, but it wouldn't be good for our country."Obama's comments in Chicago came before the head of the House intelligence committee warned of unspecified consequences if Congress approved the president's plan to fight ISIS. The House voted Thursday on the measure, after the White House warned that U.S. ground troops in the Middle East would not be required.The White House told reporters "of course" it is not planning for a ground war. Its only concerns are that "people would like to see" U.S. troops in Syria, Obama said. Obama's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes also said Friday that a resolution to authorize U.S. military action in Syria "would not make that a possibility."House Speaker John Boehner said the House is trying to figure out what the White House is actually doing. "I want to know what is being proposed," he said at a news conference.After the House vote, Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday's vote "demonstrates how difficult it is to get anything done in Washington."The White House and many conservatives have pushed for a military strike against Assad's government. But even though Obama has hinted he might strike Assad before the House vote, his top national security aides said Friday he will not."The administration has made clear it does not want to see US military intervention in Syria, and that's why we're taking our time" there, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said after the vote. "But we remain open to the possibility of using a limited air campaign, in concert with a broad range of partners, to degrade and destroy ISIL."Earnest said Obama would prefer "to work with Congress on this issue.""We have made clear to Congress that we hope to avoid a precipitous action, and remain open to a variety of options as we seek to degrade and destroy ISIL's ability to conduct future attacks,"	0
Arguably the best fake newsman on television, comedian Stephen Colbert knows how to deliver a one-liner. But his invitation to testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on immigration was the real joke. Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited Colbert's "ability to Ã¢ÂÂtell Ã¢ÂÂem the truth,Ã¢ÂÂ and told him that he was Ã¢ÂÂa very courageous young man.Ã¢ÂÂWell, Colbert got what he wanted, and he got a chance to demonstrate courage by testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. What he didn't expect was that Pelosi would put him on the House floor to be the star of a live, national television show. Here's what you need to know about Colbert's attempt to testify before the House Judiciary Committee:1. Colbert asked if he could testify before the hearing.Colbert received permission from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to attend the hearing. But Pelosi was so enthusiastic that she told Colbert he could testify if he wanted. "When you put your face on TV, it's great. You can show her [Pelosi] what you look like and the people that you know, and that can help her understand why you are there. And the people there are going to want to see you, and you want to hear from them," Pelosi told Colbert.Colbert, an admitted Democrat, didn't take it as a gift to testify before Congress, and didn't appreciate Pelosi's invitation to be "the face of America" on national television.2. Colbert wasn't allowed in the hearing room first.Colbert's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee was first reported by the Washington Examiner. Colbert was permitted to go into the hearing room, but House Judiciary Committee members were concerned about getting him there because they wanted to be present when he testified. It took Pelosi and other panel members convincing her colleagues to allow him to testify.On Tuesday, the day before the hearing was to begin, Colbert's wife, Ann Curry, wrote, "This is a great opportunity for our family to experience the history of the House for the first time because we are the first to be invited by Speaker Pelosi, the first to be given a spot on the floor, and last to get our own spot on the wall."Colbert was allowed to enter	0
Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when their plane crashed on the way to a recruiting trip in Arkansas, university officials said Friday. Former Oklahoma ernion coach Billy Gillispie, who is suspected of being behind the flight, was also killed.The victims were en route to the University of Arkansas for what was supposed to be a recruiting trip to Arkansas. The plane crashed into a field and exploded. All 27 people on board, including the two coaches' families, died.A University of Oklahoma student was charged with capital murder in the case, but his attorneys have asked that the case against him be sealed until his trial. Prosecutors said they had not ruled out the possibility of trying the case as a hate crime.More than 100 women and men were gathered in front of the University of Oklahoma's football stadium on Thursday night for a candlelight vigil, demanding a formal punishment for the person who killed two women and injured nine fans on a college football field last week.The student, whose name was not released, is being held on $1 million bond and is scheduled to appear in court Saturday."This is a tragedy and it's an important moment for our university community," University spokesman Terry Mohawk said. "We're going to honor the victims and their loved ones, and express our sorrow. We're going to say what our plans are for the investigation and for the future."The two victims were former OU student-athletes, and the other victim was a fan attending the game. All six died."This tragedy is completely unacceptable in the world of college athletics," Mohawk said.At an earlier news conference, OU Athletic Director Chuck Ewing called the deaths a "tragic accident." Ewing said the university is working with the national governing body of collegiate athletics to determine what actions it will take."Our focus and our intent is to seek justice for the students, for the coaches and for all of the victims who lost their lives in this terrible accident," Ewing said. He said the university is "in the process of gathering all available information on the accident and the circumstances that led to this tragic event."The two coaches were heading to the campus of the University of Arkansas for a recruiting trip to visit the schools. Officials said they were headed for a recruiting trip and trip to a recruiting destination.	0
A police officer jailed on a first-degree murder charge in a two-state shooting rampage was on his computer at the time of shootings and could not have committed them, prosecutors said Tuesday evening. Brian E. Dorian, 37, was _____ the first of three officers wounded in the Dec. 5 attack on a Florida gas station, but he had no gun, and his attorney argued that the defendant, who has been on the force for 15 years, likely knew what was happening.Lawyers for the officers say they plan to keep Dorian away from the media from now on and have asked the judge to limit his access to his attorney and lawyers for the victims, as well as to his brother and sister, with whom he has been living. "Mr. Dorian is a responsible professional and was at work the night of the shooting," said Michael Gerstein, the lawyer for Dorian's wife, Cynthia.Lawyers for the three officers say they have evidence that shows the officers were not in a "consistent state," and they want any jurors who would find them guilty of lesser offenses to be dismissed.The three officers who took part in the encounter with Mr. Dorian — two on the scene and one after the shooting — were all assigned to the same shift and had been together previously.The state says it plans to seek the death penalty against all three officers, but it makes clear that the jury will have to deliberate carefully to determine their fate. This trial would be the first to involve multiple officers in a fatal shooting.The two officers who were on the scene during the shooting said they were driving toward the scene with their lights and sirens on. At one point, they got out of their vehicle and joined other officers from the scene in surrounding Mr.When Mr. Dorian got back into his truck, one officer fired shots, hitting him several times. The two officers who were at the scene on the scene, Thomas Gaffey and Gary Nettles, testified that they heard the gunshots and saw Mr. Dorian jump from the passenger side of his truck, drop to the ground and get back up. They said that after firing the shots, Mr. Dorian walked toward them."I heard him say to me, 'I need to get away from here,' " Mr. Gaffey testified. "I think I saw him run around to the other side of the truck	0
Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., once a rising Democratic star whose political fortunes imploded over the use of campaign finances to support lavish personal spending, was sentenced to 30 months in prison on Wednesday. "I misled myself over the amount of money that I should have reported," Jackson told U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in the Central District of California, where he was convicted of seven counts of tax evasion and one count of making a false statement to a federally insured institution.In a statement, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that the sentence is a "deterrent to others of a different political persuasion."She added, "The Court commends the defendant for his cooperation and wishes him the best of luck in the future." Jackson will report to prison in July, and if successful at his parole hearing, he will be immediately deported back to the U.S.Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to charges of wire fraud and making a false statement to a federally-insured institution in a case that prosecutors called a "giant feather in the cap of the federal corruption program."According to Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the indictment charges Jackson with accepting illegal campaign contributions, then using campaign resources to pay for personal expenses.The former Democratic presidential candidate, who was once elected to the House of Representatives, served as the U.S. Attorney for Northern California.

North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its eastern coast Monday, the second such launch in less than a week, according to the South Korean Defense  Ministry and South Korea's top military officer.The launches, which reportedly were witnessed by people on both sides of the border, were not aimed at a specific military target. According to South Korea's Defense Ministry, the missiles flew 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers (2,800 to 3,700 miles) as far as Guam, though they failed to reach their target, which is unclear.The South Korean government has called on North Korea to abandon its missile tests in order to build trust with the United States and increase pressure on Pyongyang."The North has made great efforts in recent years to improve its missile capabilities, but these tests have been conducted without any real change in the behavior of the North," the United States said in a statement.The Pentagon said the latest missile tests did not violate U.N. sanctions.According to the Defense Ministry in Seoul, North Korea launched two short-range Scud-type missiles from the eastern port city of Wonsan at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT Monday). Seoul said it is still analyzing the two missiles.The launch followed last week's detonation of a Hwasong-12 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which had the longest flight path in North Korea's arsenal, which reached a height of 2,744 kilometers (1,770 miles).North Korea has conducted missile tests twice this year, once in April, and again in May, South Korea's Unification Ministry said Monday.Pyongyang has conducted an impressive array of missile launches this year, and has shown an increasing interest in building up the capability of its ballistic missiles. According to South Korea's Defense Ministry, the North fired two short-range missiles off its eastern coast in May and June, both times from Wonsan.Last week's launch of the Hwasong-12 ICBM into the North's southern direction was the first since North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile test in April, which South Korean officials said measured a height of 2,770 kilometers (1,835 miles).The United States condemned the latest launch as a provocative act, and said it will continue to urge the North to halt actions that target South Korea and the	0
Environmentalists in Vietnam were ebullient this week after remote cameras in a forest reserve snapped pictures of a live saola, one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. At most a few hundred -- and as few as a couple dozen -- of the animals are thought to exist. Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the "Asian unicorn." That moniker comes despite the fact it has two closely spaced parallel horns. "These are the most important wild animal photographs taken in Asia, and perhaps the world, in at least the past decade," said William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, in a World Wildlife Fund press release. Scientists discover new species in Australian rainforest "This is an historic moment in Vietnam's efforts to protect our extraordinary biodiversity," Dang Dinh Nguyen, deputy head of the country's Quang Nam Forest Protection Department, said in the release. The picture of the animal was taken in September in a reserve in the Central Annamite Mountains and announced by the WWF on Tuesday. 441 species discovered in Amazon since 2010 Van Ngoc Thinh, WWF-Vietnam's country director, called the picture "a breath-taking discovery." "When our team first looked at the photos we couldn't believe our eyes. Saola are the holy grail for Southeast Asian conservationists," Van said in a press release. The saola, which is a relative of cattle but looks like an antelope, was first discovered in 1992 in forests along the Vietnam-Laos border. A WWF survey team found a skull of the animal in a hunter's home. In Vietnam, a saola was last seen in the wild in 1998. In Laos, a remote camera snapped a picture of one in the wild in 1999. And in 2010, Laotian villagers captured a saola that died before word got to researchers. Olinguito: The newest rare mammal species There are no saola in captivity. Environmentalists said Wednesday the pictures show that efforts to save the saola are working.	1
In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 2009, a gunshot rang out that resonated around the country. At 22, Bay Area resident Oscar Grant was fatally shot by a transit police officer at the Fruitvale train station in Oakland, California, after being detained with other passengers on the platform following reports of a fight. Grant was unarmed, and the incident sparked waves of protests in the months that followed. The incident is chronicled in "Fruitvale Station," an independent film, scheduled for release on July 12, that tells the story of the last day of Grant's life. For the film's first-time director, Ryan Coogler, the motivation to tell "Fruitvale Station" was deeply personal. "If Oscar were alive today, he'd be the same age as me right now, he'd be 27," Coogler, who grew up in the Bay Area, told CNN at the movie's New York premiere. "When it happened, it really affected me. That's also something that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, losing friends to gun violence. I've seen lives cut short too soon." He adds, "What gets glossed over is that we're human beings too, like everybody else, young African-American males. Our humanity can often be found in our relationships with the people who are closest to us, and those relations aren't often shown in headlines and whatever types of media you see us portrayed in. I hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film, and have a little bit of insight." Court upholds conviction in California subway shooting The issue of young lives being cut off violently and unnecessarily early is what drew notable cast members Michael B. Jordan and Octavia Spencer to the film. Jordan can easily recall the 2009 Fruitvale station shooting, and he told CNN he feels a sense of responsibility to revive Grant's legacy. "The opportunity for me to play Oscar Grant, I mean I just had to jump at it. I felt a serious responsibility to play that role," Jordan said. "Especially for the family, knowing one day his daughter's going to watch this movie, and his mom, and the rest of his family and friends. I just want to do him justice." To Spencer, the story of Grant's death is representative of an ongoing societal problem.	1
White House officials and some members of Congress reacted strongly Sunday to news that insurance giant AIG had intended to pay out $165 million in bonuses and compensation.  The company has received at least $170 billion in federal bailout money. In a letter to the White House, AIG Chairman Edward Liddy, shown here in December, vows to curb bonuses. Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or "retention payments" -- by at least 30 percent. That did little to temper outrage at the initial plan, however. In a letter Sunday to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold urged the Obama administration to explore "legal options" to prevent the millions in AIG payouts. "I write to ask why any bonuses would be legally required, given the company's abysmal performance," says Feingold, D-Wisconsin. Feingold asked whether the bonuses could be canceled or recouped from recipients, and whether the administration will sue AIG executives for breaching their duties to shareholders "There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months, but what's happened at AIG is the most outrageous," Lawrence Summers, head of the National Economic Council, told ABC's "This Week." "What that company did, the way it was not regulated, the way no one was watching, what's proved necessary, it is outrageous." And on "Fox News Sunday," White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was "really upset by the news." "He stepped in and berated them, got them to reduce the bonuses following every legal means he has to do this," Goolsbee said. In a letter to Geithner, obtained Saturday by CNN, AIG Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy said his company was taking steps to limit compensation in AIG Financial Products -- the British-based unit responsible for issuing the risky credit default swaps that have brought the company to the brink of collapse. The default swaps amount to insurance against losses from bad loans, which have increased dramatically since the U.S. housing boom peaked.	1
World leaders, many reeling from a year marked by global economic freefall and a growing threat from global warming and nuclear proliferation, exhorted one another Wednesday to work together to meet those challenges. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday. In his first remarks to the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama noted that he took office last January "at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust." He then sought to distance himself from the policies of his predecessor, noting that he had prohibited the use of torture, ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay to be closed and has been working to create a framework to combat terrorism "within the rule of law." Obama called on world leaders to work together to effect the change needed. "No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together," he said. He vowed to pursue an agreement with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, to combat nuclear smuggling and theft and to support the non-proliferation treaty.  Watch President Obama speak to the United Nations » He identified North Korea and Iran as countries whose governments "threaten to take us down this dangerous slope" and said he is committed to diplomacy in persuading them to live up to their obligations. Obama called for "more progress" in the Middle East. "We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements," he said to applause. Obama left no doubt that he believes the danger posed by global warming is a real one. "Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred. If we continue down our current course, every member of this assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders," he said. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also called for world unity in confronting crises -- such as climate change and food shortages -- but he expressed ire at the world body and the United States.  Watch Gadhafi's rant at the U.N. » In a 96-minute, rambling address in his first appearance before the United Nations, Gadhafi broached conspiracy theories, urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure and the actions of the Security Council itself.	1
The Supreme Court's decision Monday on same-sex marriage brought the issue back into the political mix less than a month before the midterm elections. Deciding not to weigh in on the debate, the high court refused to hear cases in five  states: Virginia, Michigan, Hawaii, Oklahoma and Utah. The justices left untouched the case of the Little Rock school district that had challenged the constitutionality of its gay-rights policy, because there are no current plans to put that case before the court.In Oklahoma, same-sex marriage became a referendum issue again, with a Republican candidate challenging the state's ban on gay marriage, and with the state's voters saying that they want no more bans on gay marriage.The high court's decision in two cases brought by gay-rights advocates, Lawrence v. Texas and Hollingsworth v. Perry, took a dim view of states that ban gay marriage, either by constitutional amendment that says marriage is only between a man and a woman, or by laws banning gays from being married in public.Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority in Hollingsworth, wrote that the Constitution's guarantee of due process is limited by the state's interest in banning gay marriage. This decision, he wrote, should prevent legislatures from "forcing their own views on the people of this country."And that is why the high court's decision to not give gay marriage, or gay marriage bans, a hearing in the first place, is so puzzling. Because the Supreme Court already ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects against forced marriage. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the dissent that the right to marry a same-sex partner, or a married same-sex partner, should not be considered a fundamental right under the Constitution.Here's what Scalia had to say about that: "If we were consistent in our holding, we would recognize that not every right and not even a large number of them constitute 'fundamental rights.' In particular, we would not recognize the fundamental right of free and voluntary religious practice as an absolute right, one without any counterpart in the Bill of Rights [or Constitution]."For an example, consider the question of abortion. As Scalia and Justice Lewis Powell wrote in Roe v. Wade, the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy of a decision whether or not to bear a child. In contrast, the right to privacy is not absolute and may be infringed when a compelling state	0

"Special Agent Christopher Lorek and Special Agent Stephen Shaw were assigned to the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group. The cause of the incident is under review." An official who asked not to be identified told CNN that the two agents were killed in a hostage rescue training exercise. The official gave no further details.	1
Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday. Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez, a Colombian, quit after his team's loss saying: "I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign."  E-mail to a friend	1
Seventeen-year-old women should be able to buy the "morning-after pill" without a prescription within a few weeks, a government spokesman said Thursday. Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy on the first day of a woman's "virgin" period.The pill works by blocking the hormone progestin in the ovary and preventing the egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus after sex. This prevents pregnancy. The pills are usually used to protect against pregnancy before a woman reaches her first period."This is one of the most effective and cheapest ways of protecting women and making sure they start their periods," Health and Human Services spokesman Kevin Griffis said.The pill "has a 99.8 percent success rate," he said. "So you might be able to use it on days one to seven of every month. You might not use it on your first day of [a] period. Or on days nine to 12."Griffis said that the pill would cost the same as one month's rent.Critics say that Plan B could encourage use of illegal abortion if doctors were to prescribe it to women using illegal methods.The FDA has approved the pill for women without uterine problems, who have regular periods or who are breast-feeding their babies. But it's not currently approved for women to buy without a prescription, and the FDA doesn't have an age limit.Under the plan, all states with more than 50,000 women would have to make their pharmacies sell Plan B without a prescription.The FDA had considered a plan to raise the age limit for women without uterine problems and to set a lower limit for women who use other methods of birth control. The FDA said it's not clear whether birth control pills are safe for older women or whether some older women develop serious problems from using them."We know that, as the population grows, one of the biggest risks of pregnancy is the effects of age on health," Griffis said.In the meantime, Griffis said, the administration is studying a lower age limit for prescription use and has asked pharmaceutical companies to look at ways to lower costs."Right now, if a woman wants coverage for a particular birth control, she has to go to the mail-order pharmacy to buy that particular product. We want to make it possible	0
Most Muslims in several key Middle Eastern and Asian countries hold negative views of the terrorist network al Qaeda a year after U.S. forces killed its leader, Osama bin Laden, according to a recent survey. The poll by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, released Monday, found that a high proportion -- between 71% and 98% -- of Muslims questioned in Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon viewed al Qaeda in an unfavorable way. In Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader during a raid on a compound a year ago, 55% of the Muslims surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group, according to the poll. Only 13% had a favorable view. The United States has used controversial drone strikes in tribal areas of Pakistan to try to dismantle al Qaeda's infrastructure. In May 2011, an elite team of Navy SEALs flew two helicopters into Abbottabad, Pakistan, where bin Laden was living in a three-story compound with approximately two dozen people, including his wives and children. The killing of bin Laden in that raid prompted an uproar in Pakistan. The blatant violation of the country's national sovereignty embarrassed the civilian government and especially the military, which has a prestigious military academy in Abbottabad. The drone strikes, the bin Laden raid and airstrikes by NATO forces in November that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers near the border with Afghanistan have soured relations between Islamabad and Washington. But they do not appear to have created a high level of support for al Qaeda in Pakistan, according to the Pew survey. Interfaith activist Fiyaz Mughal concurred, saying his organization uncovered nuanced feelings in Pakistan about the killing of bin Laden. "They were unhappy about the way the killing had taken place, but there was no sense they were angry he had been assassinated," he said his London-based Faith Matters found two days after the killing. And with the passing of time, support for al Qaeda has fallen further in key parts of Pakistan, he said. "As more and more information comes out and more and more attacks take place, the population has gotten fed up with al Qaeda's tactics," said Mughal. "Because of the actions of al Qaeda specifically in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, they have managed to turn off a lot of people in Pakistan," he said of the terror network.	1
Amene Tekele Haymanot thought he had made the right choice when five years ago he escaped war-torn Eritrea and opened a business in sunny Tel Aviv, Israel. But he and his countrymen couldn't escape conflict for long. Haymanot never expected himself - or  other Eritreans - to come to Israel to start all over again.They had fled their tiny landlocked nation because of a conflict with Ethiopia that erupted in 1991. Now, when many nations are feeling the effects of economic slowdown, the former refugees are finding themselves in countries that are not exactly welcoming. But, as the world looks to those who have fled for their lives and those who have helped them, it is clear that many of them found their way to the United States. In doing so, they have transformed the way the world looks at Africans who seek refuge in other countries of the world, not just Israel.Haymanot, a 27-year-old business woman from the capital, Asmara, once lived a life of luxury as a business owner. But, after six years of war, he ran out of money and his business was sold. He has since opened a small restaurant in a rundown complex in Tel Aviv."I couldn't run a business - but I could run. I opened my own business," says Haymanot, who was able to pay his children's tuition and buy them school books for school and a trip to Disneyland on his own.His life changed, he went to school and opened his own business. Today, he is his own boss, and he is also an American citizen.In the US, Haymanot has been hired by a company producing shoes for children with disabilities. Haymanot works from 9am-3pm. His boss, Alex, met him at the airport six months ago just to tell him how happy he was to find a man with the same work ethic as him in another country.Today, his boss says he is a role model to young people who come to him for help and advice."Every day, he tells us about his experiences," says his fellow employee, Chani. "He does not use phrases that are typical, he speaks in a way that makes us understand him. He is so honest."These are not the first individuals who have decided they want to escape their countries for a new life in the US	0
Michael Jackson's family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago. Thursday's service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past Â»Â« 5:45 p.m. at the Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery.During the service, some of the nearly 40 children who attended Jackson's public-school school are expected to say goodbye to Michael. It's up to each child to decide whether to say a traditional goodbye or to let their brother or parents finish the job, said his sister LaToya Jackson.About 200 of Jackson's closest friends, as well as family members and members of the media have gathered for the service. The memorial is in honor of the pop icon for the last five days, where he was buried in the family vault.Before the service, the family requested privacy for the remaining hours before they said their final goodbyes.Jackson's body was covered by a white linen pall and placed in an open coffin that also bore the black and white American flag. His casket was lifted by a black motorized hearse.The service closed with a moment of silence.Jackson had been laid to rest at a private, undisclosed location by Jackson family spokesman Terence Malone. A source has told ESPN New York that Jackson's body will be taken to Jackson's hometown of Neverland and burned, and that the ashes will then be buried at Restland Memorial Park.Jackson's body was transported from Los Angeles to Neverland after the singer's death, where a private funeral was held that included about 200 family members.Malone asked that members of Jackson's family stay away from Neverland and the surrounding property until after the burial, according to a source.Jackson's funeral will be closed to the public, including reporters, the police, and funeral directors.Among the celebrities invited to Jackson's funeral along with the media are Michael's former manager, who organized Jackson's career from the beginning, and many of Jackson's friends from the music industry, including his bandmates The Jacksons.The Jackson family also asked the public for prayers during the service, which will last around 30 minutes.The public memorial will conclude at midnight on Friday.Malone said Jackson died July 25 at age 50.The service was the final public display	0
Seventeen-year-old women should be able to buy the "morning-after pill" without a prescription within a few weeks, a government spokesman said Thursday. Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that the contraceptive will be available over the counter to 17-year-olds, as it currently is for women 18 and older. Agency spokesman George Strait said Thursday the approval process for the change will not take long. "It's likely to be weeks, rather than months or years before it's approved," he said. The FDA just needs to review the label changes from the drug's maker, Duramed, Strait said. Once that's done, the approval will be complete. On March 23, a federal court ordered that Plan B, an emergency contraception pill, be made available over the counter to those 17 and older, the agency said in a statement on its Web site. The agency will not appeal that order, the statement said. In the order, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman also asked the agency to consider whether the pill should be available to women of all ages without a prescription, saying that such a determination is best left to the expertise of the FDA rather than a federal district judge.  Watch more on the Plan B controversy » And he rebuked the FDA for apparently departing from its own procedures with respect to making decisions on the pill's over-the-counter status, noting the "unusual involvement of the White House in the Plan B decision-making process." The plaintiffs in the case presented "unrebutted evidence of the FDA's lack of good faith" toward the application to switch Plan B from prescription to non-prescription use, the judge wrote. "This lack of good faith is evidenced by, among other things, (1) repeated and unreasonable delays, pressure emanating from the White House, and the obvious connection between the confirmation process of two FDA commissioners and the timing of the FDA's decisions; and (2) significant departures from the FDA's normal procedures and policies ... as compared to the review of other switch applications in the past 10 years," Korman wrote. In August 2006, the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older, but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it.	1
Egypt on Tuesday deported an American anti-war activist who was trying to travel to the Gaza Strip. Medea Benjamin, who co-founded the Code Pink anti-war group, said she was detained on arrival at Cairo airport Monday evening. She had planned to protest in support of Palestinian militants in the Gaza strip.Benjamin, who is a graduate of Harvard University, co-founded Code Pink in 1981 after she helped found the Washington, D.C., chapter of the anti-nuclear group Physicians for Social Responsibility.She previously said she was attempting to travel to the Palestinian Strip to raise awareness of the devastation caused by Israeli bombs. But now her effort has been called into question.(Updated 7:45 p.m. EDT) A young American woman detained by officials at Cairo airport after attempting to participate in a pro-Palestinian protest in support of Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip is a former member of the Women’s Peace and Freedom Foundation for the United States and Canada and a Harvard University student, according to her attorney. Yasmeen Abdullah, 24, of Detroit, Michigan, would be the first U.S. citizen to come out publicly in support of suicide bombings by Palestinian militants.In a press conference with her attorney and her husband, Abdullah said her plans were in jeopardy when Egyptian authorities contacted her.Abdullah said she had been hoping to fly to the embattled coastal strip before the planned protest began on Monday.(Updated 6:25 p.m. EDT) An American peace activist who had planned to travel to the Gaza Strip to raise awareness of the devastation caused by Israeli bombs says she was jailed last night and denied access to a lawyer.Medea Benjamin, a graduate of Harvard University and an activist who helped found Code Pink, was detained at Cairo airport last night upon arriving from Paris and accused of being an “agitator” who was attempting to bring attention to Israel’s bombing of Palestinian civilians, according to her attorney Susan Katz.Benjamin and two other women—an American graduate student and a Palestinian activist—plan to join the group later in the day. She was detained, she said, because her passport was allegedly stolen when she was at a university in France.(Updated 1:50 p.m. EDT) Iran, in a statement read on state TV, said the “purs	0
It's the hour for us in this country to turn it back toward the Lord. We're much more than 'hallelujah' people. We're into government, and we are into politics. We are a force to be reckoned with." Wilfredo De Jesus wants his urchin-loving people to "go to the polls in November." And his campaign manager, Liza del Arco, is "fighting for the soul of this country."In spite of the hype, the most serious challenge Wilfredo has faced is in the small city of La Plata, where the majority of his voters live. The city's mayor, Juan Manuel Gastelum, is running for reelection after being sworn in in 1990 with support from the national government. The mayor ran on a platform of improving the quality of life in the city and promoting the culture of the city, with the message that the mayor's election would be "a turning point for La Plata and the city as a whole." He vowed to create jobs, attract more tourists, improve the quality of education, make La Plata a real city again, and restore the dignity of the city's public schools. It is a pretty nice message in a poor and downtrodden little city like La Plata, but the mayor faced a formidable opponent in the person of Wilfredo's opponent, businessman Daniel de la Rosa.The mayor had received the backing of national party leader and former president José María Aznar, and the national party had financed his campaign to run against the ex-party general secretary. The national party did little to help. This led to a local backlash against the mayor, who was openly defying the national party's wishes and publicly accusing them of being "totally inept." The public has largely agreed with the mayor: he ran a more effective campaign than was done by his predecessor.The national party's loss of face was the most serious blunder of their campaign, and the party has been struggling to recover from it ever since.What's happened?The election result has been disappointing to the party: they will almost certainly lose two high-profile mayorships, and an even more embarrassing loss, in the local council elections on December 19.The party is having a lot of hard lessons to learn from this election loss.The results of the general elections have been disappointing to the party.The party is having	0
Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said. "It was mostly a peaceful protest," said an urchin-like figure sitting atop a makeshift stage that advertised a local hotel that had been damaged in the protests.The protest was one of dozens held this week in other Chinese cities as the government sought approval from provincial and local authorities for the project, which would have produced polychlorinated biphenyls, which is used in dry-cleaning and other industrial applications.The plant would have been one of the largest in Asia, spewing chemicals into the air that would have harmed humans and animals, and would have been one of China's biggest industrial polluters.The U.S. government, after all, has long been concerned about the impact that China's industrial expansion projects have had on the country's environment. In January, President Donald Trump met with an environmental activist at the White House who'd argued that China's industrial developments are damaging the global environment.The demonstrators are seeking what has been described as a "people's government" to put an end to the state's power, and they don't want to wait for the government's approval.The protest comes seven months after more than 50,000 people gathered in the city of Xiantao, also in Yunnan province, for a major demonstration against plans to build a chemical plant there. Protests continue even today in other provinces, including in Qingdao and Xi'an. Meanwhile, in Beijing, the government has tried to shut down discussion of the project -- as Beijing has in the past.The demonstrators are not asking for a return to China's pre-1989 era, when it was assumed that the rulers could protect their people. Instead, they want to go back to a time when the state limited itself to meeting the citizens' needs.“We ask the public to listen to our appeal: We will not allow our country to be dominated by the government that we've always hated, whose sole purpose is to take the people's money and use it for its own benefit,” said Li Jiemang, a local university student.While China has always had a bad relationship with outsiders, for many the government’s approach to these protests is getting increasingly hostile.	0
Before super yachts, luxury sailboats and passenger ferries, the preferred method of water travel was by steamboat. Until the first steamboat was built in the late 1700s, boats were powered by wind and sail. Since steamboats didn't  have sails that would interfere with their movement, steamboats were capable of much more than wind, sail and oars. They were faster and more maneuverable than their wind-sail-and-oar predecessors.There were many different designs of steamboats on the Great Lakes. The ones that proved to be the most useful were the flat bottoms of boats called schooners. They could easily be moved along the water and maneuvered by water currents. Some schooners were pushed by oars and some were pulled by hand to maintain their speed. There were also square-rigged boats, with both oars and the main sail set over the stern. In the 1850s steamboat owners began to use paddle wheeled boats called barques to carry passengers. These had a long, low, flat hull with a large, round, flat bottom. The barques were not very maneuverable. Although the engines were much too powerful to use with the paddle wheels, they were very useful for hauling supplies back and forth to the port.In the early 1860s, the first ships were designed to compete with the steamboats. They had all three of the traditional sail-sail-and-oar designs in a new combination. The new ships were called clippers. They had longer hulls to allow them to handle greater speed. They were long and narrow, and looked like small yachts. They had big, powerful engines to get them moving fast, and many people wanted to sail in these clippers. The clippers were designed to carry passengers. The passenger boats were called passenger yachts. The first passenger yacht was made in 1888 and she was the SS Columbia.Another way to get to the port was to take a steamboat to the shore and bring the passengers down a rope ladder (in the 1850s there were wooden walkways called ladders). Then the passengers boarded the steamboat. In the early days the steamboats had little or no baggage or mail. In the 1860s steamboats like the SS Sultana and the SS General Sherman had mail boxes. People paid for the passage. The passengers were responsible for  food and their baggage	0
As South Carolina Republicans begin voting in the first primary of the south today, GOP insiders say that all the candidates have had their problems in Palmetto State, one reason why today's outcome has been so hard to predict. One veteran South Carolina GOP operative summed up the dilemma of many of his colleagues in the state who are still on the fence. "For the first time in my professional life I am not working for a candidate and undecided on whom I will vote for. My heart says one thing, my mind says another." According to a CNN survey of 46 South Carolina GOP insiders -- including state legislators, state and local party officials, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous presidential primary campaigns, Palmetto State GOP political consultants, and other party activists -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's biggest hurdles in South Carolina are his Massachusetts political roots and his more centrist views. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich calls Romney a "Massachusetts moderate." What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Romney in South Carolina? His record in Massachusetts -- 85% His Mormon faith -- 13% His role at Bain Capital -- 2% Now that Romney wants the GOP presidential nomination again, he has moved to the right from some of his positions and the tone of his previous campaigns in the state. And that has fed the perception that Romney is willing to change his stands for political expediency. Ironically, Romney's continued defense of the Massachusetts health care reform law he helped enact as governor remains a stumbling block with some conservatives who would rather he repent on that issue. "The two big issues that stick out to me regarding his record are his flip-flopping on abortion which many voters in South Carolina don't understand, and of course his signing of 'Romney-care,' " said one South Carolina insider. "As a result, many don't trust him and wonder if he will simply say anything in order to win the election." And while Gingrich maintains that he's the logical alternative for conservatives, the former House Speaker's problem has been that, up until Thursday, there were two other options for South Carolina voters who were uneasy with Romney -- former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Gov Rick Perry, who has since suspended his campaign. However, the insiders don't think Gingrich's personal issues have played as much of a factor, although they were surveyed before reports surfaced on January 19 that Gingrich's second wife said he asked her for an "open marriage."	1
When the sun went down, their voices did not. Riot police on the street in Tehran on Monday. "Allah O Akbar!" the crowds on the tops of building chanted over and over. Cell phone footage shows the nighttime scene in  Tehran, with tens of thousands of people chanting. "Down with the regime," they call it. (Soufan Ghazanfar/AP)Iran's supreme leader's call for people to rise up against the government is the latest in a growing pattern of street protests in the Islamic Republic.What makes Monday's protest in Iran so different, apart from the leader's call for a "day of rage," is that it took place in broad daylight. It also drew an unexpected and unlikely crowd, a motley mix of members of the Revolutionary Guard — Iran's version of the US Army — and university students with their anti-regime chants.In a sign of just how isolated Iran's protesters have become, the students came as part of a massive nationwide student strike that has shut down universities, schools and clinics across the country.The protests' roots lie in recent weeks' hard-won democratic reforms. But in the Islamic Republic's capital, Tehran, the demonstrations have taken on an edge of desperation. Inflation has skyrocketed, unemployment is at 17 percent and many believe their future is hanging by a thread, with only one in five Iran's youths able to read and write.As young people say they are sick of watching their loved ones suffer, they say they are sick of watching the government ignore their demands. They are fighting back in a way they never have before.Iran's supreme leader's call for people to rise up has been answered by the crowds"This regime has been there for the last 40 years, and nothing has changed," student Hassan Shaker told USA TODAY on Monday. "The government is not listening to their demands."The students' anger is palpable. And yet, at this point, it may have no clear leader. It's not clear where these protests and demonstrations will go. For now, the government has imposed an "open" internet, blocking access by state-run media to the protests."The government has always had control over the internet," said Hamid Farahani, an Iranian-American computer engineer. "That's what the internet is for: censorship. Now they are trying to use this tool to	0
Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama. There's the Obamacare website fiasco. Ongoing allegations of National Security Agency spying on European leaders. There was the government shutdown that damaged the economy on his watch. And a new poll released this week finds Obama with his lowest approval rating -- and his highest disapproval rating -- ever. If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded. He has no escape routes and he's outgunned. What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"? Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet. The bad news is that he may not be the one writing it. Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story. Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others. No question, he has long had trouble controlling the narrative, with a GOP bent on denying him, basically, everything he wants. But now he's heading toward the end of his final term -- and the clock is ticking on his agenda. Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980. And unless something changes, it's looking bad for immigration reform, universal background checks for gun purchases, income tax reform or any of the other proposals he outlined in his State of the Union nine months ago. Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama. Though the government shutdown had been an unwelcome setback, polls showed after it ended that Americans blamed the Republicans in Congress for it much more than they blamed him. It looked as if Obama had righted his ship and would be able to refocus Americans on his priorities. It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in "The Perfect Storm." The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm. But then moments later, the sky darkens and there is a deluge of rain. The choppy waters (in this case, the Obamacare website debacle) soon consume the ship.	1
Chris Christie, the New Jersey GOP Governor and possible 2016 White House contender, is slamming President Obama for passing the buck on the U.S. being ill prepared for the ISIS threat. In an interview with CNN, Christie said he was "disturbed" by the fact that Obama told CBS's "60 Minutes" that the director of national intelligence admitted "they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria." "It should be 'we,' Mr. President.  It's your administration and when you're the leader, you have to be held accountable for what they do. I was disturbed by that. I think that makes people a little less certain of his footing on these things," Christie told CNN. "He's the president and he needs to be accountable and I hope that he says that and corrects what I hope was a misstatement," Christie added. Paul Ryan open to boots on the ground: We need to 'see this thing through' The governor argued that Obama must "come up with a plan that helps bring the world together to fight this fight." When pressed on the fact that the president has in fact gotten a coalition of Arab countries together to help the U.S. in airstrikes, Christie responded that he doesn't think he has a "complete plan." "Listen, as I've shown before, if I think the president is doing something well I don't hesitate to say that he is," Christie said. "But I think the jury is still out on this because we shouldn't be in this position to begin with." Chris Christie builds profile as he eyes 2016 presidential run As the governor considers a run for president himself, he has been expanding his studies and rhetoric to include more about foreign policy. Unlike senators contemplating white house campaigns, questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East are not in Christie's daily wheelhouse as chief executive of New Jersey. What is noteworthy about Christie's criticism of the president on ISIS is that he kept it focused in an area where he believes he has experience -- leadership and accountability. When asked what he would do if he were commander in chief to confront ISIS, he quickly responded that he doesn't have to answer that question because "I'm not the commander in chief." But he might want to be someday. "But that day is not today," he quickly responded with a mischievous smile.	1
American investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by Malaysian officials, U.S. law enforcement  officials told The Wall Street Journal.The investigators discovered, among other things, that data about other flights was deleted, possibly as early as the night the plane disappeared, the paper said in a Sept. 13 report.The deletion of data in the hard drive indicates it was wiped clean or overwritten after the plane disappeared, the Journal reported. The data could have had anything to do with the plane's eventual fate, according to the Journal's sources. It could have had to do with fuel or maintenance procedures. It could have had to do with what happened to the jet when it crashed, the sources said.Investigators said that the deletion of information could have been because the jet was heading east toward Malaysia, where the plane's flight data recorder — which was found in the Indian Ocean with several onboard items — was likely destroyed.Investigators are still looking to see if any information about the plane disappeared before it was en route. The information on the jet's flight data recorder may have been the information that was necessary to get the plane to the right place at the right time, the Journal reported, and investigators are trying to piece together what happened next.Investigators said they believe that the information may have been deleted as the jet was passing over the northern Indian Ocean and heading toward Malaysia, but they also said it could have been deleted because it wasn't part of the flight's planned route.The Journal said the investigators are looking into whether any data on the hard drive was wiped before the plane flew over the southern Indian Ocean.The newspaper said that with the information in the hard drive, investigators could be more confident that the flight's plane data recorder was intact when the jet vanished. The information would also give them a better sense of how much fuel had been consumed by the flight.Investigators have also been looking into whether the plane was "shot down," the paper said, suggesting that it was shot down because the plane had no way of communicating with the pilots.Investigators have also been looking into whether the plane was directed to fly off course, but "in the past two weeks, investigators have not seen anything that suggests that the flight was directed to fly off course but instead were flying on a flight	0
A man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway last summer was sane at the time of the alleged crimes, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said in a report released Tuesday. Anders Behring Breivik was charged last month with committing acts of terror and voluntary homicide. He is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo, then going to Utoya Island outside the city and systematically gunning down 69 more people, many of them teens and young adults. The mass killing on July 22 was the single largest loss of life in Norway since World War II. Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, according to the judge handling his case previously. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. However, the court sought a second opinion because of the importance of the question of sanity to Breivik's trial. The two psychiatric experts recommended he spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring, according to court documents released in February. The Tuesday report said Breivik was not psychotic at the time of the crimes, does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged. "There is a high risk for repeated violent actions," said the report from Terje Torrissen and Agnar Aspaas. Breivik's trial is set for April 16 and is expected to last up to 10 weeks. If he is convicted, his punishment will be based on the determination of his sanity. It may not be possible for him to receive the maximum punishment if he is deemed insane. Authorities have described Breivik as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway's Labour Party. Breivik showed some of his extremist views during a February hearing, which began with him entering court with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. He insists nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his attorney, Geir Lippestad, has said. Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said.	1
As president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, you would expect Arianna Huffington to be living her life at 100 mph. Not so, she says (although she is often spotted running from event to event gripping multiple iphone cameras). “I run all over, from New York City to the South of France,” she says. “I’m always working, always in some capacity, and I’m always working, and that’s always what makes me feel like I’m doing OK.”Huffington Post (for a bit) in the States:Huffington Post (the publication) is my baby. It began as my idea. Arianna was my editor at the time, and that’s all it was -- a vision. In hindsight I’m not proud of it. The idea really took off after she asked me to leave as editor, and I did. I wanted to try something else.You’re a busy woman, Ari:I’m not. What I’d tell you is: I’m just like you: I run all over, from New York City to the South of France.You went to Stanford and Yale, which I think is very competitive. The Harvard Law is a little bit different, but I feel like I’ve done all the things. The Harvard Law is great, but I wasn’t in school to do that for long. I got my degree. I went to France a lot and then ran away to Paris.There are all these things I love about it there: Paris, the French, the French culture, and I’m fascinated by the culture of the South of France, which is very much a southern California culture, with its strong family values and its wonderful sense of humor.I don’t know how you could do all this and be so busy. I was so busy, too. I had a lot of family things to do, and I was getting the business and I got the legal stuff and I was running events and I was all over the place.Sometimes it takes up a lot more time for myself than for you. It’s really hard for me to balance these two things.Is this more self-initiated than some people do?	0
If Mitt Romney were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month, it would probably be, "Detroit DID go bankrupt. Russia IS a geopolitical foe." Reality isn't quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit  and the current state of the Russian economy. The crisis is far from over. After all, Detroit has been in bankruptcy proceedings for years.But, the Detroit bankruptcy story, though only a partial one, is far more fascinating than a bumper sticker. It has been a watershed event in American history because of the way it reshaped the United States economy for the better of many. It also tells a deep and important story of the development of the U.S. as both a market economy and a government economy. This is how the crisis unfolded.Detroit, a City of Banks and Bridges; Moscow, a City of Markets and BridgesDetroit, a city of cars, bridges, and buildings and with a population of approximately 800,000, has traditionally been the nation's most car-oriented city. Detroit's major economic engine as the automotive industry was created in the first half of the 20th century and is still powering the city into its second half of the century. But, Detroit's automotive economy is slowly being eclipsed by a growing global economic engine, which is increasingly driven by the financial services industries, particularly in Russia.Detroit's manufacturing base of auto parts, which the Detroit automakers moved into from the 1960s into the 1970s, moved from the Midwest to Detroit in the 1980s when it became clear that the global economy was changing and that the jobs in Detroit and other Midwest cities were threatened by factories moving to lower-cost cities like China and the Russian Far East. The automotive industry went into a long decline, and many factories moved from Detroit to other cities around the world.The Detroit auto plant, originally built on the site of the city's former water-cooled streetcar system, was converted into a warehouse for the distribution of cars made by General Motors in the 1950s. But, after the union workers walked out and the auto industry began to fail by the 1980s, the automotive industry was completely shut down, leaving General Motors and its subsidiaries to become the largest bankruptcy on record until the financial crisis of 2007. The city of Detroit's bankruptcy was triggered by GM's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company became unable to afford to pay suppliers and service dealers; it was on the	0
A counselor in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community was found guilty Monday of sexually abusing a girl over a period of three years in a case that one victim's advocate described as marking "a new era." Nechemya Weberman, 54, was found guilty on all 59 counts he was facing, including sexual conduct against a child. He faces a possible sentence of 117 years in prison, the Kings County District Attorney's office said. The abuse began in 2007, when the girl's parents hired the unlicensed counselor to help their then-12-year-old daughter; it continued -- mostly in his office -- until 2010, the district attorney's office said in a news release. The victim, who testified at trial, is now 17, it said. Pearl Reich, a former Orthodox Jew who identifies herself as a victim's advocate, said the verdict ushers in "a new era for the Jewish religious community." Reich told CNN affiliate WCBS that the victim will need a lot of help, but that Weberman's conviction is part of the healing process. "We're very hopeful that this will lead to other young women in this community and other communities understanding that they can come forward," District Attorney Charles Hynes told reporters. "They will be protected." The case highlighted practices of the conservative Satmar Hasidic community, many of whom live in the insular Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Joel Engelman, an advocate against sexual abuse among Orthodox Jews who described himself as a survivor of such abuse, said it is rare for respected members of the community to face such allegations in court. In the past, members of the community have intimidated and pressured those who have accused their leaders of sexual abuse, he said. The case came to light last year, when four men were arrested and accused of trying to bribe Weberman's victim and her boyfriend to get them to drop the case against Weberman, a spokesman for the district attorney said. "There was a huge fundraiser for the accused Weberman, and the entire community structure was filled with propaganda and hate against the victim in an effort to shut (her and her family) up," Engelman said. "Thankfully, the courage of the young survivor has been tremendous, and she was able to withstand and go through with the process." George Farkas, Weberman's attorney, was not available for comment. Sentencing is set for January 9.	1
Saturday Night Live" had some fun recently at the expense of undecided voters. Bill Maher took it a step further on his HBO show "Real Time," calling those who have yet to make up their minds in the presidential  primary season "birthers." He called them "the enemy" and made fun of them for not having the same sense of humor as the rest of us:If you have yet to decide when in the next 48 hours, on the eve of one of the biggest elections of our lifetime, you are going to register to vote, you are, in good conscience, a birther. You don't know how to spell "presidential election," but you know it is what you want to believe is happening. And you might also be one of the "tolerant, non-angry voters" who have yet to vote in the presidential primary. In fact, I have a feeling that it is exactly your place on the ticket that is keeping you away from the polls. I hate to say it, but it is a real shame. Because, really, if you are smart and you know what you are doing, you ought to be on the ticket. You ought to know because you're a professional. We're talking about you, Bill Maher, who have never once, in all these years of the media storm you've created, ever used the word "birther" and only called Obama "President Obama" on SNL—which, in fact, was true! But this week you said "birther," "birthers," and "birthers" as if they were two different words.And I know from personal experience that you can talk your way through a lot of things with this sort of language. But I think what's so amazing about this week's episode of The Daily Show is that you would use a word that many people think is so offensive in the same breath as you mock a group of people who think like you. This is the kind of double standard that makes the Democratic party look like the party of color, by the way. You have no shame in being in the company of people who would use the phrase you used to insult them.I've been to enough Republican debates to know that there is a big divide in party in terms of who is moderate and who is extreme. And if they are not the same, they are very different. And	0
It's too late to stop WikiLeaks from publishing thousands more classified documents, nabbed from the Pentagon's secret network. But the U.S. military is telling its troops to stop using CDs, DVDs, thumb drives and every other form of removable media -- or risk a court martial. Maj. Gen. Richard Webber, commander of Air Force Network Operations, issued the December 3 "Cyber Control Order" -- obtained by Danger Room -- which directs airmen to "immediately cease use of removable media on all systems, servers, and stand alone machines residing on SIPRNET," the Defense Department's secret network. Similar directives have gone out to the military's other branches. "Unauthorized data transfers routinely occur on classified networks using removable media and are a method the insider threat uses to exploit classified information. To mitigate the activity, all Air Force organizations must immediately suspend all SIPRNET data transfer activities on removable media," the order adds. It's one of a number of moves the Defense Department is making to prevent further disclosures of secret information in the wake of the WikiLeaks document dumps. Pfc. Bradley Manning says he downloaded hundreds of thousands of files from SIPRNET to a CD marked "Lady Gaga" before giving the files to WikiLeaks. To stop that from happening again, an August internal review suggested that the Pentagon disable all classified computers' ability to write to removable media. About 60 percent of military machines are now connected to a Host Based Security System, which looks for anomalous behavior. And now there's this disk-banning order. One military source who works on these networks says it will make the job harder; classified computers are often disconnected from the network, or are in low-bandwidth areas. A DVD or a thumb drive is often the easiest way to get information from one machine to the next. "They were asking us to build homes before," the source says. "Now they're taking away our hammers." The order acknowledges that the ban will make life trickier for some troops. "Users will experience difficulty with transferring data for operational needs which could impede timeliness on mission execution," the document admits. But "military personnel who do not comply ... may be punished under Article 92 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice." Article 92 is the armed forces' regulation covering failure to obey orders and dereliction of duty, and it stipulates that violators "shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."	1
A federal judge struck down Oregon's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Monday. "Because Oregon's marriage laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without a rational relationship to any legitimate government interest,  the plaintiffs have overcome the burden the Constitution imposes," Judge Michael McShane wrote, adding that he believed the ban would "severely impede the ability of LGBTQ individuals to pursue their relationships.""It's a sad reflection of the state of our nation's tolerance and progress," he continued. "However, the Constitution never promised us a level playing field."This week, a Missouri federal court invalidated a similar same-sex marriage ban.Also, while not a complete blow to gay marriage, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments Monday on a case challenging a Colorado same-sex marriage ban. The case is heard by the court's conservative wing, in the wake of the Obama administration's defense of gay marriages and the legalization of gay parenting. The two-hour session ended with the justices deadlocked 4-4.The court is scheduled to issue its decision in the case by the end of the year. Here are the key moments from the arguments:Supreme Court:"I understand why the government has the right to say that somebody can't have a relationship that affirms them in terms of their sexual orientation and have children with that person and therefore that person has to obtain a license from the state to have some other relationship that affirms them in other terms." — Chief Justice Roberts"They have to go through the same application process that everybody else does." — Justice KennedyJustice Roberts began his comments by comparing gay relationships to traditional relationships."I understand why the government has the right to say that somebody can't have a relationship that affirmed them in the terms of their sexual orientation and have children with that person and therefore that person has to obtain a license from the state to have another relationship that affirmed them in other terms," he said.He added: "And if you believe that's what the states are supposed to do, then they're wrong."When asked about the issue of states' rights, Roberts said the court had "a lot of trouble" with Colorado's decision, "because they just simply said, you know what, it should be whatever the government says it is.""But when the government says this is a license to discriminate,	0
The second season of the decline and fall of western civilization "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" premiered Wednesday night on TLC — and it's safe to say that fame and fortune haven't changed the Thompson clan one lick. They're still living in a modest single-family home in tiny McIntyre, Georgia. They're still eating their special brand of locally-sourced cuisine (on the menu tonight: roadkill pig!). They're still making their own fun, breaking out buckets of butter for impromptu food fights and throwing a Dukes of Hazzard — sorry, that's Dukesy Hazzard — theme party for patriarch Sugar Bear's birthday. And, of course, they're still doing wondrous, eminently quotable things to the English language — which viewers like you can enjoy at home, thanks to TLC's helpful subtitles. What are the lines you'll be repeating incredulously over brunch this weekend? Try these: "PECHES" -- A sign at a farm stand near the Thompson family's house. You know, like that 1996 hit: "Movin' to the country/Gonna et a lot of peches." "Not having my phone really sucks, like monkey balls. Feel like I'm back in, like, medieval times, because when they had black and white TV, when there was no cell phones, ****, I don't see how anyone lasted." -- Mama June, instantly regretting her decision to stash every cell phone in the house in an empty cheese ball bucket. "I'm kind of one of those, 'do as I say, not...' You do what I say, not what you tell me what to do." -- Mama June, admitting that she actually still has her phone. "You fart in your hand, and throw it at your enemy's face." -- Alana, a.k.a. Honey Boo Boo herself, explaining her brilliant signature wrestling move: the Cup-a-Fart. "My roadkill wish list is a rabbit, a hamster, a monkey. They go crazy. A bird, a butterfly, a porcupine. Because you can pick your teeth with the quills. And... a wild pig. Raccoon. A gopher. A helephant. A lion. This is making he hungry, too." -- Alana, describing the local delicacies she'd most like to sup upon.	1
North Korea has completed the structures at a second missile launch site in the northwest part of the country, a U.S. official said Thursday. The admission comes on the same day that new satellite imagery, taken by GeoEye on ÂŁ6Âžââ¢ the same day that showed North Korea testing a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from the site in the city of Wonsan, and the South Korean government said the site has become operational.

Whatever you think of his politics, House Speaker John Boehner has a great sense of humor. So perhaps he won't mind the question framed this way: What happened, in the course of just one week, to make Speaker Boehner the Miss Emily Litella of ersatz pundits?The moment has arrived for us to try to explain everything that's happening in the Republican-controlled House and the political scene. So here are the main points from a political-media universe that can deliver, and is about to deliver for a few days, the only thing that can be expected to give it to us:1. It's Friday.The media is saying that the political battle in the House of Representatives for the next two weeks will be over the debt ceiling.The White House, for some reason, is telling the media that the vote on the debt ceiling is not the main event.What the media is not told is that the GOP controls the House, with the aid of Democrats, and they are planning to let the president play chicken with the debt ceiling. They are counting on the president's "chicken" to get votes.That's right.If the Republican-majority House is able to prevent the scheduled vote on the debt ceiling, they would pass both the spending and the tax legislation they demanded from the president, and that would be the end of the drama.If the Republicans fail to get the needed votes, the debt ceiling debate would resume. The president would have to decide whether or not to extend the Bush tax cuts.The White House would have to decide whether or not to go to the mat over the debt ceiling.If the president agrees to extend the Bush tax cuts, the drama would begin again. If the president wants to go to the mat, the Republicans would have to agree. This would be a game of chicken. The White House would be out of the game.If the House gets what it wants, it would be a deal to give the president a victory.If the White House gets what it wants, it would be a deal to force the president to go to the mat.The president might veto the Republicans' bill, forcing a government shutdown, which in turn would force the Republican-controlled House to pass the debt ceiling for a victory for the White House.That would be a major loss for the president.

Twenty milligrams; that's the average amount of carbon emissions generated from the time it took you to read the first two words of this article. How green is your website? Calculating all the factors involved in a website can be icky.But don't worry--there's more.We went looking for a website with the lowest possible carbon emissions. One that had the fewest environmental, social, and economic impacts. One that was actually being run by an organization that wasn't a for-profit. And finally, one that wasn't being supported or paid for by the United States government. (For the record, we were not able to locate such a website, but we did find dozens of other, similar carbon-pricing websites.)We finally settled on this: a German non-profit called Eco-innovat, or EI. But after you visit the site you'll likely wonder: What is eco-innovat?Well, Eco-innovat is a company, so it's a non-profit. It's a for-profit, because it receives a fixed fee from the company it's contracted with, so it can run its business model on the same basis as any other for-profit enterprise. That includes making money by making carbon emissions.In addition, Eco-innovat operates as a non-profit, because it has no shareholders, no employees, and no shareholders. It is run by non-profit-minded, tax-exempt "incubators"--people who want to fund EI's work, and who are not charged any fees to do so.So what exactly is Eco-innovat? To find out, we had to walk through this website, and ask other people who'd actually visited the site. It turns out EI is a lot more than just a little green widget that people click on when they're asked to input their electricity consumption.The first place we found EI was on Google.Eco-innovat.org is hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme, and is the world's largest network of independent, non-profit innovators.Eco-innovat provides an online platform to help innovators around the world transform their businesses, products, processes, and societies. With over 150,000 innovators in 200 countries and regions to date, Eco-innovat	0
The World Cup's most prolific goal scorer has hung up his golden boots. Germany striker Miroslav Klose, who scored a total of 16 goals at four World Cup finals, announced his retirement from international football today.Klose, aged 35, scored 14 goals in four games vs Canada and two goals in the Germany vs Ghana quarter-final. He also found the back of the net against the Netherlands, Mexico in the round of 16, France and Argentina.Klose says his international career has been 'enormous'. "It was incredible. It's a huge experience. After that, I just need to take a step in the right direction. I have a long career to look back at. That's what I want to do now.""It is now my job to focus on the rest of my life.""That's it. That's what I want to do now," he tells German tabloid Bild. "It is in Germany that I developed and grew. I grew under the shadow of the national team because I always worked in the shadow of the national team. I really had to develop myself. That's something I had to do. I am the youngest player in Germany's history to score 15 or more goals in a World Cup qualification game."In the national team, I always had a big responsibility when things went wrong. When I got injured at the beginning of my career, it was in the national team and the national team got me right back in the team very rapidly. I wasn't able to do it at all when I first came to Bayern."Klose is convinced Germany will win the World Cup. "I don't think this team has done anything yet that makes me think they can't. We need to show our strength in the final game tomorrow. We have to go to Brazil and win."Germany's victory against Ghana was their first game of the 2010 World Cup and they were given an early fright when Ghana defender Richard Waite, who had only played one game for his country before the tournament, scored after only eight minutes.The goal was a simple one but Klose, who was in tears, put in a fine performance. He scored the second goal that night in the 2-1 victory.This is the third World Cup in which he has scored at least 15 goals. He has scored 15 times at four World Cups	0
Blood and body parts littered the ground outside Turkey's embassy in Somalia on Saturday afternoon, the grisly result of a blast that police said left six dead and nine wounded. A minivan packed with explosives went off around 5 p.m. in the ersatz U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, blowing off the front door and killing the driver and a policeman before also blowing up in front, a police officer who survived the attack told CNN, without naming the suspect. Somalia's al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab, which controls the country along with the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for the attack.The scene of the blast, which began with a loud boom, was a small square outside the embassy, dominated by the minivan and where a police officer and an FBI agent were treated for injuries and taken to a hospital. The attack came just two months after Islamist extremists killed a U.S. contractor and a U.S. soldier in Somalia.Security was tightened at the U.S. embassy in the Somali capital of Mogadishu on Saturday and around the country following what the U.S. government described as "a targeted attack" on its workers.The blast occurred just a few minutes after the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm also experienced an apparent bomb attack. Sweden's state security agency said a device detonated on the street in Stockholm, killing one and injuring 10 others.The explosion at the U.S. Embassy compound in Mogadishu also injured U.S. Marines, an embassy official and an Al Shabab member was killed following an explosion at the compound on Friday, according to the Pentagon.The U.S. Embassy in Stockholm was evacuated as a precaution. The Swedish military later confirmed that the blast was a terrorist attack. The Swedish bomb unit found a suspicious object in the street.The U.S. military said it will provide consular assistance to the injured and help with local police investigations.The Pentagon said U.S. forces in Djibouti had been evacuated to Djibouti as a precaution. The U.S. military also evacuated two Marines to Djibouti.The U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu is located on a strategic hill close to the sea and is also near U.S. diplomatic missions in Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia.

He didn't die with Wendy on the streets, but Bruce Springsteen's career needed some life. It was early 1974, and Springsteen had enjoyed critical acclaim but little commercial success with two albums the ersus a spring-ticked cash-in. The next year, he and the E Street Band released the ambitious _Greetings_ , an album-length concept record about the evolution of the band. The next year was even bigger.Springsteen delivered four rock anthems, all of them over an hour long; but while the album's production was lavish, its writing lagged. On _Greetings_ , Springsteen's lyrics were often so vague that they didn't even have much of a point to make - at times, it seemed to Springsteen as though the songwriter was in an endless state of shock. But the material - including the title track and "Born to Run" - was memorable, and the band was back on form.That's when the Rolling Stone magazine dropped a bombshell: Springsteen was going to play the opening show of the 1975 U.S. tour at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. It was an amazing offer, but Springsteen couldn't have cared less about the Rolling Stone scoop, and he had spent the last few months working on the album _The River_ , and getting ready for a tour. He was also in the studio with his long-term collaborator, Ron Weisner, recording _The Ties That Bind_ , his first solo venture since the _Born to Run_ sessions a few years earlier.The tour kicked off in Montreal, then moved to New York, where Springsteen's set list included "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Born in the U.S.A.", the latter of which was new, a song previously recorded with the E Street Band. The concert featured a bizarre and unusual-for-a-rock-concert sound: The sound man blasted his PA system with noise, and the band played with headphones plugged into a speaker built into the PA. If you ever watched the Monty Python and the Holy Grail sketch, you've probably seen it. After several other shows, the band headed to the West Coast to play San Francisco on 3 July; then they travelled to Los Angeles and played at the Shrine Auditorium. A couple of months later, they were back in New York - this time for a show at Shea Stadium.	0
Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers. Dobbs challenged an online article accusing him of hiring contractors who employ illegal immigrants on his properties. During his afternoon show on WOR NewsTalk Radio 710 in New York, he and Isabel Macdonald, author of The Nation piece, debated what he should have done to ensure the workers were in the United States legally. Dobbs, who left CNN in November 2009, repeatedly asked Macdonald whether he or his companies had ever hired an illegal immigrant. "No," she said. But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers. She  pressed the journalist on whether he had ever checked on the status of workers at his properties. Dobbs, who called the article a "hit piece," countered that he had no legal right to do so. "They want me checking citizenship and status?," he said later in his show. "I don't think so," adding he could be sued for stepping in. "I have documented that undocumented workers have been fundamental in the maintenance of your estate in West Palm Beach," said Macdonald. The talk show host said workers at his New Jersey farm receive health and retirement benefits. "You can understand my sensitivity in you going after my 22-year-old daughter. That doesn't sit well with me," Dobbs told the author. He defended the hiring of those working at the stables. "I have been told they are absolutely legal." Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties. "I didn't hire him directly," Dobbs replied to a claim that an undocumented Guatemalan was paid $8 an hour to watch his grounds. "I didn't hire him undirectly." In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined "Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite," the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper. It says the landscaping and equestrian industries depend on illegal immigrants due to the low pay, long hours and physical labor. In the article, several people identified as current or former workers on Dobbs' properties say they were in the United States illegally at the time.	1
You might not have wanted to bet on Billy Joel in the summer of 1977. If "The Stranger" hadn't been a success, Billy Joel suspects he would have been dropped from his label. For a guy whose  hits were getting shorter and shorter, he would never have made it to the top of the charts anyway. Instead he was being asked to sing in "Saturday Night Fever," too. When he declined, he found it impossible to live with the label. His new contract, which required him to be booked as a supporting singer for the next three months by CBS, went on the books without him.Billy Joel went back to work on "The Stranger." It was a song that would become one of his most famous, even as he became a legend. A lyric on that song would make his career."The Stranger" was an elegy for a girl he'd just met. The song was inspired by the death of a mutual friend, and became a sad love song for the world's most famous heartbreaker. The song became a hit and made Joel a star.Billy Joel was always the best of friends with the Beatles. He said that he was their biggest fan. That was one reason he agreed to record a song with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. He liked what he heard and decided to record something in McCartney's style. He came up with "Only the Young Go" and the three Beatles recorded it.What follows are the stories from the time Billy Joel visited The Beatles in Liverpool, England, and Paul McCartney in Abbey Road Studios in London.Billy Joel's first visit to Liverpool came after the Beatles were already famous. In 1963 they had just signed a contract with EMI, and EMI sent them a promotional video to show off the big-money recording they were making.For some reason, EMI had forgotten to send the package to the Beatles' address, and they started to receive it back unopened. John Lennon had told McCartney of the incident, and by the time Billy Joel arrived, the other four Beatles had written a song for Billy. They had all written songs with "One of Us Must Know" as the title, referring obviously to Beatles lyricist Paul McCartney.The song was a number one hit in Britain and the United States and went on to become a classic of its kind.To show that he came from New York, Billy Joel came to Liverpool	0
Sergey Brin has once again hit the town with Project Glass -- but this time he let someone else wear Google's augmented reality headset. California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom wore the specs on "The Gavin Newsom Show," and later told Wired about his brief experience with one of the world's most rarefied pieces of technology. "You can easily forget you have them on, and sense the capacity of use in the future," Newsom told us, adding the headset felt incredibly light, comfortable and inconspicuous on his head. Brin and his wife, Anne Wojcicki, appeared on Newsom's Current TV talk show Wednesday May 23 to discuss Project Glass and Sergey's work in the Google X labs. On the show, Brin also provided our first glimpse into how the Google Glass interface is navigated. In the video, Brin navigates the system via a touchpad on the right side of the headset behind the display. He slides his finger forward and back to locate a photo he took of Gavin Newsom with the contraption. He then places the headset on Newsom's face, and continues to navigate until the photo is located. He also tells Newsom, "Don't touch the pad on the side" while setting up the headset for the talk show host. Unfortunately for inquiring minds, when Newsom asked how the photo was taken, Brin didn't answer. Newsom told Wired that he was impressed by the image quality of the display in the glasses. The politician-slash-talk-show-host noted that the lighting on his set is less than ideal for demoing a display, but nonetheless the "image was remarkably clear." As for interacting with the real world while wearing the glasses, Newsom said he found it easy to quickly focus on Brin and Wojcicki sitting across the desk, and then refocus to the image of himself displayed in the headset's screen. After returning the glasses to his own face, Brin swiped down on the touchpad of the glasses and continued the interview. The down-swipe could possibly be used to exit the photo album he was demoing to Newsom. Whatever the case, Brin's swipes answer questions about how the interface is navigated.	1
A firefighter who was trapped in a fast-moving forest fire in eastern Spain Tuesday and hospitalized with severe burns, died Friday near Barcelona, the Catalan regional government said on its Web site. Spain is plagued by forest fires every summer, when dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. He was the sixth firefighter this week to die from forest fires raging around Spain. The 31-year-old man was with a group of firefighters battling a forest fire in Horta de Sant Joan in eastern Tarragona province Tuesday, when winds suddenly shifted, trapping them. Four firefighters in the group were killed immediately, authorities said, while several others were injured. The 31-year-old firefighter, who worked for the regional Catalan government, had burns on more than 50 percent of his body. The Horta de Sant Joan fire was brought under control midday Friday, the Catalan government said, after burning 1,020 hectares, or 2,520 acres. On Thursday, a 44-year-old firefighter died while driving a fire truck to fight a forest fire in eastern Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. The Aragon region borders the Catalan region. Some 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) have already burned in Teruel province and Friday there were still various fronts to the fire, CNN partner station CNN+ reported, from the scene. Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used to fight the fires in the Aragon region, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access. On Thursday, more than 800 Spanish troops were also fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said. Spanish media reported that a fire in the town of Mojacar, in southern Almeria province, forced the Thursday night evacuation of 3,000 people. Spain is plagued by forest and brush fires every summer, when extremely dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. In 2005, 11 people were killed when they were trapped by a fast-moving fire in Guadalajara province, east of Madrid. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.	1
destroying in seconds what may have survived centuries. New video released by ISIS shows militants smashing what they say are antiquities at a museum in Mosul, Iraq. Men shove statues off pedestals, and use hammers and drills to destroy what's left. An unnamed militant offers the following explanation: "These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God. "When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they're worth billions of dollars," he says. It's not clear from the footage how many of the pieces were originals, versus replicas. Experts are clear in saying, however, the video represents a clear loss. Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, said Friday on Iraqiya TV that most of the artifacts shown in the ISIS video were real -- including a famed, millennia-old winged bull that's seen being defaced with a drill. "Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, and there were preparations to reopen the Mosul Museum before ISIS invaded the city in June 2014," Rashid said. He added that Mosul has more than 1,700 historical sites that are potentially at risk. "On repeated viewing of that very grainy video, we now suspect that there (were) far more originals in the museum than I first thought," said Eleanor Robson, chairwoman of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq. "Whilst there was indeed a program to relocate antiquities to safekeeping in Baghdad, it looks now as though it didn't reach that particular museum." "I condemn this as a deliberate attack against Iraq's millennial history and culture, and as an inflammatory incitement to violence and hatred," said Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural organization. "This attack is far more than a cultural tragedy -- this is also a security issue as it fuels sectarianism, violent extremism and conflict in Iraq," she said, calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to protect Iraq's cultural heritage. How ISIS is run CNN has extensively reported on ISIS' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in that country. Officials there have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah. Its motives are not purely ideological, however; ISIS makes money off looting.	1
George Zimmerman was booked into jail Sunday after surrendering to authorities before an afternoon deadline, the Seminole County sheriff said. Zimmerman met two members of the sheriff's office in a business parking lot about 1:25 p.m. Sunday and was taken into custody, Sheriff Donald Eslinger told reporters. Zimmerman was required to return to central Florida and turn himself in after a judge revoked his bail Friday, saying Zimmerman misled the court about his finances. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is accused of shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford in February. Zimmerman argues he acted in self-defense. Police: Martin's death 'ultimately avoidable' Eslinger said Zimmerman, who will be housed in administrative confinement at Seminole County's John E. Polk Correctional Facility, was "quiet and cooperative." He was being held on a no-bail status, the sheriff's office said. Video from the jail showed Zimmerman exiting a white minivan, wearing handcuffs, jeans and a long-sleeve shirt, escorted by authorities. Zimmerman's cell is designed to hold two inmates and is about 67 square feet, the sheriff's office said. It is equipped with two beds and a toilet. Inmates are not provided access to televisions, authorities said. It was not clear from the sheriff's office whether another inmate would be in the cell with Zimmerman. After being booked, Zimmerman will be given an opportunity to purchase items at the commissary. His balance in the commissary account, posted on the sheriff's web site, was $500. "While out on bond, Mr. Zimmerman has been living in a secure, undisclosed location as there are significant threats against his life," his attorneys said Sunday on the official website for his defense. Documents shed light on Florida killing Asked how his client spent the weekend, attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters, "travel." He said Zimmerman was worried about coming out of hiding, "but I think he also realizes the judge's concerns." O'Mara said he will be filing a motion Monday asking Seminole County Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. for a new bond hearing to revisit Zimmerman's status and allow the defense to "explain why what happened seems to have happened." Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the case that sparked anger across the country.	1
U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called on countries throughout the world to decriminalize homosexuality, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to proponents of same-sex marriage. Every group of people has a right to its own views, Obama said, and that diversity should be respected, "but when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- I believe that everybody has to be treated equal." He spoke at a news conference with President Macky Sall of Senegal, a country in which homosexuality is illegal. "Regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation ... people should be treated equally, and that's a principle that I think applies universally," Obama said. The remarks came in response to a question from CNN as to whether he was pressing Sall on the issue. Obama said that the issue did not come up in their talks, but that the question of how gays and lesbians are treated has been coming up in Africa in general. Sall responded that his country has no plans to decriminalize homosexuality. "Senegal is a very tolerant country which does not discriminate in terms of inalienable rights of human beings," he said, according to an official translation. People are not refused jobs for being gay, he said. "But we are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality." "But of course this does not mean that we are all homophobic," Sall insisted. Sall then turned to another issue on which the two nations differ: capital punishment. "In our country, we have abolished it for many years," he said, adding, "We do respect the choice of each country." Obama's Africa visit Obama left the United States on Wednesday for a trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania -- his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. The trip aims to bolster investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent. The Asian nation is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms, and in 2009 replaced the United States as the largest trading partner. At Thursday's news conference, Obama was asked to assess the big news at home: the Supreme Court ruling Wednesday striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act.	1
A woman carried out a suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul's historic Sultanahmet district Tuesday Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (A woman carried out a suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul's historic Sultanahmet district Tuesday Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Photo: TRT TV / AFP / Getty Images)A 29-year-old woman has carried out a suicide bombing at a police station near Istanbul's iconic Taksim Square, killing a police officer. Police confirmed the death of the officer, who died on the scene, but the motive for the bombing is unclear. The suspect is in custody.According to the police, the bomber, identified as Fatma Doktorov, appeared to be "a woman in her late 20s", adding the explosives used in the attack were not crude. A police lieutenant said it was the second bombing in a week in a single district of this busy city, and the third in the province or Istanbul of over the last few months."The bomb detonated on Tuesday afternoon at a police post a short distance from Taksim Square. The explosion occurred near a motorcycle patrol vehicle and the police officer responsible for maintaining it," said Chief of Police Ümit Yildirim who confirmed that a policeman was killed in the blast. "Our initial findings suggest that the attacker, who managed to hide her identity by wearing a large, colourful scarf, carried out the attack alone. We will provide more information about the person when we complete our preliminary investigations."Yildirim also said the attacker was from the town of Göztepe, some 30 miles (50 km) from Istanbul. He said the police officer was not responding to the sound of the explosion, but a few minutes later called for help. "We do not know how the blast took place," Yildirim said.The attack follows several other suicide bombings in Istanbul Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (The latest followed a suspected suicide bomber earlier this month who blew himself up in a crowded shopping street in the Black Sea city of Izmir Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (The latest followed a suspected suicide bomber earlier this month who blew himself up in a crowded shopping street in the Black Sea city of Izmir Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Photo: AP / Getty Images)The attacker	0
States appear to be taking more action to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health problems in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, new figures show. Mental health problems would prohibit potential buyers from purchasing a gun. ÂThis article was produced by Business News Daily, a joint publication.Federal, state and local law enforcement groups are taking part in the largest single-day gun buy-back program to date, according to an Associated Press review of data provided to the news service by the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the Washington Post, which was obtained as part of an open records request. During the three-day operation, firearms from hundreds of weapon-carrying individuals were seized in dozens of states, and the FBI recovered a cache of weapons and ammunition from an Oklahoma hunting camp. In contrast to previous buy-back events, state, federal and local law enforcement acted as gun dealers and provided much of the firearms seized for sale. The buy-backs were run jointly by the NSSF and the Washington Post.Â “We have never seen in all the years we have been doing buy-backs, so much of this information,” said Jim Bopp, executive director and senior vice president of the Washington Post.Bopp, who was involved in the first such buy-back, has been tapped to lead the effort that was scheduled to have a second buy-back event in the Washington district on Saturday. The new buy-back will be run in partnership with the Washington PostÂ as part of the newspaperâ€™sÂ ongoing effort to prevent gun violence.Â“The buy-back is a very important component of the community programs we are undertaking, which includes education and we have also seen the community groups help us,” said Bopp.The buy-back offers a fresh opportunity for the firearms industry. Since 1998, the program has removed more than 650,000 semiautomatic weapons from the national firearms market, according to the AP.It is worth noting that the weapons that were seized in both the Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook tragedies were the most heavily used in the past two years. In Sandy Hook, a semiautomatic, semiautomatic high-capacity magazine, such as the Bushmaster XM-15, was the most frequently used weapon. In Virginia Tech, a semiautomatic pistol and a high-powered rifle were the most	0
Day after day, men and women from Soweto, a township near Johannesburg, wake up at the crack of dawn to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic and cramped public transport to show up at work in time. For Mxolishi Colossa, who works at a Johannesburg home furniture store, it's no different. Every morning, he quietly slips out of his house at 6 a.m. and heads to the nearest main street. There, standing by a dusty road, he waits patiently for a minibus taxi to pass by and carry him to the local train station. But it's not just the waiting that tests Colossa's early start to the day -- the high cost of the ride and the dangerous driving can be equally distressing. "All of them, same style," says Colossa, referring to the perilous way in which many of the taxi drivers navigate the area's roads. As the dawn fades away, Colossa jumps off the taxi to catch a train to Johannesburg. Fourteen stops later he pulls into the city but he still has to get another taxi to take him to the other side of Johannesburg, to Melrose Arch, the plush shopping area where he works. He finally arrives at the store at 8.30 a.m. -- a full two-and-a-half hours after leaving his home. "It's not acceptable for people to have to take multiple legs of a journey to get to work," says Rehana Moosajee of the Mayoral Committee for Transport in Johannesburg. See more: Concerns over 'insanity' of Shell South Africa fracking plans Despite some of the best roads on the continent and a number of high-profile infrastructure projects, including a high-speed train and a bus service built for the 2010 football World Cup, commuting in Johannesburg is often an arduous task for millions of people. The slick new services often don't connect with each other and older public transport systems, leaving poor and working-class people struggling to get to work. Last year, in IBM's Commuter Pain Survey, Johannesburg was ranked fifth worst in terms of the amount of pain commuters suffer getting to and from work. Moosajee admits that the current transit situation doesn't cater well to the economic needs of Johannesburg, adding that the city is working to better integrate its transport system.	1
A Pakistani woman whose gang rape made international headlines nine years ago has given Â£1,600 to a charity providing aid and support to women and girls threatened by rape and violence, a campaign group has found.The money will go to the Women's Refuge, which runs a shelter for victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse, and runs a scheme to get women to the police when they are threatened.The charity gave the money to the National PCT Woman Police Charity, which will use the money to provide emergency help for women and girls in trouble with the law. The scheme is supported by the Government's Domestic Violence Unit.The charity will spend Â£1,400 out of its Â£1,500 reserve fund on the scheme, which it said is the second biggest in the UK behind the one run by the National Crime Agency.A total of Â£1,800 was donated, which will cover the first year of the scheme and the first two weeks of the project.Charity director Mary Ellen Markham said: "We are delighted to be able to help the first person to make a donation, which will enable the service to continue in the short term."We have asked our donors to consider which specific projects they would like to see taken forward."The scheme has been in place in Scotland for some time and we are also delighted to have been able to take it further here."We have an enthusiastic support from the police and the Government's Domestic Violence Unit, which has been working with the charity to try and make the scheme work here. These are very good people and I thank them both very much for their support."A campaign to abolish a three-week time limit on criminal charges has ended in a stalemate, with parliamentarians unable to agree on how to replace it.The time limit, announced by the government last month, was originally intended to tackle miscarriages of justice.But some campaigners believe it can be so restrictive that people cannot be tried for minor offences.Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, the committee chairman, said: "With each day that passes, the time limit on bringing charges diminishes. We now need to have a considered discussion about how we can remove this arbitrary three-week limit."In the end, this isn't about politics but about protecting citizens, and ensuring that we can deal with	0
One person was killed and dozens injured after unrest broke out overnight at an Australian detention center for asylum seekers on a remote island in Papua New Guinea, authorities said Tuesday. Detainees breached fences surrounding the ersatz refugee camp at Manus Island, the authorities in nearby Port Moresby said, and at least one person died, while dozens more were injured from baton blows and slashed tires.In a sign of the rising tensions, the Australian government said it was "closely monitoring" the developments on Manus Island. The island lies 70 miles off Papua New Guinea, some of the world's most remote terrain in the Pacific."The Australian government will not tolerate any incident at the refugee center on Manus Island," Immigration Minister Scott Morrison was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald. "We'll be in close touch with Papua New Guinea, PNG," Morrison said. "We continue to work with PNG on security-related issues as we do on all aspects of immigration."Australia's foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the "disturbing scenes" depicted on television showed "the ugly side of humanity" and urged calm. "We will continue to work with the PNG government and with the people of Manus Island to restore calm and order on the island," Bishop said.In a statement late Tuesday, the PNG's government asked Australia to provide "immediate assistance" to its refugees.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on all parties "to exercise maximum restraint and to respect the rule of law."Papua New Guinea is a Pacific island nation that is part of Australia and whose citizens are fleeing persecution at home after a decades-long conflict with its ethnic Papuans. A former U.S. military base is located on the island, where up to 70,000 asylum-seekers pass through each year.Many who landed on the island have been on Manus island for days. They have spent months waiting for asylum claims to be approved and, if all goes according to plan, are to be transferred to Australia.Those waiting on Manus have been living with temperatures of as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit and short running water. Some have found their way to the bathroom in plastic bags. The Manus Health Directorate is distributing bottled water. The Australian government has said it is also doing what it can to	0
Gareth Bale's imminent transfer to Real Madrid for a reported world-record fee has been criticized by Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino. With Spain struggling amid a tough global economic climate, Martino questioned the appropriateness of Real spending on just one player a figure reputed to be at least $125 million and possibly as much as $145 million. "He's a very good player, but the numbers seem to me almost a lack of respect for the world in general," the Argentine told reporters on Saturday at a press conference ahead of Barca's trip to Malaga. Bale, who plays for English Premier League club Tottenham, is next week expected to be unveiled as Real's fifth world-record signing since 2000. It will reportedly happen after Madrid, seeking to win back the La Liga title from Barca, play Granada on Monday in the club's second game this season. Barca spent $75 million to sign Neymar from Santos in June, but Martino said the Brazil striker is not guaranteed to start Sunday's match in Malaga despite the absence of the injured Lionel Messi. The four-time world player of the year is being rested as a precaution after suffering a bruised thigh in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid last Wednesday. "Honestly, I am not worried because I think he is fine," Martino said of his compatriot. "What happened the other day was coincidence. I think it is totally unnecessary to take risks at the start of the season." Neymar came off the bench to score the equalizer against Atletico, but Martino played down expectations surrounding the 21-year-old. "I don't share this idea that says that Neymar must take over and take the lead if Messi is not there to do it," he said. "We have Xavi, we have Andres Iniesta, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez, Pedro. There are too many players to expect Neymar to automatically be in the starting line-up. "Nothing is going to shorten the time we think is necessary for Neymar to be ready." Bale has reportedly already traveled to Spain, and will not play in Tottenham's home match with Swansea on Sunday. The 24-year-old Wales international, who became the most sought-after talent on the planet following Neymar's decision to join Barca, also missed the London club's opening match of the EPL season last weekend.	1
There's some magic coming to a British stage. Author J.K. Rowling has announced she is developing a play based on The Hunger Games, the first novel in her young adult dystopian trilogy of which Harry Potter is the first part. The theatre is scheduled for production early next year. I am a fan of fantasy and science fiction, so I have high hopes for this new play.I am sure that at some point in the future, an author will make a movie or a TV series to be the first-ever representation of the world in which her book takes place, and there will be much fanfare as she proves everyone "right" and that her books are better than the ones that are "wrong." The world will be changed, and people will be free to do things they never considered possible.However, The Hunger Games is different. The play will be written for teenagers and adults, for the entertainment of all, and it will be in the world of the book, and in a way that could never happen with a movie. It will be true to the book, and in a way that could never happen with a TV series or a film adaptation.This will be the first of many adaptations of the book in the future (see my post from last month).I have never seen the movie based on Harry Potter, and I want to see it because I can't stand the sight of it. In fact, I have to admit I have avoided all Harry Potter films in fear of a horrible film or TV show (the very thought would make me feel sick to my stomach). In fact, I am a huge fan of movie adaptations of books, in part because it means I get to read the book, or as I have been told (which is true), it means I get to enjoy reading the book.As much as I love reading The Hunger Games and love Harry Potter, I really want to see a new Harry Potter movie. One with good special effects, a good cast, well performed, and I don't want to see the books adapted into something that is not faithful to the books. All of this means that I am looking forward to a new Harry Potter movie, but more than anything I want to see The Hunger Games on the big screen.The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy of dystopian books that focus on the lives of teenagers forced to fight each other for the "right" to	0
Comedienne Joan Rivers says she will "stand behind" what she told a paparazzo about not feeling sadness for civilians killed in Gaza. Rivers made her controversial comments at the Los Angeles airport Wednesday when a photographer iced her with the question, "You do feel good, don't you?" He said it was "the cutest thing" and "that's the dumbest thing" he had ever heard.Rivers, who has made movies like "Papa John" and "The Witches of Eastwick" in addition to starring roles in stage and film such as "The Life and Loves of Tim Tim" and "My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult" and "Spinal Tap," replied with a withering "No dumb dumb," to the question."This is a good job for you to do," Rivers told the photographer. "And don't call me dumb or stupid. I'm not.""You're right," Rivers said. "I would have been the dumbest person in the world, standing there, you know, dumbass."Sara Mikhael, a reporter for the LA Times who was there for the airport photo opportunity, said the comment was the "most entertaining part of the story." She said, "She is actually, like, really cool. She is so easy to understand that she's not some bitter old lady.""I kind of feel a little bad that I missed the opportunity to see that," she said. "But, you know, it was a weird day."Rivers has previously been asked, "Is there any movie about a mother whose child is kidnapped and they don't know whose child it is?" She has said, "Yes," and even asked, "Is there a movie about a mother who has two sons and they're kidnapped?" She then asked, "You think I said yes or no to that question, don't you?"She has also said, "As a movie star, you become part of the story. In this case, you're doing a great, important job and you're getting a lot of publicity."Rivers has said in the past that she would stand behind anything she says, even when "that might seem to imply ... that I have some level of responsibility for what is happening.” She did recently apologize for an anti-Semitic tweet on the issue.	0
Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack. About 50 people were killed and about 100 injured when the blasts went off in the southern town of Reyhanli, in across the border from Syria's Idlib province, on May 11. One was at the community's city hall and the other in front of a post office. The protest Saturday began relatively peacefully but descended into chaos as running street clashes broke out with police. Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the police, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and high-pressure paintballs. Officers also brought out a water cannon. Women and children ran from the scene as thick clouds of tear gas spread through the streets at the heart of the confrontation. Police prevented the protesters from reaching the site of the blasts in the center of the town, which lies in Turkey's southern Hatay province. The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which quietened down after less than an hour. The protest -- which started with several thousand people but dwindled to a hard core of several hundred as trouble broke out -- was intended to show support and solidarity for the people of Reyhanli in the wake of the deadly bombings. Many people in the town are angry at the government's response and say its decision to take in Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country has made Turkey a target for attacks. The crowd chanted calls for Erdogan and the government to resign. One family of demonstrators was mourning the death of Ayten Calim, a 20-year-old secretary from Reyhanli who was killed in the bombings last Saturday. Her brother, Halim Calim, said, "We are here to voice our pain." He and another brother carried Turkish flags and a banner with Ayten's photo on it that read, "We will not forget." Some have criticized Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for traveling to the United States this week instead of coming to Reyhanli to show support. Erdogan has held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington. Turkish President Abdullah Gul visited Reyhanli Thursday, when he vowed that those responsible for the car bombs would be held accountable.	1

Bowing to intense pressure from local residents, authorities in a southwestern Chinese city abandoned plans to build a controversial billion-dollar chemical plant, the local government announced Tuesday afternoon. Earlier -- defying government ersatz protests -- the plant had been expected to open in about six months. (The ersatz protests -- a combination of government lies and local ersatz protests -- were conducted on behalf of the plant's owners.)In a statement, the city's mayor, Fang Feng, cited "public opinion" as the reason for abandoning the plans. Mayor Fang said it would cost more than $1 billion to complete the project, which involves producing and storing chemical waste and dumping it on some of China's most remote and desolate areas. (This is not an exaggeration.) The plant also would have had the potential to dump toxic waste on the local fishing village of Liling, located in the county of Liling, which is located just north of the Guizhou province's Ganzi prefecture.Advertisement:The project would have required blasting a trench, about 3,700 feet deep, to release waste, and to dispose of the toxic chemicals; a waste dump that is expected to have produced about 200 tons of toxic waste per day. On Monday, locals protested the plant in a variety of ways. At least 22 people were arrested for illegal protests. According to Liling's mayor -- the most vocal of the protesters -- one woman from the village was fined 20,000 yuan for demonstrating illegally.Although the city's authorities claim it was because of public unrest, the local police chief, Yang Zhaoxun, told CNN that the police were conducting "a series of on-site training sessions" on how to handle these types of protests. Meanwhile, the plant's backers appear to have quietly changed their strategy, according to the local media. On Tuesday morning, a representative for China Gas, one of two companies overseeing the project, told state broadcaster CCTV that the project had been abandoned, and that the remaining workers would be given a new contract."We are making adjustments to ensure no harmful substance will be released anywhere in China this rainy season," said Li Xiaobing, vice chairman of China Gas, in a press conference Tuesday afternoon.Advertisement:Li added that China Gas would not use any hazardous waste to begin with. The company said it would instead reuse chemicals that are already in short supply. (As China Gas	0
A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. "There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't," a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. "Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)." Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, "I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about." The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that "gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights." Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as "a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia." Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them," Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). "We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone," he said before the 2014 Games. "That's why you can feel safe and free here," he added, "but please leave our children in peace."	1
A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat. The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer  away.The gruesome killing of the four-year-old boy comes just months after a similar incident in northern India and after a dozen people died in a similar manner in Nepal in 2017.The boy's mother who went to the forest with her son told Nepal's ANI that she was walking back from where he went on a school outing, when she saw a leopard dragging the boy into trees. She said they called the locals, who came and killed the leopard.Police in Nepal say they have identified the perpetrator and are trying to get his photograph.While the authorities maintain a low profile on the incident, this has not stopped Nepal's media, including CNN , from making the story even more sensational.One journalist in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, wrote on Twitter, "So Nepal is now in a state of civil war. A leopard killed 15 people in the last few months. What next? How is life in Nepal going to change now?"But while the media's attention has been attracted by the story over the last few days, many are waiting to see what the authorities come up with.Mithun Shrestha -- the man who found the child's body and identified the leopard -- said the boy, who is from the Bhotian Village, in the Rupandehi district, disappeared on September 15. He said he saw two leopards running away and his nephew later saw the boy dead in a pit in the forest.In a Facebook post, Shrestha said, "A leopard dragged and killed an innocent 4 yr child in the name of food in the forest. I strongly condemn this inhuman act."He added, "I will make sure other people of Nepal will be alert and avoid visiting the forests for the safety of their lives. We are losing our precious forests at a rate of every 10 years and need to stop it. I would also like to appeal to the authorities to take preventive measures against this and prevent such incidents from happening in the future."Local police said a special investigating team has been formed to trace the man who killed the boy.Earlier	0
White House Ebola czar Ron Klain on Tuesday downplayed the chances of Ebola being used as a biological weapon after a scare in New Zealand. Klain said he was briefed Tuesday after a small vial supposedly sent by jihadis and containing Ebola was sent to the offices of the New Zealand Herald newspaper. The newspaper sent the vial to Australia for testing. "Based on our best information, I think the odds are high that this turns out to be a hoax," Klain said on CNN's "The Lead" with Jake Tapper. He said U.S. officials are "always watching intelligence traffic and other indicators" to see if terror groups are using Ebola or other diseases as biological weapons, but that "we're not aware of any credible threat" and that the odds of that happening are low. Klain touted the overall U.S. response to Ebola cases here and to the outbreak in West Africa, saying health officials have "tried to learn the lessons from Dallas," where the first case was diagnosed in the United States, by increasing training, preparation and protective gear at health facilities nationwide. "What we've shown now is that we can successfully identify and isolate an Ebola patient, we can make sure he doesn't infect other people, we can treat him, and we can send him home safely," he said. When President Barack Obama tapped Klain as his Ebola response coordinator, Republican lawmakers howled that the long-time political operative -- Klain served as Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff and helped Obama with debate preparation during his re-election campaign -- isn't a medical professional. But Klain told Tapper on Tuesday that he isn't serving in a role that requires a medical background. "My role isn't to give medical advice, it's to coordinate this massive response that President Obama has marshaled here at home and in Africa," Klain said.	1
A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows. Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center. Police also released two audio recordings Wednesday -- a 911 call preceding the shooting and a tape of a dispatcher asking officers to go to the park. The shooting happened after a person called 911 to report that a black male -- "probably a juvenile" -- was pointing "a pistol" at people outside the recreation center. Twice the caller said the gun might be fake. The dispatcher radioed to officers about a black male who was "pointing a gun at people," but did not mention that caller's belief that he could be a minor and that the gun might not be a real firearm, one of the released recordings shows. Police previously said it wasn't clear if the responding officers received the information about the suspect's age or the gun possibly being fake. Authorities are investigating the shooting, and the two officers -- identified Wednesday by police as Timothy Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmback, 46 -- are on leave from their jobs. Loehmann joined the department in March, Tomba said. Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba stressed that his department released the video at the request of Tamir's relatives, who had seen it privately with authorities' permission. "We are honoring the wishes of the family," Tomba said. " ... This is an obvious tragic event." In a written statement obtained by CNN affiliate WEWS, the family thanked the police for making the video public. "It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us," the family said. "We ask for the community to remain calm. Please protest peacefully and responsibly. Your prayers, kind words and condolences have meant so much to us. Video shows officer shoot Tamir The video shows Tamir walking along a sidewalk and eventually sitting on a picnic table bench under a gazebo Saturday afternoon, sometimes pointing what appears to be a handgun.	1

When Gina Keatley first moved to New York to attend culinary school, she noticed that many of her neighbors were missing limbs. "I lived on 99th Street across from some projects," she said. "I would walk to the train and  go through the projects to my school and they would pass by me." She was a single mom, so she went around on the streets with her kid sister to avoid getting mugged. "It was horrifying."Keatley was one of the lucky ones, however. She got a job as a pastry chef at the renowned Five & Ten restaurant in New York. "I loved my job so much, I told my boss, 'I've got to go back to school,'" Keatley wrote on her new blog in 2011. She spent the next three years in school, earning her Bachelor of Science in Food Science from Cornell University. It was her first job paying for school, but it took Keatley a long time to earn her money, she said. She wasn't trained as a chef, nor did she become a pastry chef. "I learned to cook and make cookies," she said. "I really enjoyed it."Keatley soon began working at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York, but she was looking for another way to earn money. She was inspired to find something that wouldn't require a lot of money. "I wanted to go into business for myself, but I didn't know how," she said. "I didn't want to do things just to have a good job." So in 2010, she started a business consulting business. Business Consulting was a one person operation, and she focused on the kind of work she enjoyed -- consulting. She was able to create a business that would pay the bills -- for now.Fast forward to 2017, and Business Consulting is a nine-figure business. Keatley makes more money than she did as a baker, but she doesn't complain about living paycheck to paycheck. "It's definitely not a lifestyle I ever planned on having, but it's so wonderful," she said. "If you're doing what you love, it totally offsets the struggles with money, which is great."Even though she has a nice comfortable life, Keatley is a firm believer in taking the first step toward things you want -- whether they're just dreams or things you've had for a while.

The United States will talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday during a visit to South Korea, a key U.S. ally. "North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power," Kerry said after arriving in Seoul. His trip to South Korea -- part of an Asian swing that also includes North Korean ally China -- came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes. Disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. Despite weeks of bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang threatening nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and their allies, U.S. officials have characterized the North's saber rattling as largely bluster. U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move. But a senior administration official said there's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material. Still, the defense agency said it has "moderate confidence" that North Korea could fit a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and fire it. But agency analysts think such a missile's reliability would be low -- an apparent reference to its accuracy. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Friday that the North Korean government "has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear-armed missile." And Kerry said Friday that it would be inaccurate to suggest that North Korea, which has conducted three underground nuclear weapons tests since 2006, can launch a nuclear-armed missile, despite the DIA assessment. "But obviously they have conducted a nuclear test, so there's some kind of device, but that is very different from miniaturization and delivery and from tested delivery and other things," he said. He said any launch by North Korea would be a "huge mistake." "If Kim Jong Un decides to launch a missile, whether it's across the Sea of Japan or in some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community, his own obligations that he has accepted, and it will be a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people's temperature with respect to this issue," Kerry said.	1
At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Scores more were still missing as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. But at least 578 people survived the sinking Wednesday, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. On Thursday, 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border, according to a statement from the refugee agency. An additional 383 survivors were expected to be taken to the same or nearby camps for help. The overcrowded boat, which set sail May 28 from Tripoli, was headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa carrying about 850 people. The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the refugee agency said in a statement. The agency said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience. Soon after the boat left Tripoli, it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday, the passengers ran out of food and water. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, the refugee agency reported. "Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel," and the boat capsized, the agency said. "This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year," said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the refugee agency. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter Europe. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. "Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences," the refugee agency said in its statement. "Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli."	1
Brazil stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest, as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use. For most of the last decade it has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of ecoagriculture, in large part to protect the rainforest. Yet that progress has been much harder to preserve.For the last two decades or so, the Brazilian government has invested heavily in protecting its rainforest—a massive, biologically diverse region covering an area nearly the size of the United States. The land was a refuge for the Amazon’s unique species, from the tree-dwelling capybaras and the jaguar to the monkey-lizard, peccary, tapir, tapirine, and capybara. In the last 20 years, however, the government has been forced to reverse many of these policies, in part due to a changing climate and the decline of the rainforest. As a result, rainforest cover has shrunk and the amount of land under conservation has fallen dramatically.The government has implemented an ambitious plan to save the Amazon, which includes increasing logging and land conservation, restoring degraded areas, and creating protected areas. The government is considering changes to the system of protected areas and has launched a legislative reform of the environmental protection law, which would require environmental reviews for all new projects that could affect the environment. But those policies, and the government’s attempts to defend them, have been under attack from the ruling party, trade unions, indigenous groups, and social movements from the beginning of the campaign for president in 2014.The forest has not been protected in vain, however. As a result the government has taken significant steps forward in its efforts to sustain the Amazon. Now the challenge is to hold back the changes that threaten the forest.The Amazon BasinThe Amazon is one of the largest and most biologically diverse rainforests in the world, stretching for almost 300,000 square miles. The forest is home to a multitude of animals, plants, and peoples, including the world’s heaviest timber tree, the cedar-maple, the world’s largest monkey (the orchid), and the world’s smallest frog (the Chirpsella jamaicensis).The rainforest is located largely in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Ecuador, and French Gu	0
You don't have to be Jennifer Aniston to think that the four women who Krazy-Glued a cheater's penis to his stomach were way harsh and beyond psycho. If  your ex's loved ones ask why you broke up, it's  probably a safe bet that the answer lies within your relationship, and it may seem surprising at first. But the truth is, a break-up doesn't have anything to do with you, it has to do with your ex—and how he dealt with your breakup.If your ex chose not to deal with his cheating by dealing with it, then why would you assume you need to? There's nothing you can do to change the past, and you should be able to move on from your relationship without having to explain yourself on television.I don't want to give you a clichéd advice, but breaking up with someone isn't a bad thing to do. Sometimes you have no choice. Your ex makes the decision to cheat on you, or you make the decision to leave. You have a choice here.But even if you both chose not to deal with your relationship problem, by breaking up you're putting your own emotional health first. You're putting your partner's feelings above yours. You're being selfish. And you're being responsible—even if you don't know how to make a commitment, you're actually making one. And you're not giving yourself the ability to think clearly through this process:**1.** You can't take it back. You can't go back, you can't undo what's happened, and you can't do the same thing. You can't  forgive yourself for whatever pain you caused to your partner. You're not your former partner's problem. You're your own. And that's something you have to take on and own yourself—at least in part, at least with regard to relationships.**2.** You can't expect your partner to leave his cheating partners behind and then you'll be able to handle your relationship. Your partner may not feel comfortable leaving his cheater while you're still hanging on to your other one. A lot of what you were experiencing with your ex remains with him—a reminder of who he was, who he has become, and who he is in relationship. When you break up, you'll leave him behind, and it's only natural that he'll start to slip back into old habits	0
An Australian pilot landed a company plane in the ocean off Darwin on Friday, in a water landing that prompted comparisons to last month's landing of a US Airways jet in New York's Hudson River. The Australian pilot has been compared to U.S. hero Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger, pictured above. The Australian pilot also encountered problems shortly after takeoff. The twin-propeller plane was carrying the pilot and five passengers when it went down shortly after leaving Darwin International Airport, said Neville Blyth, a senior transport safety investigator with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. All those aboard were unhurt and managed to walk to shore, he said. Pictures showed the men from the plane soaked and carrying bags and equipment as they walked through the water. "It's essentially a good story," Blyth said. The ATSB is deciding whether to investigate, he said, and the cause of the incident is still unknown. The Piper Chieftain plane was on its way to the town of Maningrida, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Darwin, according to its owner, Australian information technology company CSG. Watch the plane ditch in Darwin Harbor » "We would like to congratulate the pilot following all emergency landing and evacuation procedures and his very professional handling of the situation," a CSG statement said. Darwin is in Australia's Northern Territory, on the coast of the Timor Sea. The city's airport is near the water. The plane's trajectory took it over the water, giving the pilot limited opportunities to ditch the plane on land, Blyth said. He said the ocean was a safer option for landing than the beach, where the firmness of the sand was unknown. "Personally, I think the decision was appropriate," Blyth said. Australian media dubbed the captain of the Darwin plane "Sully Lite," comparing him to the captain of the US Airways Airbus jet that landed safely in the Hudson. Pilot Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger was hailed as a hero for landing the plane safely and ensuring that all 155 people on board survived. Asked about the comparisons, Blyth said the connection was tenuous. "The correlation for a water landing is as close as it gets," he said.	1
Schadenfreude -- joy at the misfortune of others -- is a bad thing. So I've been trying to resist temptation these past months as I watch Attorney General Eric Holder deal with public and congressional reaction to the "Fast and Furious" scheme, the failed attempt by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to seed and then track U.S. firearms to Mexican drug cartels. Fast and Furious was a secretive, high-risk operation seemingly intended to deal with an intractable problem abroad. On those grounds, some may be tempted to equate it to a CIA covert action. But even if some attributes are similar -- tough problem, edgy solution, inherent complexity, great secrecy, high operational and political risk -- it was definitely not a covert action since those are clearly defined in an executive order as the province of the Central Intelligence Agency Beyond that, if it had been a true covert action, the attorney general would have had to give his opinion as to its lawfulness beforehand; the implementing agency would have had to exhaustively articulate risk; the National Security Council would have had to judge it favorably; President Barack Obama would have had to authorize it; and the Congress would have had to be briefed before its implementation. And all concerned would have had the opportunity to reject a bad idea, whatever its rationale. These routine safeguards not only protect agencies, their leaders and their officers from legal and political jeopardy, they also protect the government from serious missteps. Now Holder, without such safeguards in place, must defend himself against some very tough accusations, including one by some skeptics that the operation was intended principally to discredit, and thereby justify further regulation of, firearms dealers. This is where the schadenfreude comes in. After the congressional elections of 2006, the CIA was forced to defend edgy (often controversial and sometimes unsuccessful) actions in a tough political environment. President George W. Bush was politically weakened, the Senate and the House were under Democratic control and a presidential election was in the offing. On the Hill, the questions were aggressive, often partisan and, in my view, sometimes even deeply mean-spirited and unfair to the many intelligence professionals who were putting their lives and careers on the line in a very successful effort to protect America from further attack. The agency dealt with the committees as best a nonpolitical organization could, fully recognizing that, although congressional oversight was a necessary instrument, it could sometimes be a difficult one.	1
Egypt's presidential elections will take place on May 26 and 27, Egyptian media reported Sunday, citing an announcement by the country's Presidential Elections Commission. Army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced Wednesday that he would resign and declared his candidacy in the national polls. El-Sisi, 59, Egypt's defense minister, had to leave the army in order to run for president. El-Sisi deposed President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's first freely elected leader, last year following mass protests against the latter's rule. The officer is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing el-Sisi as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since a popular uprising in 2011 ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. But el-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and the author of a fierce crackdown on dissent. Egypt has suffered bloody internal strife since Morsy was overthrown. Also on Sunday, unknown gunmen opened fire on a security personnel carrier in Egypt's Sinai region, killing one soldier and injuring three policemen, the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported, citing a military source. The security personnel carrier was traveling on a motorway in the North Sinai town of Sheikh Zuweid, the source told the Al-Ahram Arabic news website, without elaborating. Militants based in the Sinai peninsula near the Israeli border have stepped up attacks on soldiers and policemen since Morsy's ouster. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.	1
We each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them, King George II of Great Britain died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one. The humble lavatory is the curbstone of the UK and for most of us it’s where we do most of what we do. That’s why the lavatory is our most important space. It’s where we go to the toilet, do our business, go to the loo, take a bath, wash, brush our teeth, brush our hair, put on make-up, wash it all off, take some food to the mouth, eat it. Then, it’s our most important place to sit and relax.That’s why we should be paying more attention to the things we do in our private lives. By doing so, we can reduce our carbon footprints and improve our quality of life. The government is taking this very seriously. Today, over 80% of all the UK’s energy is produced from renewables. By 2020, two-thirds of the UK’s energy will be renewable and the government has set targets to make 50% of the UK’s electricity produced from renewable sources.We need to continue doing more and do this now and at the same time we need to make some changes to move our economies forward. It will take time to get there, but this government has made a number of changes. Firstly, they have set a target of 50% of all energy to come from renewables by 2020 which will allow energy companies to plan ahead. Secondly, they have promised to bring back the solar levy and this will provide the necessary funding for this to happen. Thirdly, they have committed to reducing the UK’s emissions from business to less than 1990 levels by 2030.By 2030, we want to get 80% of the energy we produce from sources that are renewable and that’s exactly what the government is setting out to achieve. They have also set a target of 50% of emissions from business by 2020 and this will mean that they will be able to ensure that emissions in the private sector are less than 1990.One of the things that I look at is if we’re making investments in things to reduce our carbon footprints and saving energy, but they do not come to fruition and do not make us feel	0
Former supermodel Janice Dickinson accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, telling "Entertainment Tonight" in an interview aired on Tuesday that the comedian raped her. Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue. He has never been prosecuted. In the interview, Dickinson claims Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. She alleges he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out. "The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain," she said. Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer. "That interview a dozen years ago said, 'she didn't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off,' " Singer's statement said Wednesday. "The only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off. Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinson's own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie." Dickinson did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Rape allegations haunt Cosby in the digital age Since 2005, a handful of women have made the claims. This year, the accusations resurfaced, and earlier this month, a seemingly harmless post on Cosby's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN. Bowman claims she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. "I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes," she said. Bowman said she knew her body had been touched without her permission. This occurred several times in the course of their contact, she said. On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the claims about him. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just "shaking his head no." CNN's Jethro Mullen and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.	1
The U.S. military held a "Day of Reflection" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa. Protestors in Okinawa express anger at claims two U.S.  were involved in the assaultsA U.S. service member has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a Japanese woman in Okinawa, where he is stationed as part of a program meant to help the U.S. military maintain a presence on the island, U.S. officials said Saturday.The incident is the latest in a string of alleged assaults allegedly committed by service members on the island.Officials said 28-year-old Specialist Ronald Noble of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve was arrested Saturday.

Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported. While the President dedicated only a brief part of his State of the Union address to immigration, his message went beyond his speech, and the evidence was sitting among the guests invited to join the first lady in the viewing box. "I feel honored and excited to be here. If it wasn't for receiving my DACA last summer I wouldn't have been able to attend the State of the Union," Avila told CNN. The 23-year-old and his siblings are just one of the many thousands of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Avila was illegally brought into the United States with his younger brother and sister when he was 9 years old DACA is a government program enacted in 2012 that stopped deporting some undocumented young people and instead granted them temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation. Obama hits the road to push State of the Union message The recipients have become one of the most visible groups advocating for immigration reform. Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22-day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November. And, for the last two years, Avila's been working as a voter engagement coordinator for Mi Familia Vota, a non-profit Latino civic engagement program. "At the time, immigration reform seemed like it was dead. We won the hearts of the American people. We revived the conversation," Avila said. Obama pleaded for cooperation and pointed out how getting immigration reform done this year was important for the country's recovering economy. "If we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement -- and fix our broken immigration system," Obama said. Without attacking House Republicans, the President described how both parties in the Senate passed a comprehensive bill last summer and said both parties in the House want to do the same. He said immigration reform would not only help the economy but shrink the deficit by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.	1
A United Arab Emirates court convicted dozens Tuesday in a high-profile case against 94 people charged with plotting to overthrow the government. More than two dozen of those who stood trial were acquitted, according to state media. It was a trial that drew criticism from international rights groups, who accused UAE authorities of "serious pretrial violations of fair trial rights." The Supreme Federal Court in Abu Dhabi sentenced eight people in absentia to 15 years in prison, while 56 of the suspects were handed 10-year prison sentences, five were sentenced to seven years in prison, and 25, including all 12 women in the, case were acquitted. Financial assets belonging to some of those convicted have also been confiscated, according to the state news agency, WAM. The court also ordered the shutdown of a number of organizations and websites that seem to be associated with the accused. According to the country's Ministry of Justice, the sentences in the state security trial that lasted four months cannot be appealed. The 94, all UAE nationals, were facing various charges including establishment of a clandestine organization aiming to overthrow the government. The charges, according to judicial authorities, stem from Article 180 of the country's penal code, which bans "establishing, instituting, founding, organizing, administering or joining an association, corporation, organization or any branch thereof, with the aim of overthrowing the regime of the State" The group is also accused of having links to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, an organization prohibited in the UAE. "They launched, established and ran an organization seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power," Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a January statement published by state media. Recent statements by Human Rights Watch said many of the 94 are members of a local "non-violent group that has been engaged in peaceful political debate in the UAE for many years and advocates greater adherence to Islamic precepts." Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other watchdog groups have described the mass trial as unfair. The groups have also accused authorities of abusing the detainees. According to Human Rights Watch, the defendants included two prominent human rights lawyers, as well as judges, teachers and student leaders. Rights groups have accused the country's judicial authorities of carrying out a trial shrouded in secrecy by not allowing international journalists and observers to cover the hearings. Local media and observers have had access to trial sessions. Authorities have maintained that the trial has been a fair and transparent one.	1
ISIS, as the Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria are known, has become the new face of international terrorism in the eyes of the United States and its Western allies. Now the focus in America and abroad has become what will  happen next.For more than three years, President Barack Obama has been trying to formulate an exit strategy from the Obama administration’s policy of the “war on terror.” The military campaign against ISIS has been extended over the past two years. A massive air war has been waged across much of Iraq and Syria. The US-led coalition has bombarded ISIS with precision, overwhelming artillery and airpower. In 2015, the US provided over $5 billion to the international coalition fighting ISIS. But despite the massive military campaign, and the massive US contributions, the fight against ISIS, and the fight against all terrorism groups, is going nowhere.The rise of ISIS has been accompanied by a global backlash against Islam. According to media reports, the majority of Muslims—some 75%—have had a negative opinion of Islam. For the first time since World War II, terrorism incidents in India are on the rise. On the other hand, there has been a rise in support for Islamic State in Europe.On September 19, the New York Times published an op-ed entitled, What is the Islamic State? By a writer in a Foreign Policy article entitled What is the Islamic State? The author, Andrew J. Bacevich, noted that the name ISIS is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, which refers to Iraq’s Shia majority and Syria’s Alawite majority.Mr. Bacevich noted that before ISIS, it was more difficult to define the global terrorist group than it is now. ISIS uses a wide variety of tactics to terrorize its opponents, including suicide bombers and car bombings. Mr. Bacevich wrote:“The Islamic State’s ideology is rooted in the Qur’an and in the Hadith. The group’s violent attacks are committed with the same fanaticism as its leaders preach to their followers, and its adherents, from Baghdad to Jakarta.”By contrast, Mr. Bacevich wrote that the Islamic State does not appear to be a Sunni Muslim group, but rather an offshoot of Al Qaeda or an ally of it. He noted:“There is	0
Researchers believe the number of children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is much higher than previously believed, according to a new study published Monday in the American Journal of Psychiatry. By looking at a total population sample in ˜‘the United States and abroad,’ researchers were able to identify ~‘4.5 million children with ASD in their first year of life,’ according to a press release from the National Institute of Mental Health. This means there are 4.5 million children who could have been identified, but went undiagnosed.If the findings in this study are proven to be accurate, the number of children with a ‘spectrum condition’ who are living with ASD would be almost 20% higher than the current estimate of ~‘2.2 million.’ The findings are the result of a nationwide study of ~‘100,000 children with ASD who visited an ASD/Developmental Disability Specialist clinic network (including pediatricians, developmental pediatricians, other healthcare personnel, and state developmental disability specialists) during their first year of life.‘The study is the largest to date that includes all children with ASD across the United States,’ said the study’s lead author, Dr. Steven Asquith, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the National Institutes of Health. ‘Our findings show that about 4.5 million children were missed because they were born with ASD but did not meet diagnostic criteria by the time they entered the clinic. The implications are staggering: If these findings are correct, there are potentially 50 million children with ASD in the United States.’According to the researchers, the children in this study were followed from their first visit to the clinic to the time of their first diagnosis. This diagnosis was made by doctors who specialize in caring for children with ASD and/or other development disabilities in their first year of life. In the case of the children in this study, these doctors were pediatricians or developmental pediatricians, some of whom practice in an ASD or developmental disability clinic.Once this information was collected, data was extracted regarding demographics, diagnostic information, and hospitalizations for the first year of life. This information was compared to diagnostic information from the National Hospital Discharge Survey to identify children with ASD. Using a Bayesian statistical analysis, the researchers were able to exclude children with diagnoses of severe intellectual disability	0
Images of the mangled remains of crashed passenger planes are enough to strike fear into the hardiest of business travelers. People posing as passengers take part in an anti-terrorist drill at Sukarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta. After a spate of airline emergencies, CNN's Business Traveller examines the risks of plane travel and investigates ways to make your journey safer, in the air and on the ground. Crash Course British Airways now offers a safety course that was once only available to their pilots and cabin crew. It takes place in a hangar at London's Heathrow airport and gives participants a realistic taste of emergency procedures from crawling through a smoke filled cabin and inflating a life jacket to opening emergency doors and exiting down evacuation slides. Barry Leonard, a passenger aboard US Airways Flight 1549 which touched down in New York's Hudson River, tells us how such time-honored procedures saved his life.  Watch the show. » Safe As Houses It's tempting think that five stars equals impenetrable citadel. The terrorist raids in Mumbai shattered that illusion.

As hosts of the largest carnival in world football, the pressure is on for South Africa's national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the 2010 World Cup. If Bafana Bafana is to succeed in their mission, conventional wisdom would be that coach Carlos Alberto Parreira will turn to his best players to deliver results. However, despite firing in 31 goals in 77 appearances to become South Africa's all-time record goal scorer, Benni McCarthy has had question marks hanging over his participation for his country come June. The prolific striker, who plays for English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, has only recently returned from a period of international exile, just the latest incident in a stormy history with his country's football team. He first angered Bafana Bafana fans by going into international retirement in 2002 aged just 25. The reason? Traveling to international games was hampering his ability to play European football for Celta Vigo and, later, Porto. "The whole pattern was killing my career, that's why I quit international football," he told British newspaper The Independent in 2004. "African football needs the same calendar as Europe otherwise its best players are going to suffer." He was talked into returning, only to quit again after the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations when the president of the South African FA, Mubarak Mahomad, made an uncomplimentary comment about his performance. That period of self-imposed exile lasted 20 months, until new coach Carlos Alberto Parreira flew to Great Britain to talk to McCarthy, who was now at Blackburn Rovers. But after Parreira quit to care for his sick wife, McCarthy fell out with replacement boss Joel Santana after he refused to play in two warm up matches last March. Despite pleas from South African President Jacob Zuma, Santana refused to pick him. But a run of eight defeats in nine games, which saw the team slump to 86th on the FIFA rankings, Santana was sacked. With goals being South Africa's biggest problem, it was no surprise that returning coach Parreira made persuading McCarthy to return, for a second time, his top priority. Sure enough, McCarthy returned to the fray last month against Japan. The 32-year-old told local press: "I want to start afresh and help Bafana do well in the World Cup finals. It is every player's dream to play for his country... and I have matured."	1
The Sudanese president has vowed to "never give up" a disputed oil-rich region that has escalated tensions with South Sudan and sparked fears of the two neighbors' return to war. Clashes between the two nations soared in the past week Â– and thatÂ¡Â¦s despite a recent peace deal between President Omar al-Bashir and his rival, former vice president Riek Machar.South Sudanese troops, backing out of a peace deal, have marched on oil-rich Unity State, where they are battling with a Sudanese militia. South Sudanese troops have taken control of a key port city, where they have taken over hotels as they seize assets to pay rent.This has led to fears it could be a prelude to a repeat of the 1994 ceasefire between the two nations that broke down within weeks."The world watched in horror the events in Libya and now we must think about what to do in Darfur," the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, told reporters in Khartoum."The world will never forget the genocide in Darfur."The conflict began after rebels launched a failed uprising in 2011, demanding the resignation of Bashir. More than 120,000 people have died since then, mostly from starvation, disease and murder.Machar accuses Bashir of failing to protect his people, leading to a split between the forces of the two men.While the two countries signed a ceasefire last month, the fighting has continued unabated.Darfur's oil assets, which make up a fourth of the country's economy, have seen the bloodiest fighting in modern times. In Darfur, more civilians have died in fighting than in warring with other nations.A South Sudanese soldier and a Sudanese rebel attend a press conference in the rebel-held town of Bor in Darfur."Every day people like us live in a state of fear and uncertainty as we are caught in the middle between a war of oil-rich Africa and a divided Sudan," said a local resident, Ibrahim Mohamed Ibrahim, according to the BBC. "Everyone is waiting to see who will win the war and who will lose."The Darfur region is home to vast deposits of natural gas and oil. It is also Africa's third-largest source of gold.Nigeria,	0
Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, look out. Your traditional video game console business model may be in danger. Popular video games like the "Grand Theft Auto" series may soon be available on a new system. It's too early  to say for certain that the new game will blow these current system owners away, but it seems increasingly likely that this system will soon be a major competitor to one or more of these three companies.In fact, that could happen any time now. The console market is becoming crowded. With the recent release of the Nintendo Wii, Sony's PlayStation 3, and Microsoft's Xbox 360, console sales have jumped by 37 percent in the last year to more than 9 million new units.The new Nintendo Wii system is currently available in two models: the Wii and the Wii-Printer. The Wii is a little bit cheaper than the Xbox 360, but doesn't include the feature that is sure to make it a success: motion-sensitive controls. The system uses analog joysticks, like the Xbox 360. And while the Wii doesn't have a built-in hard drive, it does contain an optical drive. If it turns out to be a great system, the Wii could potentially compete with the three other home entertainment consoles on the market.Now, let's compare the Wii (for now) to the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. We'll be looking at game titles like "Final Fantasy III: The After Years" and "Final Fantasy X-2." Also, we'll be looking at some software that has already been released, but not yet released on the current game consoles.The Wii is the most important video game console that's on the market today. It has a huge appeal to people who are new to gaming and people who already own video games but think they don't need them for their new system.The Wii is the only reason I own a video game system right now. (And if the Wii fails, I might give back my Wii.)If the Wii is like the Nintendo Wii-Printer, which came out only three weeks ago, when will the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 become available?The only way I can see the Wii (Wii-Printer) selling better than the Xbox 360 (GameCube) is if the Wii has motion-sensitive controls. The current Xbox 360 has no motion-sensitive controls. The current PS3 has motion-sensitive	0
On Monday, news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in Chibok, in the northeastern state of Borno -- a region at the center of Nigeria's five-year terrorist insurgency. The very next day, the Nigerian military  kidnapped and killed the deputy governor of that region, who was leading a rebel operation in the region.These are just two examples of the many ways in which Nigeria's political and military elites have used the security forces to maintain power and to consolidate control. They also have used the security forces to punish perceived opponents or dissenters -- such as the women and girls affected by Boko Haram's insurgency.These abuses of civilians by government paramilitary and security forces have intensified in the two years since Boko Haram began its attacks. According to a March 2011 Amnesty International Human Rights Watch report, the "Boko Haram insurgency has resulted in the deaths of almost 5,000 civilians, while displacing more than 20,000 and leaving about 2.8 million children in need of aid and assistance.""These killings often come as part of a wide-ranging military campaign aimed at capturing large swaths of territory held by the group's local allies, Boko Haram," the report continued. "Thousands have been killed in cross-border attacks carried out by the Nigerian and local militia. Civilians have also been caught in the crossfire as military and police personnel have been killed or injured by Boko Haram fighters."The abuses of civilians by the security forces, however, pale in comparison to the abuses of civilians by Nigeria's political or military elites. In a just-released report, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Weapons (COPUN) details how President Goodluck Jonathan, who seized power last year, has used the security forces to kill and torture innocent civilians.One of his predecessors, the late U.N.-backed President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, once boasted about the abuses his security forces had put "behind bars." Yar'Adua, who became the president in 1994 after the  military toppled his predecessor, Sani Abacha, also used Nigerian military personnel to hunt down and kill suspected terrorists, including a university professor.Goodluck, Yar'Adua's successor, is following in his predecessor's footsteps, and the UN report highlights the "growing body count" of civilian deaths attributed to the Nigerian military and security forces.

Sheriff's investigators Thursday asked prosecutors to charge Justin Bieber with felony vandalism in his alleged egging of a neighbor's home. "No decision will be made this week," Los Angeles County District Attorney spokesman Ricardo Santiago told CNN. Detectives presented their findings to a prosecutor who must decide whether Bieber, 19, will be charged with vandalism and if the charge is a misdemeanor or a felony, Santiago said. The neighbor accused Bieber of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9. Investigators pressed for a more serious felony charge because the attack allegedly caused an estimated $20,000 in damage. If it were to happen, a misdemeanor charge would be easier for the singer to deal with, since he would not have to personally appear in court. His lawyer could handle the case without his presence. A felony, which carries a more serious penalty, would require Bieber's attendance in court. How Chris Brown, Lindsay Lohan could help Bieber A dozen Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies raided Bieber's $6.5 million home in the exclusive Oaks community in Calabasas, California, last month, taking the security video system as evidence. Thursday's meeting at the Van Nuys courthouse was the second with prosecutors. The recommendation of a felony charge was confirmed by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson. At the first meeting last week, the detectives were asked to conduct more interviews to "tighten up" their case, Thompson said. Bieber also faces misdemeanor-level criminal charges in Miami Beach, Florida, and Toronto, Canada. Bieber, dad ignored pilot's demand to put pot away	1
The sudden death of Academy Award-winning actor and comedian Robin Williams has sent shock waves throughout the world. The 63-year-old was not only known for bringing laughter to so many throughout his career but for a strong work ethic and unshakeable sense of humor, even when he was terminally ill with stage 4 metastatic melanoma. On February 9th, the actor's family issued a statement saying "Over the past several months, we have been in constant contact with the Robin Williams family regarding Robin’s condition and his decision to end his life. We continue to be deeply saddened by the outcome. "We now must take a step back to assess our lives and assess what to do next. We want our privacy as much as anyone else. We are committed to doing everything we can to find lasting peace for Robin and his children, while also providing the support they need. We have been grateful to share our news with Robin’s family, friends and fans. We ask for privacy as we go through this process, and we ask that people respect our privacy as we work through this." Shortly after the death of Robin Williams, many celebrities took to their social networks to share their condolences and support the family. The following are some of those who took to Twitter to express their sympathy to the comedian's family. Alyssa Milano:@matthewjmills I think we all know the truth - Robin was not just a comic genius; he was also a true friend. He was a tremendous talent who never took himself too seriously.

Somalia's president on Wednesday declared three days of national mourning for the victims of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 70 people in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. According to the Health Ministry, 72 were killed Tuesday and 103 remained injured, 38 of those in serious condition. A majority of the victims were students and their parents who were registering for an education program at a government complex. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist movement that has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. President Sharif Ahmed visited the scene and some of the hospitals where the victims were, the government said in a statement. Some of the injured who cannot be treated in Somalia will be flown to other countries. "At this time, when the country is in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis, the terrorists could not have attacked the Somali people at a worse time," said Abdulkadir Hussein Mohamed, the country's minister of information. According to the government, Tuesday's bombing was the second Al-Shabaab attack in two years that specifically targeted students. In December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing more than 20 people. Al-Shabaab is a group in Somalia that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States government in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe that Al-Shabaab has been severely weakened by the African Union Mission in Somalia, targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al Qaeda.	1
Just over half the public says that it's bad for the country that the GOP controls the House of Representatives, according to a new national poll conducted after the end of the partial government shutdown. And the CNN/ORC  survey (pdf) finds that a majority of Americans favor a bipartisan agreement to end the shutdown.The CNN/ORC survey of 1,011 adults was conducted from November 24 to 27, while the government shut down. In addition to finding that a majority of Americans are opposed to shutting down the government over the shutdown, the survey found that the public is split over whether it's a good idea for a bill that would reopen government to include some funding for border security.About eight in ten Democrats (81%) and 78% of those who identify as more liberal favor an agreement where border security provisions are included in any agreement that would reopen the government, while 55% of Republicans, the same majority who say it would be bad if the government shut down over the border dispute, are in favor of a bill that doesn't include that funding in any agreement to reopen the government, the survey found.But among Democrats and liberals, there's a big difference in how they define what's a good or bad idea: The idea of including some increased border security provisions in any agreement that would reopen the government is the preferred choice by just 48% of those who say it's good for the country, compared with 71% who say it's bad for the country. For Republicans, the opposite is true: About three in four (76%) say it's bad for the country for a bill that doesn't include some enhanced security at the border, while a similarly large minority (42%) say it's good for the country.That's perhaps partly explained by partisanship. Among partisan voters, 55% back the idea of including border security funding in any agreement to reopen the government, compared with 26% who back the idea of having Democrats and Republicans work on both sides of the issue equally.The CNN/ORC poll also found that most voters (54%) say that they would personally find no reason to support a bill that includes border security funding, although a higher percentage (63%) say that they would support a bill that doesn't include border security provisions. But among Democratic and liberal voters, there's little difference on that question, saying 55% would find no reason to support a bill that includes border security funding and 44% would	0

One of the most cosmopolitan cities in Africa, Johannesburg is multicultural and multifaceted. Make the most of your time there with these tips. The Apartheid Museum is an often disturbing view of South Africa's troubled past. Apartheid Museum It's a disturbing experience, but a visit to Apartheid Museum is essential if you want to understand the city's troubled past. On arrival, visitors are randomly allocated a pass labeling them as white or non-white, referencing the apartheid pass laws that obliged black South Africans to carry identity passes at all times. Harrowing multimedia displays and news footage recreate the brutality of the apartheid era, while nooses hanging from the ceiling represent the political prisoners executed under the system. Less bleak are the tributes to those who fought against the injustice of that era, paving the way for equality and democracy in today's South Africa. The museum is open between 10 am and 5 pm (GMT +2) Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is R30 ($3.20). For more information visit http://www.apartheidmuseum.org/ Meaty treat The Carnivore is one of the city's more unusual restaurants. A few miles outside Jo' burg proper, on the Muldersdrift Estate, The Carnivore is designed to satisfy your primal meat cravings. As well as the usual chicken, lamb and beef dishes, this eatery offers an intriguing selection of big game dishes, including crocodile, giraffe and ostrich. There are veggie options available for those who aren't tempted by the thought of slow-roasted impala, but if you choose the vegetable lasagna you may never find out if crocodile really does take like chicken. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg » Day tripping Jo' burg is well positioned for some interesting day trips. Pretoria is just 50km away, but has a very different to feel to Johannesburg, offering more of an insight into Afrikaans history. The Voortrekker monument and museum, just outside the city, celebrate the pioneer spirit of the Boer and their "Great Trek" from the Cape to the country's interior. If African wildlife is more your scene, head to The Lion Park, a small nature reserve about 25km north of Johannesburg. It's not the full safari experience, but you will get to see lions, cheetahs, antelopes, zebra and impala, among other local fauna.	1
A cargo train derailed Tuesday and crashed into a passenger train near Moscow, killing several Â­several passengers, Russian media reported. Two people were killed in the crash while another was slightly injured.Russia media have attributed the accident to sabotage by Russian police officers who were deployed to quash protests against recent corruption in the country.The Russian Investigative Committee said a criminal case has been opened. It is unclear where the train was going.A spokesman for Moscow police said they were "looking into" the incident.Investigators will try to confirm the cause of the derailment and identify the alleged saboteurs.The accident brings Moscow to a crossroads as a global summit for nuclear disarmament, which begins Friday, also falls in the month of May.The Associated Press contributed to this report.April 7, 2008Vladimir Kara-Murza was standing on a platform next to the Moscow metro that could not be seen by anyone passing.As dawn broke in Russia on April 7, the 32-year-old student boarded a train in the city of Moscow bound for the capital's suburbs.

Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested  for offering kidneys at inflated prices. And in India, a woman from Mumbai who contracted HIV while on a business trip in South America was offered a kidney for a mere $10,000. All this because she refused a fake cure offered by a Chinese doctor. All because she was a woman."There are thousands of people who are not just going to go away and be okay," said Dr. Mark Hyman, a leading surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School who is involved in organ transplantation. "This is a moral issue."It is no longer "one step" to a "get rich quick" life that requires "no work, no effort," with the help of modern medicine and the promise of a few million dollars in compensation. It is now a "two-step" process: first you seek help by selling your organs, and then you get paid. No longer do you have the option to save your life and live the rest of your life without the burdens of disease.In the past, a liver could be bought for $2,000 in India; a kidney, $20,000; and in Pakistan, a live donor kidney can bring $40,000. Now, the price of an organ has shot up from $200 to $1 million."In the United States, there is a system in place for organ retrieval and transplantation, and it's very, very good," said Dr. Hyman. "The government has done a wonderful job in making sure that the organs that are needed for transplant can be obtained."But China is a "parallel market for transplants" and the kidneys and livers that are sold there are usually of poor quality, and sometimes the organs don't even work.For that reason, many in the United States are willing to pay three million dollars to get an adult liver, but most refuse to pay more than $800 to have a child's liver donated. There is even a movement in the United States to ban selling of organs in China.But how is it that in the United States, people are willing to pay three million dollars for a liver but refuse to pay 10 times	0
A Canadian pastor, who went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip in late January, is being held in the reclusive Communist state, his family said early Thursday. The family of Rev. Hyeon Soo Lim said they received notice from Canadian officials that Pyongyang has confirmed that the pastor is being held. "The Lim family and the church community is asking fellow Canadians and the international community to continue praying for his release and safe return home," a family spokeswoman said in a short emailed statement. Lim, 60, went to North Korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before, said Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for his church, based in Mississauga, Ontario. On January 30, Lim traveled to North Korea from China with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day. Lim was scheduled to return February 4 from what was described as a "routine" trip to Rajin, in northeastern North Korea, where his church supports a nursery, orphanage and nursing home, according to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. In 1986, Lim immigrated to Canada from South Korea with his wife and son. He speaks fluent Korean and leads a 3,000-member church. Pak, the church's spokeswoman, said she doesn't believe Lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing, which is prohibited in North Korea. "He knows the language, he knows the nature of the government, so we don't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained," she said. "We don't believe that's the way he would have behaved. He's very wise about that." Previously, North Korea has detained Westerners on religious grounds. Cases include American Kenneth Bae, who was detained for two years after North Korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae was released in November. Another American, Jeffrey Fowle, was arrested after leaving a Bible at a club in North Korea and released after five months in detention. Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a Christian activist, was released from North Korea in 2010 after a visit to Pyongyang by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. CNN's KJ Kwon contributed to this report from Seoul, South Korea, and Tina Burnside from Atlanta.	1
First there was a burst of gunfire. Then a series of blasts. Then, less than an hour later, cheers. After a day-long massive manhunt for one Boston Marathon bombing suspect that terrorized several cities and riveted a nation, the shouting and applause on the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts, was a welcome sign of victory. Police shouted, "Yay!" Neighbors clapped. Residents and reporters who had been anxiously waiting on a nearby corner saw a concrete sign of progress. Police began leaving the backyard of a Watertown home where suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev had been holed up in a boat. A law enforcement vehicle with tinted windows drove by the crowd. When someone asked whether they have the suspect in custody, a police officer said, "Yes" -- and the crowd of residents erupted in cheers again. Minutes later, a series of Twitter posts from the Boston Police Department trumpeted the news. "CAPTURED!!!" one post said. "The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody." In Watertown, it wasn't long before SWAT teams shouted over a loudspeaker: "Thank you, thank you! It was a pleasure! USA! USA!" The crowd joined in. Watertown resident Mary Sullivan was among those cheering. She was walking her young black Labrador, Lucy, when gunshots rang out in her neighborhood on Friday. She waited for word on the fate of the suspect at the corner of Franklin and Mount Auburn with dozens of other residents. "I'm glad it's over," she said. "The city and the people have gone through so much pain over these irrational decisions of these young men." Jubilant crowds celebrated beyond Watertown's borders. Residents, once holed up in houses and apartment buildings across the Boston area, poured out onto downtown streets. Music blared as revelers brandished American flags across the city. Near Boston's Northeastern University, students hugged each other, waved flags and chanted, "Let's go Boston!" and "USA, USA!" Myles Marcus, a student at Berklee College of Music, said he was happy to join the celebration. "We've all been watching the TV, the computer, the live updates since the beginning of this whole thing," he said. "I just feel relieved. I feel like I can go back to school now and know that I'm safe."	1
Low-income households in Egypt are being hit by soaring food prices, placing a major strain on many poor families in the country, who are struggling to put basic staples on the table. Inside a small Cairo apartment, Howeida Nageh is dicing a few tomatoes in her kitchen. Her three sons have arrived home from school and they are hungry. Yet, the only food available is these tomatoes and a piece of bread -- and this will be the boys' only meal for the day. "Things are too expensive," says Nageh, whose husband left her to raise her three boys alone. "I used to take two onions and cut them over two tomatoes, cook and eat them. Now the price of onions has increased -- instead of using two, three or four onions, I now just take one and choose the smallest one," adds Nageh, whose largest source of income is the $30 a month she receives from the government.

High prices of basic food items have been cited as one the reasons behind the 2011 upheaval that led to the ousting of long-time President Hosni Mubarak. The chant "bread, freedom and social justice" could be heard around Cairo's Tahrir Square, the epicenter for disgruntled Egyptians calling for change. And now, with the country's currency devaluing, many Egyptians are making their displeasure known when it comes to their daily food shopping. "People complain," says vegetable vendor Milad Zakher. "They complain because vegetables are expensive. There is no demand like before. Before the revolution there was demand and money -- we used to have money. They were buying and selling and we had income; the revolution made people with no money." Sky rocketing prices of fertilizers and seeds, coupled with an increasingly dysfunctional government, are creating a difficult situation for farmers, and this is reflected in food prices and availability. Economist Angus Blair, president of the Signet Institute, a Cairo-based political and economic think tank, says that drastic action needs to be taken quickly to address the situation.	1
Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high. They should break 39 billion tons this year. But there's also some good news, a new study published Tuesday said. The rate at which Â­global warmingÂ­ is melting Arctic ice is increasing, which could slow global warming, according to the journal Nature Geoscience.In the last six months, carbon dioxide emissions from new cars and trucks have been cut by 1.2 percent, to a record-breaking 2.4 billion tons, according to a new study from the University of Michigan's National Center for Atmospheric Research.The U.S. House of Representatives took a final vote on the American Clean Energy and Security Act during the first week of December. If it passes the Senate, and President Obama signs it into law, it would slash $1.6 trillion in federal spending over the next decade, but only if the American people want it.The president's budget, unveiled last month, proposes $4.6 billion in "energy efficiency" projects, including nearly $4 billion in clean energy investments. That's a drop in the bucket, compared to the $50.1 billion that the government already spends on energy each year ($30.1 billion on "energy efficiency") and the $4.2 billion that's being spent on "renewable energy" ($45.7 billion)The U.S. Department of Energy released a report on Wednesday concluding that, since the beginning of 2009, the U.S. has invested in 13,000 megawatts of renewable energy, enough to power more than 17 million homes. In the rest of the world, it found, renewable energy investment has increased by almost 60 percent, to 4,900 megawatts.The federal government is getting out of the way when it comes to clean power in Illinois, where a major new wind energy project is on hold for at least two more years. That's according to a report on Wednesday by the Chicago-based Illinois Center for Environmental Excellence, a non-partisan group that says it helps businesses and consumers get clean energy benefits from wind and solar projects.When a California lawmaker announced last November his support for $6.2 billion in new clean energy projects in the state, he predicted the money would create jobs and create a net-zero carbon emissions state in just three years. He said the money would be	0
A strong earthquake struck coastal Chile near the port city of Valparaiso late Monday, causing mudslides and some minor damage, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The 6.7-magnitude quake knocked out some power and phone lines in the region, authorities said. The temblor was felt in the capital city, Santiago, located 69 miles from the epicenter. A CNN en EspaÃ±ol anchor held onto his desk as the quake rattled the studio during a newscast in Huechurba, a suburb of the capital. "We could feel the ground shaking," said journalist Richard Madan. "It felt like we were standing on a subway track but multiply that by about 200." Madan, of CNN's Canadian affiliate CTV, is in Santiago as part of the traveling press for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit there. Both he and the Canadian delegation were okay, Madan said. No tsunami warning was issued, according to Chile's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service, and a preventive evacuation for the area has been lifted. A 72-year-old man died of a heart attack during the evacuation, according to regional Mayor Raul Celis. The same part of the country was hit with an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in February 2010, killing hundreds of people. Chile is on the so-called "Ring of Fire," an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report.	1
For years, Kurt Sutter has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for "The Shield" and then as the creator of FX's wildly popular "Sons of Anarchy," a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in California. Now he's branching out and focusing his lens on real-life criminal organizations. The Discovery Channel recently premiered "Kurt Sutter's Outlaw Empires," a six-part series that looks at the micro and macro reasons behind groups that have defined their existence outside the law. Episode one tackles famed Los Angeles gang the Crips, with subsequent shows exploring outlaw bikers, the Irish mob, the Italian mafia, the Nuestra Familia and the Aryan Brotherhood. "On 'Sons,' we exposed a lot of people to a new world," Sutter told CNN from Los Angeles. "It humanized what was a stereotype for a lot of people. Yes, our show is highly dramatic, and we take a lot of dramatic licenses. But the reality of it, and details of it are very true, very specific. For me, that's what I wanted to do with this series." The show sprang from a different concept Sutter was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view, the criminals and law enforcement. For the final act, the two sides would be brought together in the same room. "The pitch was to have a high-level crime and get the point of view of the criminal party involved and law enforcement and hear their retelling of the same events," he said. "People were intrigued by the concept, but ultimately it felt a little too old school. Discovery was interested in a variation, and they've wanted to do a high-end documentary series." "Outlaw Empires" explores case studies of a few people involved in the criminal organization, using their stories and knowledge to make larger connections to the context of the outlaw group. Sutter pops up from time to time in cutaways to offer insights into the story he's trying to tell. He's not interested in getting law enforcement officials, psychologists or other talking heads to weigh in on why these people are "bad." Success, for Sutter, is telling a story that doesn't pass judgment. The approach that Sutter and his team took wasn't the typical "let's pick a subject and tell their story" usually associated with documentary storytelling. For him, they started small and worked outward.	1
Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega can be extradited to his home country, a French appeals court said in an opinion issued Wednesday, according to a court spokeswoman. France ordered Noriega's extradition earlier this year, responding to a Panamanian government request for the former dictator's return to face charges that he had a political rival killed. The extradition was held up by court action, however. It was unclear when French Prime Minister Francois Fillon would sign the extradition order to set in motion Noriega's transfer. Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering. He also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. Panamanian officials want him to face justice there in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora, a doctor and political opponent of Noriega. Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package. U.S. federal courts ruled against him. When U.S. forces invaded the country, Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound, blaring music at all hours, a psychological ploy to rattle the general. He eventually surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly escorted to the United States for a civilian trial. Noriega's U.S. sentence, originally for 30 years, ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior. However, he remained in prison while the French extradition issue was decided.	1
Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns. Reports of excessive force prompted calls for restraint amid intensifying demonstrations. U.S. President Barack Obama voiced concern about what the U.S. Embassy in Yemen described as "a disturbing rise in the number and violence of attacks against Yemeni citizens gathering peacefully to express their views on the current political situation." "The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protestors," Obama said. "Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right of peaceful assembly." The embassy statement said "the attacks are contrary to the commitments that President Saleh has made to protect the right of Yemeni citizens to gather peacefully to express their views." The violence in Yemen and Libya on Friday stood in sharp contrast to images from Cairo's Tahrir Square, where Egyptians showed up en masse to celebrate the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak a week ago. Saleh's foes in Yemen are trying to score their own victory. After midday prayers concluded, they marched from the gates of Sanaa University to the streets, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators Friday. Some told Amnesty International that they had been surrounded by security forces, aided by "thugs" who fired shots at them and beat them. "We are very scared, particularly because there are children with us," a protester told the human rights monitoring group. "We've tried to get the children out of the area, but the security forces have not allowed us to do so." "After Mubarak, now it's Ali's turn," chanted the anti-government protesters. "The people want the fall of the regime." "I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power," said Khalid Amer, a student. Despite concessions from Saleh, a tide of anger is sweeping through Yemen's youths, who say they are simply fed up with the status quo. At least 30 anti-government demonstrators were injured, according to Abdul Naser Al-Dumaini, an anti-government protester at a demonstration in Sanaa. The day before, at least 20 people were injured in Sanaa. Opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid said police at the scene did not try to intervene.	1
Just four days after winning her fifth Wimbledon crown, Serena Williams overcame the effects of jet lag to successfully begin the defense of her Bank of the West Classic title in Stanford, California. The American made a smooth transition from the London grass courts -- which she will return to for the Olympics later this month -- and an eight-hour time difference as she beat college champion Nicole Gibbs 6-2 6-1 in the second round of the hard-court event. "I definitely felt a little sluggish today, but it was fine, and it was good to get that win," Williams told reporters after winning against the 19-year-old wildcard entrant to register her 25th victory in 26 matches. "It's really bright out there too -- I was so used to all the gloom in London and all the clouds "I'll feel better after having tomorrow off and more time to get adjusted. I'm still waking up at like two in the morning." Gibbs, who is also the NCAA doubles champion, idolized Williams as a child, even serving as a ballgirl for her at age 12. "When I played Monica Seles for the first time it was pretty cool. To think someone would still want to be like me is kind of awesome," the 30-year-old Williams said. Gibbs won her opening match against Thailand's world No. 174 Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, who did not make it through qualifying at Wimbledon, but found a much tougher challenge in 14-time grand slam champion Williams. "It was a great experience -- it was really good to match up against that level and see what's out there," said Gibbs, who was appearing in the main draw of a WTA Tour event for the first time. "She's such a hero in my mind and so built up in my mind, but I think I was definitely more in the match than I had anticipated being. After a few points I felt I could at least compete at that level." Williams was full of praise for her opponent too, adding, "I think she played really well -- she moves really well and she doesn't quit, and I think that's the best quality you can have as an athlete, and especially as a tennis player. "She could have easily given up and she didn't. She's a fighter. And she has a really good first serve. I think she really held her own today."	1
Qatar's government says it's investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working during a fire at an upscale Doha shopping mall that killed 19 people, most of them children in a nursery. The fatalities at the  Shifa Center in the western district of Masrafiah were confirmed by a spokesman for the police, who said they are investigating six deaths from "arson and fire" at three of the mall's four towers and a fifth tower that is damaged, according to the AP.The fire broke out late Saturday night in an arcade where young people gather. The police, which say they know of 17 victims, said early Sunday morning that they were focusing on the nursery, and that firefighters "successfully put out all of the remaining fires in the mall."A police spokesman told The Associated Press that the first fire broke out around 1 a.m. when a worker ignited firecrackers near a children's play area. He said the blaze grew into a ball of flames with "considerable volume" and spread to the second and third floors, and then to the fourth floors.About an hour later, an alarm went off, a fire alarm was activated and sprinklers were "in operation," the spokesman said.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe fire department and fire marshal's office could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday.According to Qatar's Ministry of Municipality, Works and Human Development, the Shifa Center is currently in a state of emergency. It is being run by the state as a residential and shopping mall. The mall has an annual operating budget of nearly $1 billion.Many of the victims were children, and police confirmed early Sunday that five of them were siblings taken from the nursery. It is not clear whether there were any children in the first floor or basement, which are also still affected by the blaze, the spokesman said.The Shifa Center, also known as the Qatar Mall, is a popular shopping destination boasting over 3.5 million square feet of retail and leisure space, and a variety of restaurants and entertainment options.Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane, reporting from Doha, said it was not known whether the mall was targeted for the latest fire. But she said it was "possible that terrorism" may be a motive."Certainly the timing is something that would raise questions in the mind of the authorities."	0
Jose Luis Zelaya shed tears of joy Friday morning. "It's just insane," the graduate student at Texas A&M University said. "I've been working on this for six years. It is just overwhelming." Zelaya was electrified by news that the Obama administration will stop deporting illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. Zelaya came to the United States illegally from Honduras at age 14 to find his mother, who was already in the country, he said. Without the change announced Friday, he couldn't get a job to help pay for school; Zelaya, 25, is pursuing a master's degree in education with hopes of earning a doctorate and teaching middle school. He also wouldn't be able to consider job offers that presented themselves afterward. The uncertainty over what loomed after graduation spooked him. "Now, maybe I will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me," he said. "There is no fear anymore." Immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides News of the change raced across the country, buoying the spirits of immigrants and immigrant advocates who have campaigned for such a change for more than 10 years. "I'm definitely speechless," said Pedro Ramirez, a recent graduate of Fresno State University who was student body president when he admitted that he was in the country illegally. "It gives us a chance to show the American people that we're not here to use your tax dollars; we're not here to take your jobs; we're here to contribute," he said. Not everyone viewed the change with such enthusiasm. "This is a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on Twitter. "This decision avoids dealing with Congress and the American people instead of fixing a broken immigration system once and for all." Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the decision would invite fraud and hurt unemployed Americans. "President Obama's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people," said Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Read Napolitano's memo here (PDF) Under the new directives, those who were brought into the country illegally before the age of 16 and are not criminals, among other requirements, are eligible to receive deferred action for two years, and will be eligible to apply for work authorization.	1
Spain is expelling the Libyan ambassador to Madrid and three other Libyan diplomats here, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. "The government of Spain has decided to put an exclusion order in full force against Libyan Ambassador to Spain and three other Libyan diplomats," it said.The government of Spain said that Libya is currently "at the centre" of a "severe diplomatic crisis" and that the government "will take all necessary measures to protect the interests of Spain and Spain's values."It said Spain "categorically rejects the presence in Spain of the Libyan diplomats of whom only the ambassador can be expelled." Spain's relationship with Libya "has been very close and good over the last four years, and has now reached a new level of cooperation and shared interests," the statement added.Libya's embassy in Madrid declined to comment. The Foreign Ministry said the expulsions were made without the ministers of foreign affairs and economy having taken any decisions regarding the matter. "The diplomatic crisis that has developed in recent weeks has been caused by the Libyan ambassador's attempts to use the situation for his own personal interests," the ministry said."The ambassador is simply trying to take advantage of the absence of the ministerial decision to advance his personal position in Spain," the ministry added. "He has not succeeded in doing so."The expulsion comes after Spain's foreign minister José Manuel García-Margallo offered Spain's total support to Libya's sovereignty and independence and requested the international community to take a "proportionate and prudent" position in order to "protect" both Libya and Spain.The foreign minister said that the "current situation in Libya poses an important challenge for the region and the world and for Europe in particular and must be seen to be handled in a balanced, responsible way."He added: "The Spanish government has a long and close relationship with the Libyan people. They are our compatriots. We have always had a special concern for the Libyan people, and we are committed to working with them in order to make sure that they are able to develop their development and peace."Our objective to combat terrorism in the region remains our most important objective, and we have worked carefully with our brotherly Libyan neighbour countries to address this issue... We have never sought to ignore the suffering of the Libyan people. This is a tragedy that requires global attention and solidarity."The minister said that EU countries have	0
Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar. Andrew Getty, 47, had "several health issues," Aguilar said, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. There is no criminal investigation underway, he said. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was, Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home. Getty's parents, Ann and Gordon Getty, released a statement confirming their son's death and asking for privacy. Where the Getty family fortune came from Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled for next week. In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition. "My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously." Andrew Getty had three brothers and three half-sisters. People we've lost in 2015 CNN's Doug Criss, Janet DiGiacomo, Mark Mooney, Mike Love, Julie In and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.	1
At least seven people are confirmed dead and 51 injured in a "horrific" traffic accident in southwest England, Somerset police said Saturday. The accident involved 34 utes and a bus, which also was carrying six passengers, police said.Four people in their 20s and an 18-year-old girl died in the crash. Another 20 passengers were injured, Somerset police said. Three people were in a critical condition, while the other 12 were in serious condition and being treated for injuries.On Friday night, another two people were pronounced dead.

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic began his quest for a fourth title at the Dubai Tennis Championships with a straight forward victory over fellow Serbian Victor Troicki. The 25-year-old won three consecutive titles in  Rome before finishing his career on a high following a 6-1, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 victory against the 22nd seed in the second round.The No.1 seed took advantage of the fifth-seeded Troicki's errors in the first set and he never looked back in the decider. Djokovic looked dangerous against Troicki on serve and when the Serb had a second serve to his advantage the Serb did not manage to convert a break from the World No. 1. Djokovic ended up taking the first set 6-2 and although he lost the first set the Serb did well in the second and when Troicki served for the match he could only convert a pair of unforced errors from the Serbian on his return. Djokovic was able to hold Troicki off for the victory on the sixth match point which was set up perfectly by an unforced error from Troicki.He was then able to win three straight service games when Troicki served for the match point but Djokovic's serve came at the wrong time and he did not manage to capitalize on this moment. Djokovic broke Troicki in the next game when the Serb double fault in the middle of the service game. Djokovic then won the next four games on serve giving Troicki little chance of converting a break point. Djokovic's first set point came at the end of regulation but he double faulted on his first attempt and the Serb broke again giving Djokovic the set. Djokovic took the second set 6-1 with his serve again firing well on the second attempt.Troicki's serve was again firing well on the second chance when he held serve to love in the final set and it was not until Djokovic took the third that Troicki had a chance to equal the score. Djokovic held serve to love in the third set but Troicki took the match in the fourth by serving first and winning the tie breaker on his second opportunity. The result was Djokovic's third title of the season and the 25-year-old is the first man in the Men's Tennis	0
The church where Colleen Ritzer's family worshiped was filled with mourners for the slain Massachusetts math teacher's funeral Monday. "You can see the effect she has had and how the community has trusted in her and in the faith that she puts in people," said her brother-in-law, William Eves.Liz Smith, who was in the funeral as Ritzer's friend and church secretary, said the community has been strengthened by the grief and the faith of so many of Ritzer's devoted students from the school she started. Ritzer had been teaching for 15 years in a small private school in the town called Hillside, but was dismissed when the school's board of directors voted to close the school for six weeks. That made clear that Ritzer hadn't been a teacher for them."This is the worst thing they could do," Smith said. "I can't imagine how she would be feeling."Smith and Ritzer had been friends since meeting at the Boston Conservatory, and Smith's husband is also a student at Hillside. Smith said Ritzer had grown up in a home filled with music, and was very interested in the music program while she was student at Hillside. Smith said it's a loss that could have been averted had things been fixed."The tragedy for her family and friends was at the time that we were not able to do everything that we had done," said Smith, who also works in the school. "I can't even imagine what it would be like to be a math teacher, or a professional in education, and to see your position go away."It was not only Ritzer's friends who mourned her loss. Many students in the school, while not mourning in the way that many teachers do, came out to speak up at the funeral because they wanted the school to reopen."The teachers, the parents, everyone in this school is mourning too," said Jami Lassiter, a former high school teacher in the school. "Especially the teachers, who are feeling like they have lost a friend."Lassiter said Ritzer had been a great teacher, adding that the school was lucky enough to have the support of so many members of the community.One of Ritzer's students, Emily Miller, said the school has been in touch "every day" with parents in the community.

Republicans now have the Senate Majority and control of Congress going into next year. This means there can be no excuses for why bipartisan solutions designed to help the American people cannot pass the Senate and land on the President Barack Obama's desk for his signature. But winning this election is not enough. Republicans must be prepared to not only keep the Senate in 2016, but also build a foundation that will preserve their majority for the next several cycles. Republicans will have to thread the needle between opposing the President and pushing forward their own agenda. Congressional Republicans must show they can truly govern and try to avoid excessive high profile fights that are only popular to the party's base. Republicans won because the President's policies were on the ballot and so were the many incumbents who supported them. The electoral atmosphere could not have been better for the GOP, as the White House mishandled many issues, such as the IRS scandal, the immigration crisis, the growing crisis with ISIS in the Middle East and the health scares over Ebola in the United States. It's an exciting moment for the GOP because it can showcase its policies. Toward the end of the Bush administration, we had lost our way and wandered into the wilderness and let the other side take control. For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas, because they will run the entire show on Capitol Hill. They can start the process of putting in place a smarter, leaner and transparent government that restores freedom, grows the economy and creates more jobs. Figuring out ways to unleash the American potential will be the solution to keeping a lasting Republican majority. Now is the time for party leaders, rank-and-file members of Congress and governors to come forward and present the best ideas our party has to offer. We have two steady hands at the helm with Speaker John Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. They do not overreact in times of intense legislative drama and are able to negotiate solid deals in order to move the ball forward without giving up their core conservative values. In addition, Republican lieutenants like House Majority Leader Kevi McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn are all loyal and very able leaders to help implement the party's agenda.	1
All indications are that sanctions against Iran are really starting to bite and this time it is coming from the oil ministry in Tehran, which for months has denied that oil production was suffering due to international pressure. In an interview with the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA), Gholam Reza Kateb a member of the national planning and budget committee in Parliament referenced a report from Iran's oil minister Rostam Qasemi. In that report, the minister suggested that oil revenues in the country plummeted 40 percent, while gas and gas products' export revenues fell by 45% compared to the same period last year.

Read more: Opinion: Time to defuse Iranian nuclear issue Back at the OPEC Seminar in June 2012, the minister told me that sanctions would not have any influence on plans to expand production and investment, shrugging off questions that suggested otherwise. This despite analysis to the contrary from the Paris based International Energy Agency and Vienna based OPEC of which Iran is a member. The IEA back in July suggested that Iraq surpassed Iran in production for the first time in over two decades and production in Iran dipped to 2.9 million barrels a day. OPEC in its October 2012 survey said it slipped to 2.72 million at the time Minister Qasemi said output remained at 4 million barrels. Minister Qasemi was recently quoted at a conference in Tehran that Iran needs to invest $400 billion over the next five years to maintain production targets and to play catch up after years of under investment.	1
More than 4,600 people dead. More than 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal. One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge ides in Nepal and India.(CNN) -- The government of Nepal suspended electricity to over a million people on Thursday afternoon after a series of earthquakes, with the largest one registering as a magnitude-7.8.The most powerful of the quakes, a 7.8 magnitude, hit a temple complex in southern Nepal, killing at least 7 people and injuring more than 1,000 more.In northern India, heavy rains had preceded the quake by a day, washing out roads, cutting communications, creating landslides and causing damage.Many are saying they now fear the worst even though the magnitude-7.8 quake on Thursday afternoon did not trigger a widespread tremor.The official death toll has risen to at least 876, according to the local Civil Defence force, as the death toll rose to more than 3,000 from the day before, and there were reports of injuries over a million after Wednesday's 4.4 magnitude quake.On Friday, after the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in 18 years, Nepal police said that there may have been a total of eight more victims who may have been buried under destroyed buildings.In some parts of Kathmandu, including the worst-hit areas of Barah and Rautahat villages -- destroyed or damaged by the Wednesday quake -- there have been no fatalities.As the death toll rose Friday, residents were told to leave Barah village alone, as the authorities feared the area could turn even more dangerous.A senior official said that many people had died because "nepalese forces were not able to enter this area for most of the day."Another official blamed the deaths of the first day on the landslides triggered by the first quake, but admitted that the second earthquake had been devastating in many locations.The second quake, a magnitude 5.2, was felt over a much longer period of time in many areas compared to the initial quake.Many villages in Kathmandu, like Barah village, survived the quake or were not badly affected."I am still alive and in my house. But our house is very badly damaged. We are sleeping. We are happy that no one is dead in our village.We	0
caused by a faulty electrical cable -- and believed it was a terror attack, the school said. Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said. "As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured," said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F. Mbithi in a statement. He called on the students, staff and public to remain calm. CNN's Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi and Ashley Fantz wrote this story in Atlanta.	1
Retirement hasn't been full of lazy days, rounds of golf and luxury vacations for Gary Terry. When this former telecommunications executive called it quits after a 32-year career, he took up an equally time-consuming  hobby: writing a blog that had been neglected. Here's what he's posted, with occasional insights from his now-grown daughter.Tuesday, January 30, 2016I'd been watching the Olympics, but I only stopped to check the clock after I knew my grandson was home from school.I went to the kitchen window and saw the little kid come walking out of the house in his white, hooded sweatshirt. He waved his arms and blew kisses, so I knew he was ok. He was headed to school. The clock said 8:58.I headed down to the gym, a place where I haven't been in five or six years. I was sitting on the elliptical and, after I'd hit the button on the timer, the machine said it was time to play. I grabbed my gym bag and headed out of the door.I thought that running five miles was a great workout. Actually, it was a great work-out. I was having a great day. I was happy, content and a little sleepy.I ran that 5 miles. I walked the remaining three.I'm at the point where my feet feel so weak that they don't want to carry me. I'm in my office and I'm going to the bathroom. I look in the mirror, put my hand on the wall.The walls are gone.My feet are there.I have one foot on the floor of the bathroom and the other is in the air. I look down and see my legs. They're as weak as those of a dying person.I get back from the bathroom and my feet are gone.When I walk through the hall of my office, my left foot doesn't work. They're gone and my life is no longer mine. My feet belong to somebody else.The little kid is gone. His world has been ripped away from him. It's been taken from him and his parents will never get their insurance or retirement account or Social Security money back.There's a reason, at least for me, to enjoy the present and to never look ahead or even think about what's to come	0
In a gleaming classroom at Chong Hua High School in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, students peer at onion slices under microscopes. Their biology teacher calls on Abdurrahman Mamat to explain what he sees.  This is the view of an expert.The students know Mamat's name. They know he is from a wealthy family, a graduate of the local technical university, fluent in English and Chinese. Yet their eyes do not waver when he approaches them.  Instead, Mamat looks at the students with a mixture of disappointment and anger. After a moment, he lowers his voice. It turns out he is upset because his class will not be given a turn to do the experiment he is showing them today."I know very well that we should be happy," Mamat says in Russian, his language of choice. "But my father wouldn't like it. He's always very demanding."A week later, the teachers of the second grade at Chong Hua have been given a task to change the lives of the students, and Mamat's father, too, has given the teachers permission to help students whose parents are struggling to find work. It is a rare and dangerous experiment in education that could eventually help more than a million young people.The program is one of the most ambitious and controversial attempts yet made to address the deep, long-term economic imbalances in China, and could change the country's fortunes by helping millions of rural children and their families find work.This experimental experiment, though, is a long way from the stage, and the teachers who are being helped to help students at Chong Hua have not yet been given a name. They are the Tungshan County teacher who will be called Mr Chen, and the teacher from Beijing who will become known as Mr Wang.In what they hope will be a landmark experiment, a team of Chinese and Russian teachers and doctors from Chong Hua and Tungshan will work with an estimated 1,000 children and their families, trying to change the lives of children and their families, with up to 10 of them being taught new vocational skills such as bricklaying.In the village of Yushu, China's western Liaoning province, the young teacher's first day in Chong Hua was a far cry from his graduation ceremony at Tungshan Technical University.The school in Yushu	0
In February 2009, Sam Bassett got called to Gov. Rick Perry's office. Bassett was then chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, an agency set up in 2005 to regulate state crime labs after a series of embarrassing  mistakes revealed flaws in the way those labs tested evidence.Bassett had grown up fascinated with crime and policing in Austin during the 1970s, when Austin had a high murder rate. As a law student, he went to the state capital for the first time in 1972 to study the crime scene.He asked one of Perry's top aides to call the governor's office and tell him that he was interested in being in the agency's new crime lab oversight committee.He wasn't an engineer, and he understood the dangers of crime labs for the families of murder victims and wrongful convictions. But he had an instinct for how things looked and sounded about these things, and he became the committee's first choice to investigate the safety of Texas crime labs.When Perry was elected governor in 2006, Bassett had seen how his predecessor, George W. Bush, had tried to change the culture of Texas crime labs, by reducing their budgets and firing senior staff as he shifted from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. As he saw it, Bush had made "a lot of bad choices" in his stewardship of crime labs.Bassett's work at the board of the Texas Forensic Science Commission started well. He made public his findings, which showed how crime labs sometimes made false mistakes, and found weaknesses in the way the crime labs tested evidence. He was also able to get a top Texas police official, Bob Hall, to commit to hiring and training a crime lab forensic expert.But Bassett didn't get the position as crime lab oversight committee chair, because Perry was already looking for a new leader to replace him. Hall was not only well-liked by other crime lab directors, he was considered an expert in police science, and a trusted voice in the state police. Hall declined the presidency, and asked Bassett to take the role.Today, he is a senior fellow at the University of Texas at Austin's Baker Institute, working with the institute's Forensic Science Education, Training and Public Policy division."He was very focused on a science, and the science that people understood. ... He was not the person who would ask, what is the science of this? What is	0
Michael Jackson was an international superstar, and many in the black community herald him for breaking down racial barriers in the music industry. Michael Jackson was one of the first black global superstars. "Michael Jackson iz a real artiste," said Quincy Miller, who worked with Jackson at MCA. "He changed the world. I don't know who he will be, but he'll always be Michael Jackson." The fact that Michael Jackson was a black artist and one of the most successful in the history of black music, made Jackson an important black man. Jackson's fame led to an increase in black viewership and exposure for artists like Tupac Shakur, Public Enemy, D'Angelo, N.W.A., and Run D.M.C. The same exposure may be what may have prompted the creation of an entire genre of music. In Jackson's wake, countless black musicians and rappers sought to create hits and albums like Jackson's, which became known simply as "The Jackson 5." This genre was known as "Motown" music. In a 2004 interview with the Washington Post, Motown music manager Brian Coleman talked about how much Jackson influenced the creation of Motown: "If he really came out and created it and did something with it, what we did was we took some of these songs, and then we got other people to come and do what Michael did, which was a group effort," he said. "The genius of Michael Jackson was that he let everybody have a hand in his song. So now when we do a song, we have everyone sing along to it." These producers and writers took Jackson's style and changed it to fit their own sensibilities. Over the course of history, Motown helped pave the way for other black artists to reach their full potential and become global superstars.Motown ProducersThe story of Motown's history is a tale of black success and black innovation. The music industry was dominated by white performers and producers and black performers were often relegated to supporting roles, playing instruments as background singers. Even though black artists like The Jackson 5 were important pioneers in rock and pop music, their musical style was not the same as other rock and pop artists at the time (R. Kelly, Prince, Madonna, and Michael Jackson included). Motown was a place where musical styles were free to develop and progress. This freedom of expression led to some of the most popular and influential black music of the 1960s and early 1970	0
Watch out Howard Stern, it looks like Steve Harvey is angling for the title of "King of All Media." Both outspoken men have much in common, including being unabashed divorcees, best-selling authors whose vernacular is often used by kids to refer to sex acts, and even making light of the most taboo subjects.But Stern isn't just the queen of television, Howard is the queen of radio. He has made a career of criticizing and, more often than not, shaming the world's worst actors, comedians, and singers. Since 1996, he's hosted a radio show that's not even the station's official title (the Howard Stern Show), and he now works as a senior correspondent for Showtime.com. The popular and controversial host has been with Howard Radio since its inception, and his show is considered one of the best-kept secrets in media—if not in all of radio. In this exclusive interview, he talks about his love of show business, his experiences in the "unfriendly world" of journalism, how his show has changed over the years, and whether the new reality TV show, The Steve Harvey Show, will be any different.It's a great interview. And there's a lot here. But there's also something in it that's a little disjointed. He starts out talking about radio, and then he talks about how he wants to talk about the rest of it later.In all honesty, this is a great interview. The audio quality of the interview makes it sound like it's being recorded directly into my e-mail box, so you've got to watch out for those "suckers" in the middle of your conversation. And the audio quality is really terrible, but it's a great conversation nonetheless.The audio quality of this interview is very good. If you listen to the audio, it looks like the recording ended about three or four minutes into the interview. And I think that's pretty typical.

A skydiver's historic free-fall from the stratosphere was called off Tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record-breaking attempt. Another attempt is not expected before Thursday due to weather conditions. Felix Baumgartner is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet (about 23 miles), more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit, helmet and parachute. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier in such a dive. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. Organizers initially delayed the balloon launch Tuesday morning because of gusting winds, then tried to make it happen a few hours later at the Roswell launch site. However, as Baumgartner waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude, another wind gust whipped the more than 500-foot-tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission. Art Thompson, the technical project director for the mission, said only one back-up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt. "There's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high," Thompson said. Asked how he felt about having to call off the attempt, Thompson replied: "Deflated. No pun intended." "For Felix, it's a lot of frustration," Thompson added. "A lot of anticipation getting to this point, and then feeling that he's going to have to wait -- it's a lot of anxiety on his part, I'm sure." 'Human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight Years of preparation and untold costs to the primary sponsor, Red Bull, led to Tuesday's scheduled attempt. When the launch occurs, Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon. Then he will climb out of the capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched "delta" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, then deploy a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to Earth.	1
They were 17-year-old high school students driving to a party at a gravel pit. Perhaps they took a wrong turn; perhaps there was foul play. For 42 years, authorities have had no idea how Cheryl Miller and Pamela Jackson disappeared. Now there may finally be answers. A car that appears to be theirs was spotted in a creek just half a mile from the girls' intended destination near Beresford, South Dakota, reported CNN affiliate KTIV-TV in Sioux City, Iowa. The license plate and hubcap match those of the car they were in when they vanished in 1971. Authorities in South Dakota said Tuesday that skeletal remains were recovered from the scene. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley and Union County Sheriff Dan Limoges also said the vehicle, discovered in an embankment in Brule Creek, was processed and other items that potentially are evidence were discovered. The timing is especially poignant. Jackson's father died last week at the age of 102. His funeral was Saturday. The car was found Monday. It's caked in mud, which must be peeled off layer by layer, KTIV reported. Dry weather had depleted the creek of enough water that it became easy to see the car, the station said. A fisherman spotted the 1960 Studebaker Lark, said CNN affiliate KSFY-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Removing the car from the creek could take days, KSFY said. "The case has been reopened multiple times over the decades, including in 2004, when the state's newly formed cold case unit searched a farm in rural Union County, two miles from the gravel pit," KSFY reported. Six years ago, state prison inmate David Lykken was charged in the case. But the charges were later dropped after a confession he gave turned out to be false, KSFY said. Last week, authorities found two cars, with human remains inside, at the bottom of an Oklahoma lake. Investigators said one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970. The other might be linked to the disappearance of a man in the 1960s.

The many league tables which rank MBA programs vary in their methodology, but mainly share a few assumptions, including that a prime mark of quality is a stream of graduates entering highly-paid jobs in financial services and consulting. The cuddlier side of business: More MBAs are taking in environmental factors. However, one MBA table, the latest version of which has just been released, factors in some entirely different considerations, namely how well the programs incorporate wider social and environmental issues into their teaching. Beyond Gray Pinstripes, the "alternative" MBA top 100, is produced every two years by the Aspen Institute Center for Business Education (CBE) in Colorado, drawn from studies of nearly 600 full-time MBA programs worldwide. These days, almost all business schools have "at least a beachhead" of environmental and social awareness, according to Rich Leimsider, director of the CBE, although the extent of this varies greatly. The issue is an important one, he says: "It matters what the senior executives of companies do, say and think. "If you can change business education to include an appreciation for the social and environmental context you wind up with leaders who are really good at creating value all around." Overall, however, the issue is being taken more and more seriously -- while in 2001, little more than a third of schools surveyed required students take a course examining the wider issues of business and society, in this year's survey it has risen to 63%. Perhaps unexpectedly, the research shows that such courses are not inevitably housed within a dedicated department of ethics or corporate social responsibility. In fact, such departments are only the fifth-most popular home for social or environmental courses, behind those of management, marketing, strategy and finance. Despite the differences, the Beyond Gray Pinstripes table is topped by a familiar big hitter -- Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, also in the number one slot for the last such survey in 2005. Stanford, which offers MBA students more than 30 elective courses on subjects such as ethics, social responsibility and the environment, says it views the leadership of an organization as "a noble and critical pursuit". This approach now includes a new joint MBA in the environment and resources, as well as a course in which business and engineering students join up to solve problems -- one project this year came up with the idea of cheap and easy-to-power LED lights for those without mains electricity.	1
Boko Haram insurgents killed 35 people in coordinated early morning raids on three villages in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, a military source and residents said, the latest deadly ills afflicting the world's most populous country.The raids by Boko Haram, which have left tens of thousands displaced and killed more than 1,000, were reported in the village of Mubi in Damboa, near the center of Borno state, as well as in the neighbouring village of Chibok in a neighbouring state of Borno, the military said."A joint operation by the Army and the Nigeria Police with air force and helicopters took part in the raids. Seven insurgents were killed and five others were injured in Mubi, while six insurgents were killed in the second raid on Chibok," said the military source, who asked not to be identified.A resident of Chibok said his family had been forced to flee in the early hours of Tuesday after their residence was hit by mortar shells."The mortar shelling hit our houses. All our houses were destroyed. Our livestock had been slaughtered," he told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. "Boko Haram kidnapped our children and all we can do is pray for their return."Another resident said the military had asked residents to stay in their localities, adding that children were fleeing by foot to Borno State, about two hours away across the border.Officials in Borno state, where Chibok and Mubi are located, would not confirm the presence of armed Boko Haram in the state's south or its possible role in the raids."We have no knowledge of them being there," said a spokesman for Borno state governor Salle Uba.A police source in the city of Damboa said the military's role in the operation would have to be examined."You can't say what it is or could be; it is a joint operation by Nigerian Air Force, Army and police," the source said.The attacks took place at least a week after the military announced a major offensive aimed at crushing the insurgency, but also indicated at least some elements of the group are remaining in the region to carry out raids and kidnap people.Boko Haram insurgents killed 35 people in coordinated early morning raids on three villages in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, a military source and residents said, the latest deadly ills aff	0
Patriots Day is the third Monday in April marking the anniversary of the first battles of the American Revolutionary War. It is also the date for the Boston Marathon every year. It is meant to be a joyful celebration for the city, but yesterday that all changed. Tragedy struck and lives were changed forever after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon. Instead of celebrating the city, a nation now mourns the loss of three and the injuries of more than 100. But true to the American spirit, there are people and organizations on the ground helping the victims, and you can join their efforts. One Fund Boston Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston's Mayor Tom Menino,along with the city, have established the 'One Fund Boston'. "At times like this we are one state, one city and once people," Governor Patrick said.

As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey is the top-ranking officer in the United States armed forces, the most powerful fighting machine the world has ever known. The Irish-American general married his high-school sweetheart, Deanie. They have three children, Chris, Megan and Caitlin. We even know the names of their sons- and daughter-in-law, as well as those of their grandchildren. I have no need to know these personal details, but it's a great comfort that the U.S. military feels it should make them freely available. It's part and parcel of the transparency and accountability that maintains trust in an open society. This trust is never absolute, and often betrayed. But there are peaceful mechanisms to question it, to tear it down and to restore it. Now consider China. As part of the triumvirate running the Central Military Commission up until his retirement in 2012, General Xu Caihou was of a comparable level of seniority to Dempsey. But all we know of him from official biographies is the dry details of his rise through the ranks. When he became the latest "tiger" caught in President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign last month, we were suddenly confronted with stories about his family's role in the sordid graft -- including a multimillion-dollar pre-paid debit card given to his daughter as a gift. She was arrested, along with her mother, according to media reports. Such high-profile cases are designed to lend credence to Xi's vow to root out corruption at all levels, taking down the tigers as well as the flies. His biggest scalp to date: former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. Officials are reported to have seized at least $14.5 billion from his family, friends and associates. But the cases also highlight a fundamental flaw in China's political system: the state-sponsored veil of secrecy that shrouds the links between power and wealth, links that typically begin with the family. These ties are a problem for societies everywhere. Forbes in August exposed how Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's president, built a $3 billion fortune on ties to her father. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan is embroiled in a corruption scandal involving his son.	1
The co-star of "27 Dresses" discusses his personal style. "I just feel dirty," says James Marsden. Not to be alarmed: There's nothing indecent going on here. James Marsden Image 1 of / 15 Caption CloseThere's not as great a deal of dirt on James Marsden  ("27 Dresses"). Yet he's the handsome star of several movies, and is now the face of women's fashion.At first, people wondered why a man with his looks would turn to clothes for expression. It made sense, though, after a fashion campaign featuring him in a series of ads showed off his fashion sense, which is surprisingly conservative and understated, but one that's appealing.There is a certain appeal to Marsden because he is attractive and clean enough - so that's good - but has the look of a man who is comfortable in his own skin."I've learned that I like being in control," Marsden, 37, says in an interview with The Chronicle. "It allows me to be creative but I don't have to worry about what a man thinks of my clothes. I have to worry about what women think of me."Marsden was born in Houston but grew up in San Antonio, and he says he's "into fashion from the time I was young. As a kid, I remember dressing up like Mary Tyler Moore. Then as an actor, I dressed up like an action star."Marsden was "a very creative kid" growing up. As an actor, he would go out with the other actors and create costumes."Back then, you didn't have designers," he says. "You made your own clothes. There was the only place to get out of school. I had to do it because I could not play in a team sport. Now it's easier for me to get clothes from the stores.""This is who I am. I'm not gonna change for anybody.""This is who I am. I'm not gonna change for anybody," he continues, his voice flat and his eyes hard. "I'm not going to dress up like a woman for a man. That's a fantasy. I'm just a guy who enjoys the outdoors and enjoying life."There will be no women's fashion show in New York in March, when Marsden will be starring in "27 Dresses,"	0
The growth of e-commerce in China has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years. This is largely due to the rapid growth of Internet users, improved online payments, increasing coverage and improving services. Such a trend will continue in the next five years with sales volume predicted to remain at 27% cost of goods sold. Among all the e-commerce business models, business-to-consumer e-commerce is outgrowing others due to its credibility, scale, and services variety and scope. By 2017, business-to-consumer e-commerce in China is predicted to double its share and reach 46% of the total online sale, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Yihaodian's fast growth illustrates this trend. In the five years since its launch in July 2008, Yihaodian has increased its selection from 3,000 stock-keeping units to over 2 million, fulfillment centers from one in Shanghai to 17 in seven cities, revenue from 4 million yuan to over 6 billion yuan, and employees from 40 people to over 9,000. Yihaodian, which started as an online supermarket by offering mostly fast-moving consumer products, now boasts categories ranging from consumer electronics, apparel, books to mom and baby products. China, in its current state, lends itself perfectly to e-commerce. The rising incomes of its massive population pave the foundation for a growing user base and this population's density and residential infrastructure allow for efficient logistics. And that's only the beginning. China's Internet user penetration is barely 43% compared to the United States, which is near 80%, and its online shopping penetration is less than 40% of its Internet user base, about half of the U.S. If these statistics reach the U.S. levels, e-commerce in China will triple its scale. 1. Characteristics of Chinese e-commerce China's e-commerce industry has many unique characteristics, some a result of its nascent state and some a result of China's intrinsic cultural behaviors. Yihaodian exemplifies several of these characteristics. Cash on delivery (COD) is still a popular means of payment due to lack of trust in both online payment systems and the e-commerce providers themselves. However, when people start to gain trust through trial purchases, they shift towards online payment. When we launched Yihaodian in 2008, we had more than 70% of orders paying COD, but now it is less than 20%.	1
The leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, was wounded in a suspected U.S. drone strike Thursday, intelligence and Taliban sources told CNN Friday. A Taliban spokesman denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt. The spokesman, Azam Tariq, said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck. He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda. Other Taliban and intelligence sources, however, said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike. The drone attack killed 10 people, with four missiles landing near a madrassa, or religious school, Pakistani intelligence and local officials said Thursday. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. Meanwhile Friday, another suspected drone strike killed five people in the village of Zarini, in North Waziristan, two intelligence sources said. No additional details were immediately available. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. The strike happened in the village of Pasal Kot. That's in North Waziristan, part of Pakistan's volatile tribal region that is the site of previous drone strikes and clashes between the Pakistani military and Islamic militants. It comes a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video the Pakistani Taliban released. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not from the same family. In the video, al-Balawi said, "We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud, may God have mercy on his soul," according to a CNN translation.	1
The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship. The loss didn't go over well with hundreds of mostly young Canuck fans, who took to the streets and set several overturned vehicles afire a few blocks from Rogers Arena where the game was played. Some fans stopped to pose in front of the flames. Others danced on top of another overturned vehicle. A dull cloud of gray smoke choked some areas of downtown. iReport: Fires, rioting and looting in Vancouver Aerial footage showed Vancouver police wading into the unruly crowd that continually taunted and threw things at the officers. Members of the crowd leaped over one street fire, and officers wrestled several fans to the ground. "We're unable to release anything formal at the moment but officers are busy dealing with a few core groups of people bent on committing criminal acts like mischief, vandalism, and fights," Vancouver Police Media Relations Officer Lindsey Houghton said in a statement. "We're working hard to get everyone home safe." Freelance Journalist Jorge Contreras told CNN that 1,000-2,000 people were on the streets in downtown Vancouver, and that six police vehicles had been set on fire. After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period. The Bruins blew open the game in the second, after rookie Brad Marchand sprung on a rebound off of Canuck goalie Roberto Luongo to put away his second goal of the match. "We knew the second goal was going to be huge," Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview. "It was nice to get that one, and we kept pushing forward after that." Marchand would finish the game with two goals and one assist. But the game was really decided by Thomas, who polished off his spectacular playoff performance with a Game Seven shutout to take the coveted Conn Smythe trophy. Tim Thomas -- whose unorthodox goalkeeping mystified the Canucks all night -- set the NHL record for most shots faced and most saves in playoff history. He also shattered Johnny Bower's 1960s record for most saves in a Stanley Cup final.	1
Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was charged Monday with murder and other counts in a hit-and-run in Compton, California, last week, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He is being held ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a $1 million bond.Knight is one of the most powerful white men in rap music. He founded Death Row Records, which is responsible for producing numerous hip-hop artists including Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem.Knight, who was born on Oct. 16, 1972, was known as "Suge" until he dropped the "S."Knight's real name was Marion Edward Ochoa, but he was given that nickname by his friend Michael "Mayhem" Jackson, who knew he could "bust open" a fight at a party. In 2004, Knight married La Toya Jackson, the daughter of the famous musician Michael Jackson, although he married Jackson's sister La Toya on Oct. 23, 1989.After a few albums, Knight was accused of having an affair with his wife and, according to TMZ, "he took her to the cleaners at least $20,000." The tabloid said Knight tried to get his wife out of the marriage by threatening to "go public," and that La Toya "filed for divorce in June 2009 on the grounds that 'he committed adultery with the (Jackson) family.' "The LA Weekly said Knight spent the early 1990s "running from police" when he was suspected of "several bank robberies and an alleged drug ring."According to TMZ, Knight was arrested in Los Angeles in 1993 on suspicion of driving under the influence but was never charged because he was acquitted on a reduced charge.In 2009, Knight was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving when he was pulled over by a California Highway Patrol officer.According to TMZ, Knight was charged with driving under the influence but pleaded no contest, and was given a misdemeanor ticket.He was previously arrested for driving without a license in Los Angeles in 1994, and was stopped again in California in 1999.Knight did not want his real name to be revealed, but he said: "I have no desire to hide. I have always maintained the interest of my children. I have one child	0
Amid increasing optimism that a deal could be within reach, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to Geneva to help in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Kerry will fly to Geneva on Friday "in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations" with Iran, two senior State Department officials said. European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton invited Kerry to the talks, the officials said. News of Kerry's travel plans came hours after Iran's foreign minister said that officials could reach an agreement by Friday evening. "I believe it is possible to reach an understanding or an agreement before we close these negotiations (Friday) evening," Iran's foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Javad Zarif, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Though he would not detail what such an agreement could include, he told the state-run Iranian News Agency, "We expect to make a breakthrough." U.S. President Barack Obama also said Thursday night that a deal could be reached. There is the "possibility of a phased agreement" with Iran on nuclear issues, Obama told NBC. The first step, if agreed upon, would require Iran to halt advances in its nuclear program in return for "very modest relief" from economic sanctions, he said. But the United States would still keep "core sanctions" in place, Obama said. "So that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they're backing out of the deal, they're not following through on it, or they're not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon," Obama told NBC, "we can crank that dial back up." The comments came after a day of meetings in Geneva between Iranian negotiators and technical teams from the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and non-nuclear-armed Germany -- a group referred to as the P5+1 or EU3+3. Uranium enrichment is the key issue on the table during the talks with Iran over the future of its controversial nuclear program. "We are at a very sensitive stage of negotiations, and it is best if these negotiations are done at the negotiating table rather than on live television," Zarif said. "But I can tell you that we are prepared to address some of the most immediate concerns that have been raised, and we expect reciprocally our concerns to be met by the P5+1."	1
Ukraine's President returned to work Monday after four days of sick leave as neighbor Russia called on protesters who have tried to curb his powers to stop their "threats and ultimatums." President Viktor Yanukovych, who went on sick leave last Thursday for "acute iritis," returned to his routine but faced calls to resign from key opposition parties.The Russian Foreign Ministry said Mr. Yanukovych's sick leave has caused "very serious consequences" for the country, saying it can no longer operate at full capacity. The official said his absence has caused the resignation of top Russian security officials.In an editorial, the weekly Ekho Moskvy newspaper said that an attempt to impose his agenda through a "coup d'etat" by the protesters had resulted in the ouster of the Russian ambassador. The paper said Moscow had taken the threat of such a development seriously."As in all cases where the people demonstrate against their rulers, the authorities are forced to protect their positions with force," the editorial said.The editor was referring to the violent clashes between police and the opposition supporters that followed an August 31 police raid on the opposition youth movement, which resulted in the arrest of more than 50 activists as the police searched offices and homes of the group.The Moscow-backed opposition has called for a mass rally Friday to condemn the police action and to demand that the authorities reinstate the protesters.In the U.S., U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said it believes the violence at the opposition meeting was an effort by the authorities to quash a peaceful demonstration and "reinforce the police."But Mr. Yanukovych, whose health is failing, defended the police action, saying the protesters who he said were breaking into government buildings to set them on fire had been arrested."They're going to be prosecuted. Who knows? What we do know is that what they did for four days is the complete opposite of what we were doing," Mr. Yanukovych said.In the U.S., a State Department spokesman said the U.S. position on Ukraine was unchanged."The United States will continue to press the Ukrainian government to address the concerns about the country's human right record, including its refusal to stop the repression of protesters and to release political prisoners," said Sean McCormack.Human rights groups say at least 543 people have died in Ukraine, and at least	0
It's been a rough week for Alec Baldwin. Not only did he give very emotional testimony against an accused stalker, but he also raised the ire of GLAAD after using an anti-gay slur he didn't realize was one. According to Baldwin's own words - "gay is a f---ing f---ing f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king... f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king f--king" - he has learned his lesson and now has vowed to stop using it.The good news is that Baldwin learned a lot and is determined to be a better and more mature man.The bad news is that this is really only a temporary setback. The fact that he used an anti-gay slur and that he raised the ire of GLAAD doesn't mean he will never use the word again, or that he will stop using it.Gay is a f**king f**king f**king f**king f**king f**king F**king f**king F**king F**king f**king F**king f**king F**king F**king f**king F**king f**king f**king f**king f**king.The most important thing to know about Baldwin's use of the word, is that he did this because he is a gay man, because he has "a problem for words that upset people." He has a problem for words that upset people because there are a lot of words that can be used to offend people. This is why people can yell "n-----" as loudly as they want to, and they know that it is safe because it's in the dictionary. But what if I told you that in the vast majority of cases, people who are angry are not really angry at all? They are just angry at other people who don't agree with them. But what if I told you that in 99 percent of cases, they are not really angry at all? They are not even upset with anyone. They are upset because the world doesn't agree with them either, so they feel the need to lash out at other people who have wronged them. What if I told you that in 99 percent of cases, these people are not even upset with anyone	0
With Manchester United continuing their top form from last season and aiming for what would be a remarkable clean sweep of trophies this year, it's only appropriate that we should take a look at some of the other trophies Manchester United could win this season.1. Premier LeagueThe Premier League is arguably the world's biggest and most prestigious club competition, with a league that is home to the biggest clubs in Europe, from Barcelona to Manchester City.The top two clubs in the Premier League each have nine of the top 22 players in the world, with Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Cristiano Ronaldo and Diego Costa all on the list.Away from the Premier League, the Champions League is the other major competition in Europe, and Manchester United could enter the competition as soon as next season.2. Europa League/EuroFA CupWhen discussing the Europa League and the Europa League, it's worth recalling that they are not the same competition. One is an international club competition, the other is a continental club competition.What they do have in common is the fact that Manchester United are two of the three clubs to have won trophies in both competitions - albeit the United FA Cup in 1872 and the UEFA Cup in 1976.Of course, since 2012, the Europa League and the Europa League have been competing with each other, and the current champions are Real Madrid, although Manchester United have yet to win the trophy. After their win against Chelsea, United could win the cup for the first time in eight years.3. European Super LeagueThis competition has been running since 1994, and has been won by four different teams: Ajax (1998), Porto (1996), Bayern Munich (1992) and Barcelona (1988).However, it's worth remembering that the competition has only ever been run as an individual competition, rather than a team competition, and this has led to a lot of controversy.The most controversial thing about the competition was the first edition's final, when Real Madrid was the only team to win it back-to-back with Porto. However, the original idea behind the competition was to award the competition to the European club that best captured the spirit of European football.4. League Cup/FA CupThe League Cup is a knockout competition that has been run at various times since 1872, and has been won by four different teams. They	0
Two U.S. marshals and a police officer were shot Tuesday while trying to serve an arrest warrant in St. Louis, authorities said. One of the marshals, John ____, had been hit in the arm and leg. The officer’s wound was not life-threatening, officials said. The other marshal, David J. ____, was shot in the chest. Another officer, a captain with the St. Louis police department, is in stable condition following the shooting. (AP)St. Louis police say the shooting death of two U.S. marshals at an apartment building in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., is being investigated as a criminal matter.Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said early Wednesday that he was “not aware” of any arrests or charges.The shootings took place early Tuesday, within about 40 minutes of each other. Police found two U.S. marshals, John ____ and David J. ____, in the doorway of a private apartment building in the 5100 block of Ferguson Avenue. The marshals were shot, Jackson said.Police arrived to several shots being fired, and they found two wounded agents, one with a blood-stained torso, Jackson said. There was no additional information about the second agent’s condition.Police have said the marshals were acting as a security force at the nearby St. Louis County police headquarters earlier in the day. Officers said they had no specific information about any threats against the county police station, which is only a block away.St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger said in a statement that the crime was being investigated as a matter of the highest priority.The St. Louis Post-Dispatch identified the marshals as David J. Jenkins and John Allen Jenkins. Both were white. The marshal who was shot was white, and the marshal who was hit by the bullet in his arm and leg was black.John Jenkins was born in Detroit, and David Jenkins was born in St. Louis, both of whom were enrolled at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Both graduated in 2004 with a bachelor’s degree in criminology.Both marshals had been working as reserve officers for the St. Louis County police, St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson said.“We are working through the investigation to	0
If that car parked in Harvard Yard is a rockin', school officials may soon come a knockin', because hanky-panky between students and faculty at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is no rumor.Dartmouth officials in the past year have been forced to discipline several faculty members for inappropriate relations with students. In at least two cases, the professors were warned about their future employment or transferred from their positions.The controversy erupted in late spring of 2002 after the freshman political science major, Lisa Hodge, accused then-Faculty Advisor Michael R. Smith of sexual harassment at a faculty meeting. Hodge said she had been in a relationship with Smith for three months, but began to get sick of his advances after his wife left him for new husband."He would tell me he loved me, but he was a player," Hodge told the Union Leader. "I would say, 'OK, but can I finish my paper, please?' One day he was like, 'OK, I love you, but I got to go be on TV.' And I said, 'OK, I understand, but can I keep this from my parents?' He said, 'Yes I know, but can I please do this later?' I said, 'Yes, I understand, but I was at work and I have to go.'"Hodge called her mother before she told her. Her mother, who had to attend a wedding, called police and reported Hodge's allegations to the university. Smith was investigated, disciplined and lost his position.But now Hodge accuses the dean of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences of a cover-up. According to the Union Leader, she says she and Smith had a sexual relationship and that Dean Michael J. Kitzmiller told the faculty and the student-employee committee investigating her claims that Smith was not guilty of sexual harassment, but only misbehaving in class. Smith was suspended by the University of Massachusetts Boston for a year after the incident."I don't know why he [Ms. Hodge] waited so long to come forward, but I do know that her reputation was so damaged that it took her almost a year to come back to the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth [now] Dartmouth College," said Kitzmiller. "Dartmouth has been an equal opportunity employer for a very long time now and I expect that Dartmouth leadership will continue to act	0

After two years of a virtual stalemate of progress in Washington, members of Congress are headed home for five weeks during August. The pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election. So who will have the better narrative? And will Americans listen? Voters are unhappy with everyone, which includes President Barack Obama, Democrats and Republicans. According to Real Clear Politics polling average, President Obama's approval rating stands at 41.6% while Congressional approval is in the tank at 12.3%. Partisan warfare is a clear culprit to these low ratings. During August, voters should be prepared to take plenty of Advil, because their headaches are about to get worse. Expect to hear Democrats complain loudly that Republicans are going to try to impeach Obama, that an attempt to sue the President is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the Supreme Court decision on contraceptives. Republicans will shout that Democrats are driving the impeachment story to fundraise off their liberal base, that the Senate is obstructing progress to protect their vulnerable members in red states from having to take tough votes and that suing Obama is necessary because he isn't doing his real job of working with Congress. The polarization merry-go-round in Washington can be very attractive for a member of Congress to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents. But, when Americans run into a TV show they don't like, they turn the channel. Voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them. Climate change isn't going to cut it for Democrats and abortion isn't going to work for Republicans. They simply don't connect to the average voter concerns. The issues that matter are front and center in everyday American life. Both sides are going to have to address the border crisis and their solutions to the problem. We are dealing with innocent children who are caught up in this mess. The news has saturated America and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country. People are concerned and frustrated that Washington has spent too much time finger-pointing at each other.	1
Singer Al Jarreau "became weak from the altitude" in the French Alps and was hospitalized Wednesday, forcing the jazz singer to cancel several shows in France, Germany and Azerbaijan over the next week, his publicist said. Jarreau was admitted to an intensive care unit after he arrived in the resort town of Barcelonette in the southern French Alps, the publicist said in a written statement. "He is now awake and his first question was to enquire about his wife, Susan, and his second question was to ask about his tour dates," the statement said. "He is always thinking about other people." His condition was stabilized, but the doctor advised Jarreau to take a few days off of his tour to recover, it said. In addition to missing the Barcelenette show, the illness forced cancellation of shows in Osnabruck and Braunschweig, Germany and Qabala, Azerbaijan. "Al deeply regrets having been forced to cancel these four concerts and thus disappointing his fans, but is looking forward to returning to perform in these cities some time in the future," the statement said. Jarreau could return to the concert stage next Thursday in Nuremberg, Germany, it said.	1
The president she once pointed a gun at has been dead for nearly three years, and her longtime idol and leader, Charles Manson, remains in prison. Lynnette "Squeaky" Fromme appears in court in  New York and admits to stabbing a police officer in the neck with a screwdriver and to killing a woman with an umbrella. She admits to shooting a man with her husband's .357 Magnum revolver. She and her partner steal a $100,000 Rolex watch and a $1 million diamond necklace. Lynnette confesses to an arson fire of an apartment building, and she and her partner collect more than $1 million in insurance money."I killed a guy because he didn't like who I was," she says.The day before he was to die, Charles Manson murdered Sharon Tate and the pregnant actress' pregnant sister, Patricia, in their Los Angeles home. Manson had a grudge against the family because Manson thought Manson was the reason his brother-in-law, O.J. Simpson, was murdered. He blamed Manson for the death of actress Sharon Tate and the death of Patricia. "If you don't like a kid, you just don't come round," Manson says, and he doesn't like kids. Manson tells the Los Angeles Times, "If they were lucky enough to survive, they would have to work hard to recover. I want to pay it forward. To do what I could do to help people make themselves stronger and more aware. I want my life to mean something. I want to be remembered for something. My legacy will be more important than me." "I did not tell the police any further details, and they were very reluctant to help my family," he said. "They would not believe a word I told them." Manson wrote his own account of the crime and said he wanted to be remembered not as a murderer, but as a revolutionary, an antiwar activist, an idealist who was "a beacon of light in a world moving away from freedom and democracy." "We could be the future," he said. "We could be like the Beatles." "I was never going to be afraid of what would happen to me anymore, or what could happen to me," he said. "I was going to become the leader of a new, free society and take responsibility for the life I have lived. I was no longer going to be the victim of the society I knew or the victim of	0
Japan's GDP fell 4 percent last quarter, the fastest pace on record, the government said on Wednesday. A homeless man pulls his cart filled with possessions and goods for recycling on March 18 in Osaka, Japan. The January-March quarter for Japan was 15.4 percent lower than the same time period last year, according to figures released by the Cabinet Office. Exports fell 26 percent on quarter, while imports were down 15 percent. The GDP slide in the world's second-largest economy is the greatest drop among the world's leading economies. By comparison, GDP in the United States fell 6.1 percent on an annual basis. This was the fourth straight quarter the Japanese economy contracted. Analysts say the drop reflects cuts in domestic spending with job cuts, factory closings and less capital spending as a result of spiraling sales abroad. The news punctuates a month of poor economic news out of Japan in recent weeks. Panasonic, one of the world's largest makers of electronic devices, announced it lost nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31. Hitachi lost $8 billion in the fiscal year, with consolidated revenues down 11 percent from last year, the largest loss ever recorded by a Japanese manufacturer. NEC Corporation lost $3 billion in the past fiscal year, down nearly 11.5 percent from last year. Meanwhile, Nissan lost $2.3 billion for the year.Sony Corp. announced net losses of $1 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, finishing a year in the red for the first time in 14 years.	1
A second government report on the Secret Service scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia found no fault with how the agency investigated the matter, according to a copy obtained Friday by CNN. The report by the Homeland Security Department inspector general's office was scheduled to be released next week. In its first report last September, the inspector general concluded that the incident in which Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel last spring caused no security threat before President Barack Obama arrived in the country for a summit. The new report coming out Tuesday said the Secret Service "responded expeditiously and thoroughly" to the incident. The agency immediately pulled 11 agents allegedly involved in the prostitution scandal from the security detail, put them on administrative leave and removed their security clearances. Report: DEA agent made prostitute arrangement for Secret Service agent "Investigative activities included interviewing 232 subjects and witnesses, sending four inspectors to Colombia, reviewing thousands of e-mail messages, and administering 14 polygraph examinations," the report said. It noted that Obama's security was not compromised and that the agency took subsequent steps intended to prevent similar problems on future trips. The report made no recommendations, which signaled the watchdog's satisfaction with how the incident was handled. A third report examining whether the culture of the Secret Service enabled or tolerated such behavior was expected in coming months. Secret Service scandal: Systemic problem or abberation? The incident that embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old agency and raised security concerns involved agents who were part of the advance team preparing for Obama's arrival for the Summit of the Americas last April. They hit the clubs of Cartagena for a night of drinking that ended with bringing women back to their hotel rooms. A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to exposure of what happened and the ensuing investigations. Nine agents eventually left or lost their jobs. U.S. soldiers reprimanded in scandal At a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in May, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan insisted the incident was an aberration. "This is not a cultural issue, this is not a systemic issue," Sullivan said, arguing that similar misconduct hadn't occurred on thousands of other overseas trips by Secret Service agents. "On this particular trip, we had individuals who made very bad decisions." In addition to the Secret Service agents, 12 military personnel also were cited for their role in the scandal in Cartagena.	1
East Africa's vibrant music scene has been steadily gaining exposure, and now entrepreneurs and investors are catching on. Two years after its launch, Mdundo, a Kenya-based online music distributor, has grown into a major provider of East African music with a 20,000 track strong library on its mobile web platform. Currently growing by over 200 songs each week, the company says some 6,000 artists have so far signed up to the service. Customers can download old and new tracks for free within a limit, or pay 300 Kenyan shillings (around $3) a month for unlimited access without adverts. Unsurprisingly, Mdundo accepts payment in the mobile currency M-Pesa or Safaricom airtime. Aside from providing a useful service for music-loving mobile users, Mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of East African artists. Lesser known singers, rappers and bands can reach a wider audience by signing up and uploading their tracks. They can also monitor downloads and get paid a share of the revenue from those downloads. "There are no central rights holders of music in Africa and it's therefore extremely hard to manage rights and offer a complete library to the consumers," says CEO and co-founder Martin Nielsen. "For that reason illegal sites normally have the biggest library because they don't clear any rights." Rapid growth Mdundo is funded by Google-backed 88mph, a seed fund and accelerator that focuses on investing in web and mobile startups that target the African markets. The business started as a conversation between founders Francis Amisi and Martin Nielsen, and investors 88mph. Four months later, the team had recruited 11 more members and created a beta version of Mdundo. After a month, in December 2012, the service officially launched in partnership with Airtel Kenya. In 2013, 1,000 East African artists signed up to the service and more than 1,000,000 Kenyan shillings (around $11,000) was paid to artists in royalties. The company places adverts in the music as another revenue stream, capitalizing on its reported reach of 20,000 active users per week. And now, with advertising clients including Microsoft, Samsung and Nokia, 6,000 artists signed up and 250,000 people having downloaded music, the startup has ambitious plans for the future.	1
Could search crews be just a few hundred feet from solving a mystery that has riveted millions for 76 years? That's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Ã¢ÂÂLittle BessieÃ¢ÂÂ.Award-winning reporter Dan Simon and researcher and journalist Mark Biddle are looking for the location of Bessie in the days before and after she vanished in March, 1928, in their quest to put the search for her on firm scientific footing. Their finding, by a team of eight scientists from nine different countries, suggests that at least part of the mystery could be unraveled fairly easily.The clues to finding Bessie's location in the days before she vanished involve a photograph of a woman on the outskirts of the Little Bighorn National Monument in South Dakota. The photograph has only one clue, the name Bessie. The team says it used mathematical calculations to come up with a location, a place where they could search in great detail. The evidence points very convincingly to the area in which Bessie's plane disappeared."It's about as close to a complete location of Bessie as we'll get," said the study's lead author, Dr. Christopher C. Mihalka of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, the leader of the international team. "The chances that we're wrong are probably less than a 1 in 50,000."But as exciting as that story sounds, it's not the only mystery being staked out by Dr. Mihalka, his colleagues and even the National Park Service experts who are trying to crack the mystery.Bessie was only a minor heroine in her day - in 1928, there were more than 200 women who had won the top prize in the women's air race on the Great Plains. But Bessie's disappearance from the skies was not a trivial incident. In a few of the more than 7,000 letters to the New York Times by reporters who followed Bessie around the country, a few reporters got close to her, and saw a glimpse of a real woman, who was at times very close to the edge of life and death, in a moment when she had a choice of going one way or the other.Bessie flew in the 1930s when she was only	0
Ebola, ISIS and Ferguson grabbed the headlines in 2014, but there is another huge story that should not be overlooked. Historians could look back on this year as the beginning of feminism's third wave. The year was momentous for feminism. For the first time,  there is a new generation of young women who have grown up in a world which is now ready to hear feminist ideas. This generation's feminism is founded on a desire to take control of their lives, to end sexism and inequality, and to fight the patriarchy. We can see that this generation seeks equality – they want the best for themselves and for their children, and they want to be treated with respect and dignity.The rise of feminism has been accompanied by another development – online activism.The explosion of new social media sites and technology in the past few years have made it easier for people to get involved in social activism. While social media still has a long way to go, we are seeing a significant number of young women and men expressing their opinions and getting involved through the internet. This is the wave of the future, but it's a wave that has its own challenges. A wave that is not going to grow by itself.Online activism has been getting a lot of attention recently, but we need to take a step back and really get beyond the headlines. If we're to succeed, there are some key steps we need to take.Firstly, we need to understand the power of the internet. The power of the internet is in its ability to connect people. The ability to reach millions of people is unprecedented, and the fact that it's happening at an unprecedented speed and has been made open to everyone in the past decade is incredible.But we still need to understand the power of the internet. The power of the internet is in its ability to connect people.For example, the power of online activism is based on:1. Connecting people.Think about the power of the internet, and that will help you understand how the power of the internet can be harnessed for social change.The power of the internet is in its ability to connect people. This means that people in different parts of the world who are using different social media sites for different purposes can connect and collaborate, and work together towards a common goal.It's also about being able to create groups and get people engaged: for example, you can	0
A Chicago man who planned to travel to Somalia to fight for a terrorist group pleaded guilty on Monday to terrorism-related charges. Shaker Masri, a 28-year old U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty to ian terrorism charges after his attorney argued against a trial.Masri initially pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges that stemmed from his alleged membership in Alqaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Courts, according to court documents. His trial was set to begin Monday, a week after he turned himself in.Masri pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens. According to court documents, he took part in the planning of a plot to kill U.S. military personnel and civilians and to kidnap U.S. citizens, including a retired U.S. Navy SEAL and a Catholic nun, in Somalia.The Department of Justice said it had been investigating Masri since 2015 when he was found to be a member of Alqaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Courts, a terrorist group in Somalia. Authorities alleged that Masri was part of an attack on a U.S. military base, which were ultimately unsuccessful.His attorney argued in court that a trial would be too difficult. Masri had a lawyer in the U.S. but declined to have him represent him in the trial.“Shaker’s motivation, and his desire, is to have a jury determine his guilt or innocence,” said defense attorney Christopher Dunn. “His defense is that he was part of a group, but that he alone was involved. This is the only motivation he has for this guilty plea.”Masri, who had been living in Chicago, was arrested in April in California. Authorities said they discovered that he had been communicating with an Alqaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Courts’ leader.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security had identified Masri as a member of the terror group in 2015. Masri allegedly pledged allegiance to the group in 2013 and joined the group in 2014 after meeting with the leader.He allegedly traveled to Pakistan with the other members in 2014 to learn about guerrilla warfare methods and fought alongside them against the U.S.–backed forces.In Pakistan and Somalia, he allegedly trained in various weapons, medicine and engineering skills to earn money to fund his travels by robbing banks and committing crimes	0
Teachers -- like me -- love "teachable moments," so here's a big one from Monday's sweeping Supreme Court decision on gun rights and the states, McDonald v. Chicago. In it, the court not only validated individual gun rights, but applied them to every state and locality in the country. Americans know they have rights. Even some of my students who confess to near-total ignorance of American politics know they have free speech, the right to peaceably assemble, and the right to have a lawyer, should they run afoul of the law. But what none of my students know -- and what most Americans also don't know -- is that we can lay claim to these and other sacred Bill of Rights freedoms because of a different constitutional amendment, a cluster of 20th-century court cases, and something called "incorporation." Early in America's history, court rulings established that the Constitution's Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government, not the states. So, for example, if local police tried to shutter a newspaper for publishing legitimate, if unpopular, news, the newspaper would have to turn to that state's constitution for protection or help, and not to the First Amendment's protection of a free press. And since every state constitution is different, the actual rights of citizens varied widely from state to state. Moreover, in the nation's first century, citizens rarely had direct dealings with a national government of limited size and reach. All this changed when the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution after the Civil War. Several decades later, the court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment's provision saying that states may not deprive persons of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law" could now be used to apply or "incorporate" key provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states. Note, however, that this process occurred selectively, provision by provision, and over seven decades. The first Bill of Rights protection to be applied to the states was in 1897, when the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property was not to be taken for public use "without just compensation" was incorporated. Following that, the court incorporated free speech in 1925, press freedom in 1931, free exercise of religion in 1934, and so on until 1969, when it applied the protection against double jeopardy (being tried for the same crime twice) to the states.	1
U.S soccer star Robbie Rogers has "come out" as gay on the day he retired from the game Friday. The former Columbus Crew winger represented America on 18 occasions, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. But Rogers, Â a three-time FIFA World Cup winner with the United States, is the first openly gay professional athlete in the world. Rogers, 34, said that he has "come out" in a YouTube video posted by a friend, saying that he remains "very much in love" with his girlfriend while his professional career is over. â??The best part of the process for me was coming outÂ â?? I was nervous and scared. I have to say, from my first day with my girlfriend, I knew I was in love with her. She is my life. My heartÂ â?¦ beats for her and I never imagined the next day in October we would be saying goodbye. I miss my job and my teammates.

Research In Motion is preparing to release its much-awaited response to the iPad, the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, a month behind schedule. Among other reasons, Adobe Flash is probably contributing to the delay. The PlayBook was supposed to be out the first quarter of 2011 but is now set to release April 19. Some publications speculated on Thursday that the PlayBook's late launch is related to touchscreen supply. The PlayBook also lacks a finished software development kit for making apps, and won't have native mail, messaging and contacts apps. Difficulty getting Flash to work properly on the PlayBook is probably another one of RIM's woes. Let's take a look at the evidence. First, other tablet makers have had trouble with Flash. Motorola's Xoom launched without it, despite the fact that Motorola highlighted Flash support as a key feature. Even though Flash Player 10.2 for Android is now available in the Android Market, the version meant for Android 3.0 Honeycomb (which the Xoom runs) is a prerelease version with significant limitations and lots of instability. Second, sluggish performance and battery drainage have been problems for Flash before, and they're the reason Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave for nixing Flash support on Apple's mobile products. The Samsung Galaxy Tab, which runs an earlier version of Android, is the only major tablet that currently supports a shipping version of the Adobe plugin. Finally, Wired.com's Erik Malinowski tried a PlayBook tablet at CES and reported that Flash performance proved to be a "choppy and (ironically) limiting experience." RIM officials at the time were tight-lipped about the tablet's expected battery life, saying only that it would be more than an hour. That was an early version of the tablet, but choppiness in one of its key features doesn't bode well. Without great Flash support, a PlayBook tablet would practically have nothing to do. Last year RIM drummed up Flash support for the upcoming PlayBook, saying that it was going to deliver the full internet experience. That would, in theory, give the PlayBook an edge over the iPad. "We're not trying to dumb down the internet for a small mobile device," says Mike Lazaridis, RIM's CEO, during the PlayBook demonstration. "What we're trying to do is bring up the performance and capability of the mobile device to the internet."	1
On most mornings, my better half wakes up around 5:30, throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work. About a half hour later, I wake up my 13-year-old son, go downstairs to the kitchen to make his breakfast and pack his lunch. Once he's out the door, I brew some coffee and get to work. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the "gay lifestyle" -- run for your heterosexual lives. I understand opponents of gay rights must highlight differences in order to maintain the "us against them" tension that's paramount to their arguments. But this notion that sexual orientation comes with a different and pre-ordained way of life -- as if we're all ordering the No. 3 at a drive thru -- only highlights how irrational groups such as Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and others like them are in this whole debate. Pro-marriage organizations try to stop two consenting adults from marrying. Pro-family groups try to stop stable couples wanting children from adopting unloved orphans. And somehow, me doing something like going to the grocery store threatens the very fabric of society, as Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern spewed. She says "the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation" and "homosexuality is more of a threat than terrorism."  I'm not sure what her idea of a gay lifestyle might be, but with a growing teenager, buying and cooking food dominates my day-to-day. I don't worship Barbra Streisand, I don't watch any TV show with the word "Housewives" in its title and I love fishing, beer and Madonna. But more important, I'm just a father trying to keep my son away from drugs, get him into college and have a little money left over for retirement. I'm no sociologist but I'm pretty sure those concerns are not exclusive to gay people. In one of the most pivotal scenes in the biopic "Milk," Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, gathers a group of community organizers and activists to come up with strategies to combat a 1978 ballot initiative that sought to ban LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) teachers and their supporters from working in public schools in California.  As the small crowd settles down, Milk quickly glances around the room and says ..	1
At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said. Five foreigners -- one British woman and four Libyans -- were killed. The number of wounded was not immediately clear, the spokesman said. The Libyan government immediately raised its toll from the attack, and said there were at least 30 wounded.It was later reported that five more Libyans were killed in the attack, raising the total to 10 for the attack in an attack that began when the attackers ran into the building and demanded money.The Corinthia Hotel has a history going back to 1887. It has now become known as one of the most expensive hotels in the world.The Libyan government, which has been fighting a brutal war against Islamist militants in the desert, has been on the front lines in the battle for Tripoli the past few months. It has yet to comment on the attack, but it ordered an investigation to determine exactly what happened, although it said that the hotel was an objective in the attack."This is a terrorist attack, and a deliberate one at that. They have killed many of the guests in the Corinthia Hotel and injured a lot more," said Mustafa Jibril, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, in an interview with CNN. Jibril said 10 of the dead victims were staff of the hotel.Jibril said that the hotel was targeted because it is a hotel with a long history and as such, not only contains important historical sites but also was a favorite place for foreign dignitaries.Security forces were mobilized in Tripoli to prevent a similar event from happening again."We have deployed security forces. They are standing by in case a new attack breaks out. We are using riot police to seal off the area," said Mustafa Gahbi, interior minister of Libya, in an interview with CNN. "This doesn't mean we are going to attack the hotel any time soon. We are protecting the guests and the families in the hotel.""The attack was an attack by a mob who were angry that the hotel was selling their own employees to the Libyan army in exchange for fuel. They were angry that the hotel had been given the nickname of 'The Citadel of the Desert' by President Obama," said CNN's Pamela Brown in a telephone interview	0
She ventured where few before her had dared, taking on a decades-long business monopoly and overcoming gender stereotypes to become a major player in her country's lucrative drinks industry. As chief executive of Keroche Breweries, Tabitha Karanja has paved the way for many other female entrepreneurs in Kenya, a country where women are traditionally scarce in the boardrooms, and even rarer in million-dollar startups. Against all odds, the 48-year-old entrepreneur has painstakingly turned the first Kenyan-owned brewery into a lucrative business. In the process, she had to succeed where others had tried and failed in the face of an entrenched monopoly: East African Breweries. "People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years," says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008. "People thought it was normal for us to have only one company in this country," she adds. "I was too determined and said 'no' -- I have traveled many other parts of the world and I saw there is no country that had only one brewery; people had many choices so I said that I have to go forward and let the people decide." Read this: ' Why women will change world' Karanja's journey in Kenya's drinks industry started in 1997, when she started a fortified wine business aimed at the lower end of the market. For the next 10 years she came up against big names in Kenya's wine industry, but in 2007, taxes imposed on alcohol manufacturing made it difficult to keep prices low. Karanja says the hikes made her product too expensive for her target customers, forcing her to stop producing fortified wine. But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product. "So there I thought again and said, 'what do we do for this same market?' And that is how we came up with ready-to-drink vodka. We make it ready-mixed to precision for moderate drinking," she says. "Since then the market has always been opening up and has been growing into this new drink." Read this: The secretary who became king	1
Charles Saatchi told a London newspaper Tuesday that he went to police voluntarily over an incident in which he grabbed his wife, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, by the throat to avoid it "hanging over all of us for months." The furor over the incident dominated the British press Tuesday, a day after Saatchi accepted a police warning related to the case. In a statement to The Evening Standard newspaper, for which he is a columnist, Saatchi said: "Although Nigella made no complaint I volunteered to go to Charing Cross station and take a police caution after a discussion with my lawyer because I thought it was better than the alternative of this hanging over all of us for months." Images of Saatchi, a multimillionaire art collector and former advertising magnate, with his hand around Lawson's throat were front-page news in national papers for a second day Tuesday, after they were first published Sunday. Opinion: The rich and famous are not immune to domestic abuse Saatchi, age 70, looked stony-faced as he left his home in central London earlier Tuesday and declined to respond to questions from waiting journalists. London's Metropolitan Police said a 70-year-old man "accepted a caution for assault" at a police station Monday afternoon but did not name Saatchi. "Officers from the community safety unit at Westminster were aware of the Sunday People article which published on Sunday 16th June and carried out an investigation," a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN. "This afternoon Monday 17th June, a 70-year-old man voluntarily attended a central London police station and accepted a caution for assault," the spokesman said. CNN contacted Saatchi's company for comment but has not received a response. According to a UK government website, a caution is issued for minor crimes. "Cautions are given to adults aged 18 or over for minor crimes -- eg writing graffiti on a bus shelter," the website says. "You have to admit an offence and agree to be cautioned. If you don't agree, you can be arrested and charged. "A caution is not a criminal conviction, but it could be used as evidence of bad character if you go to court for another crime." Sunday People, part of the stable of tabloids published by the Mirror Group, published the photos Sunday of Lawson and Saatchi at a restaurant. The tabloid's website includes the caption: "Nigella Lawson attacked in public by Charles Saatchi."	1
Barcelona announced an internal investigation Tuesday after reports in Spain claimed that the club had commissioned detective agencies to spy on a number of their star players. The Catalan giants confirmed on their official urs were investigating the matter, and a source confirmed to ESPN FC that, as of Tuesday, there is an internal inquiry.The two biggest names in the Catalan case involve Gerard Piqué and Philippe Coutinho, both starters for the Blaugrana, and they were both named in the Spanish newspaper El País."I have never had a conversation... in which I had told the agent of a player to tell him what to say and what not to say," Piqué told reporters in Barcelona after Monday's training session.El País said that the Barcelona chief of staff, Guus Hiddink, had allegedly asked agents to "help Pep" on a number of matters. They also said that agents of the midfielder had been instructed to look into his private life, and that their conversations had been monitored.Piqué, Coutinho and Luis Suárez are all under investigation. Suárez is suspected of having shared an alleged video with agents, but the Catalan club has denied the allegations. Piqué and Coutinho denied the allegations, which El País said were part of a broader plan to spy on football stars in the wake of the Barcelona-Chelsea rivalry and the fallout from the FIFA case involving Qatar.The Blaugrana insist there are "no connections" between the investigation and the match fixing scandal. "There is no need to do this," sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta told reporters. "We do not need to do this. The players, the managers and the staff are doing their job."Barcelona's statement on the investigation said that it had been opened after reports of a possible attempt to tamper with the evidence provided by the Spain investigators investigating the match fixing scandal involving Neymar. Barcelona said it had received information that agents of players might have been asked to help the former Barcelona and Spain midfielder pay up to €7.5m (£6.3m) for an operation to fake a transfer to Barcelona, which would have changed the outcome of the case.Barca stressed that they did not believe agents were involved and they do not believe the report was connected to their internal investigation."What we know for certain is that the players are being	0
Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal "cash for clunkers" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. "I'd have been foolish not to take it," said Andrew Sable, Ã?Â?Ace of HorsfieldÃ?Â? at the Horsfield Historical Society. "I had a great family tradition in Canada as a car guy. That would not have been the case here ... I have always been able to buy cars at almost any time of the day or evening."Andrew Sable has been saving money over the years and now he has paid off a house with a $20,000 interest-free payment he got when his new car went on the "cash for clunkers" program. "I still have that same interest in it and I still want it," said Andrew Sable.Andrew Sable was willing to jump at a new car on "cash for clunkers," despite having a few payments left on his 2000 Ford F-150. Now he has a car that he plans to keep for 15 years but still needs a few extra payments. "I can't get a deal at $3,000 and that's what I was asking for," said Andrew Sable, Ã?Â?Ace of HorsfieldÃ?Â? in the Horsfield Historical Society.The "cash for clunkers" program gave Andrew Sable a deal on a new car. He made the payments on time for five years and then borrowed $60,000 to buy the car. He now has 11 payments of $199 left on his $20,000 investment. "We were at a point where we had almost $50,000 saved and we needed the cash and it came through," said Andrew SableAndrew Sable was willing to hop from job to job to reduce his debt and he said the cash for clunkers program made it easier. A man with a history of moving in and out of places, Andrew Sable moved to Horsfield in 1998 and found an apartment and a job, just as a friend in the area downsized. He had a credit card before, but he used it to pay for gas and oil, instead of paying cash for those items.

More than 2,000 lives lost. A vast and unfolding humanitarian crisis. And the downing of a civilian airliner that shocked the world. It's hard to imagine -- but true -- that the raging conflict between Ukraine and Russia, or at least Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels, all started with a humble trade agreement. As tensions run high over a Russian aid convoy described by Western leaders as a provocative incursion, reports of direct Russian military activity inside Ukraine and Ukrainian fears of an outright invasion, it's time to look back on how we got here, and where things are headed: How it started While the roots of the crisis run quite deep, what's happening now began to unfold in earnest in the fall of 2013. That's when then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union that would have pulled the country, so recently a satellite of the Soviet Union, toward Europe in the latest twirl of a dance that has lasted centuries. Instead, Yanukovych jumped at Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to buy $15 billion in debt from his cash-strapped government and cut the price of vital natural gas to the country. Yanukovych's decision set off protests in Ukraine's more Europe-leaning west calling for the government's ouster. Security forces responded harshly, beating protesters and firing live ammunition into demonstrations, resulting in several deaths. As clashes spread, so did international anger over the situation. By late February, Yanukovych had fled to Russia, the government had fallen and a new pro-Europe government had formed to replace it. That, in turn, set off pro-Russian demonstrations in Crimea, a semi-autonomous Ukrainian republic and the location of a major Russian navy base. After thousands of Russian troops filtered into the territory -- purportedly at the invitation of Ukraine's self-exiled president -- Ukraine's regional parliament called a referendum on secession, and before you could say "borscht," Crimea was part of Russia. And it's here that things turned even uglier. Pro-Russian fighters occupied government buildings in the country's east, demanding a referendum on independence. Before long, rebel forces -- believed to be supported by Russia -- had taken control of major cities in Ukraine's east. Fighting broke out between the rebel groups and Ukraine's military, fighting that continues today.	1
Four human rights organizations are urging authorities in the United Arab Emirates to drop charges against five pro-democracy activists. Court proceedings against the five men wrapped up Monday and are scheduled to resume July 25. They face charges of public   property abuse, disrupting religious freedom, and participating in unlicensed protests.The five accused are: Abu Dhabi resident Abdulhafid Al-Malki, who was found guilty of public property abuse and participating in unlicensed protests in February and fined 4,500 dirham [$2,130.00]. The other four, all Emirati nationals, face charges in the trial: Emirati citizen Nasser Al-Khalidi, who was found guilty of public property abuse and disrupting religious freedom in April; Shaker Al-Qudsi, who was found guilty of public property abuse in June; UAE citizen Mohamed Al-Qudsi, who was found guilty of unlicensed protests in May; and UAE citizen Mohamed Al-Balee, who was found guilty of participating in unauthorized protests in April.The activists were arrested in the Emirate of Dubai earlier this month after hundreds of people marched from a pro-democracy protest in Jebel Ali Square to the headquarters of the United Arab Emirates’ Ministry of Media and Technology, where the arrests took place. The activist were protesting in support of the pro-democracy movement and calling on authorities to release jailed media workers arrested during the uprising that swept the country in 2011. Five media workers were convicted in July 2012 for their work in the uprising—all six were sentenced to five-year prison terms.The government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has long maintained that there are no restrictions on media freedom in the country. After a long campaign by many groups and individuals, including journalists, human rights activists, and journalists’ unions, this was proven to be wrong. In light of these convictions, we call on the authorities to drop any criminal charges against the five activists.Human Rights Watch and other organizations have long argued that the arrests are part of the UAE’s increasing crackdown on all forms of protest in the country. The arrests are part of a wider crackdown on civil, political and labor rights, which include the detention of journalists who have been critical of the government. All six journalists were held incommunicado, and their families were informed of their detention only the day before they were charged.The UAE’s pro	0
Dropping like flies. Yet another one of the names floated to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has removed themselves from consideration for the role. According to a source familiar with the campaign to replace Hagel, Sen. Ben Cardin (D.-Md.) has been working to recruit a potential replacement.A cardin press aide and a person with whom he has spoken said Cardin had been trying to recruit Hagel’s potential replacement for some time. But they agreed to withhold their names for now and not say more until it could no longer be kept a secret. A cardin aide said the decision was not “a sudden shock to the system.”But they said that, so far, cardin hasn’t been able to identify any candidate, and that none of these names are currently in the running for the position. A cardin aide and this person said they know of no one in current consideration for the post, either for the position, or to replace Hagel."I would not say it will be easy, but it can be done, we just have to be patient," the aide said.Cardin plans to introduce a replacement for Hagel "in the next few weeks," the aide said, and he is hopeful the new person will be able to step up with Hagel’s successor and begin to implement the policies Hagel has implemented since he was first nominated by President Barack Obama, in early 2011.Cardin had not been in discussions with Hagel’s potential successor, the aide said, but said that could change."I would not say it will be easy, but it can be done, we just have to be patient," the aide said.Hagel has been rumored to be on his way out ever since the President announced his decision to nominate him for the top Pentagon post. And if Cardin is successful he will be a first-term senator. He is expected to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee if he is confirmed (the position has been vacant since last year when its chairmanship was assumed by Sen. Bob Corker), a position he has held before and which he has held on-and-off over the course of his career.Cardin has been a leader in opposing the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

Negotiating teams from Sudan and South Sudan have agreed to end a dispute on oil payments to allow the resumption of southern oil exports through Sudan's territories, Sudan's state-run Ashorooq TV reported early Saturday, citing  sources from the talks between the southern government and NCP.Read moreThe source of the report said the southern leader, Ibrahim Gaid Salbi has in turn agreed to pay oil-to-money at a lower rate in return for the southern leader accepting that his government will respect the southern leader’s political rights.But it added that the southern leader has not agreed to pay oil on a cash basis, as stipulated by the peace deal.Sources from Khartoum also told Ashorooq that the southern leader is to pay for $200 million in oil purchases under the draft agreement with the northern forces.South Sudan is currently holding a referendum on independence from Khartoum on 11 December. The southern leader announced that the referendum will take place in the next two weeks.Read more at BBC“Today, we agreed in principle to resume oil sales to the international community after a temporary suspension,” Salbi said in a televised statement. “We agreed that the southern government will pay for oil only on a cash basis, and if there are any deficiencies, we will fix those with our partners in the north.”The southern leader added that despite the withdrawal of the southern leaders from the NCP, he will “not give up on the unity of the country.”Salbi also said both the northern and southern governments have agreed on a list of measures to be implemented “for development of southern Sudan, which is one of the priorities of our unity as a country.”“This is a new day for the south.

Rescue workers Tuesday recovered the body of a child from debris left by a landslide in China's vernacular province of Sichuan. Nearly a dozen people were buried.The eight-year-old boy's body was found in a cave where a massive slide occurred Monday, state media reported.Sichuan's provincial government said the boy was likely hit in the head as he tried to climb down a 100-meter (330-foot) section of rock face.Rescuers brought him, along with seven others, to hospital.The rescue operation began around 1 pm local time (1200ET) and took four hours, officials said.The official Xinhua news agency reported the boy died of suffocation."I felt that as they were digging, I saw their digging hands like scissors. I thought, 'It must be a child,'" said one woman who worked to help search the cave."They put rope through the hole, tied and went down with their hands and with the rope," said another woman.State media did not make clear whether the child was among those missing, in a cave or injured.The boy's mother was quoted in state media."When he became old enough, he made a hole to put his father in," she said. "He was very brave and clever."The woman's husband, who has not been identified, is in hospital with a broken leg, state media said.Xinhua said on its microblog the boy made it out alive.Local official Meng Feng said the slide buried 15 people."We have dug out 17 bodies, but we have to go to three or four other locations to find people after the digging was finished," he said.An official from Sichuan's environmental protection and public health department confirmed the boy's death.The disaster happened at around 1:30 p.m. local time (1600ET), said Meng.Images on Chinese social media showed huge, jagged, rocky cliffs and collapsed houses blocking roads.Xinhua said the landslide likely was triggered by a strong winter storm that blew off of a cliff Sunday.The landslide occurred during a rare winter cold wave, according to the government agency.Xinhua said the snow and wind also likely resulted in the collapse of a 30-	0
Editor's note: Bishop T.D. Jakes is founder and senior pastor of The Potter's House of Dallas, Texas, a multiracial, nondenominational church with more than 50 outreach ministries. Bishop T.D. Jakes says the church must  walk with God rather than walk with others. He wrote this story in 2009. After his story appeared, a reporter called Bishop Jakes to ask why it was not on his blog. "I don't have a blog," he said. "So, I'm not going to be adding that one. I'm sorry, but I'm going to shut it down."In the early eighties, I had a girlfriend who loved to dance. She was a beautiful woman with straight, jet black hair and big, blue eyes. She was very confident of herself. She always wore jeans, a button-down shirt, and cowboy boots. I thought she was very hot. She had a nice figure. She seemed to be in good health. I remember one night, we went out in the bedroom and she put on a dance CD from the eighties and we danced until the sunrise. I asked her to dance again. She said she wanted to sleep but I said, "No, let's just stay up, let's stay up." She agreed. We were both so bored that we were getting sleepy, so we decided to stay up. We talked for a while. We danced. Then we talked some more. We danced some more. Then I asked her if she wanted to have sex, and she said no. She was still a virgin but she was not going to say no. "Why not?" I asked.She said, "Because you're not my boyfriend and you're not my husband and you're not my husband's wife.""But," I said, "we're together and we have shared bedrooms and shared dreams. We have shared things together. We have been close and we have been close and we have been close. And we've been both together, you know, one person and one person, together, and all that together. And, I think, that's good enough for me."She said, "I don't know, I don't know," I said, "Why don't we just stay up?"

Lady Gaga may have to disappoint a lot of her "little monsters" in Indonesia after Jakarta police recommended that her sold-out June 3 show not be issued a permit because of security concerns. "Yes, it is for sure, the promoter will not get a permit to hold the concert," National Police spokesman Saud Usman Nasution said Tuesday. The concert promoter, Big Daddy Entertainment, declined to comment on the development. "Please wait for further official information from us," spokesman Alif Ramadoni said. There has been an outcry against Lady Gaga performing among Islamists and conservative Muslims, who say her revealing costumes and sensual dance moves are "haram," an Arabic term that means "forbidden by Islamic law." The chairman of the Islamic Defenders Front, Habib Rizieq, said his group could not guarantee what might happen, as far as security goes, if the concert were held. The pop star was given a thumbs-down in March by a "high-ranking member" of the country's highest Islamic authority, according to The Jakarta Globe. The report said that Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the overtly sexy and controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta. "[The concert is] intended to destroy the nation's morality," Ridwan told the Globe. Ridwan is concerned that the singer's revealing outfits and sexy dance moves will set a bad example for Muslim youths. Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March. Police said the promoter should not have started selling tickets before getting a permit. This isn't the first bit of controversy during the singer's "Born This Way" tour. Gaga also ran afoul of Christian groups in South Korea, prompting the government to ban kids under the age of 18 from attending her show. Ahead of the concert in late April, detractors called it "pornographic" and a promotion of homosexuality. Yoon Jung-hoon, a reverend who helped organize the "Civilians Network against the Lady Gaga Concert" movement, told the Chicago Tribune that his group collected 5,000 supporters on Facebook. He also advocated a boycott of the show's sponsor, Hyundai Card, in addition to Hyundai Motor Co., Korea's largest automaker.	1
A man who survived the April 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech says not enough is being done to keep guns out of the hands of people like the shooter even as a jury found the university failed to warn students earlier that a gunman was on campus. "As someone who lost a teacher and many friends as a result of the Virginia Tech massacre, I am gratified by the verdict," said Colin Goddard, who was shot four times during the rampage by Seung-Hui Cho. A jury Wednesday awarded $4 million to the families of Erin Peterson and Julia Pryde after finding the university should have notified the student body earlier after discovering two people had been found shot to death in a dormitory room on the morning of April 16. Cho went on to kill 30 more people at Norris Hall, home to the university's Engineering Science and Mechanics Department, after chaining the doors closed. He also wounded 17 people, including Goddard, before killing himself. Two years before the shooting rampage, a judge deemed Cho a danger to himself due to mental illness, which should have disqualified him from buying a handgun under federal law. "We have Congressional representatives and many state legislators who have failed since Virginia Tech to keep the mentally ill and other dangerous people from easy access to guns," Goddard said. In the aftermath of the shooting, Goddard went to work as a gun control advocate, calling for among other things stronger measures that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. "It's outrageous that in America people sell guns without background checks and with no questions asked." Cho's mental health status should have been noted in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a database of people disqualified from gun purchases. But, in Cho's case, his mental status never went in the system. The reason: The federal government relied on Virginia to provide the information, and Virginia law disqualifies someone from buying firearms only if he has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient treatment, but he was never committed. Cho bought one of the guns he used in the massacre online from an out-of-state dealer, picking it up after background checks were complete from a Blacksburg, Va., pawn shop. He bought his other pistol from a Roanoke gun dealer a month before the shooting.	1
When the winner of the women's singles at the U.S. Open picks up her check for $2.6 million -- buck for buck the same as the men's champion -- she might well reflect that, if not for Billie Jean King's pioneering efforts, those riches might not exist. Supreme champion on the court, battler for equality off it, King took on the male-dominated tennis establishment and won. She was the driving force behind the formation of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) in 1973, the same year she famously beat former men's grand slam champion Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of the Sexes" match in Houston. "Everybody should thank her and shake her hand," King's fellow tennis icon Chris Evert told CNN's Open Court. "She put money in our pockets and provided a living for hundreds and hundreds of female athletes. "Tennis is the frontrunner in all sports in equality, so she deserves all of the credit." 40th anniversary Forty years on, King, who turns 70 in November, has been celebrating the WTA's anniversary in a series of events which defined the role of women not just in sport, but in society itself. The fledgling Virginia Slims tennis circuit for women professionals had been established at the start of the 1970s, but the leading players like King and Australian Margaret Court -- the all-time leading grand slam singles winner -- were still paid a fraction of the prize money available to their male counterparts. The men had formed their own union -- the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in 1972 -- and King was convinced it needed to be replicated for women. Using her famous powers of persuasion, and with help from other key figures such as Dutchwoman Betty Stove, compatriots Rosie Casals and Nancy Ritchey and Britain's Ann Jones, a meeting was convened at the Gloucester Hotel in London, just before the Wimbledon championships. Within a few short hours, the articles of the association were signed and the WTA was born. Player power "We finally all came together as one voice and having the power of one -- you know just one group. It made such a difference," King told CNN. Martina Navratilova was then just starting out on her incredible career, and it was only later that she appreciated the significance of what had happened.	1
Manny Pacquiao is threatening Floyd Mayweather Jr. with legal action following a row over drugs testing which leaves their proposed super-bout next year in doubt. Pacquiao is refusing to agree to a demand by the Mayweather Â“Money” fight promoter which would be contested under the World Boxing Association (WBA) rules and regulations for the super-bracket where he would be stripped of his WBC and WBO titles and possibly face criminal charges for illegal drugs under the Boxing Act of 2004.Pacquiao made his position on the matter clear in remarks to newspaper in Mexico, ”We are talking to the World Boxing Association. They are the ones that will make the rules. The WBA is the one that will make the rules. Mayweather is fighting under the WBA rules but I am not fighting under the WBA rules. If we have a lot of drugs, then I’ll go to the Department of Justice so that I don’t have to fight under those rules.”Pacquiao’s remarks came following a major testy exchange between him and Mayweather who announced he was going to test the 29-year-old boxer for illegal substances. Pacquiao, a world champion and the reigning WBA welterweight champion said he will not give Mayweather Â“Money” a fight he wants under the WBA regulations.“A lot of things are going on in my life that can affect the rest of my career. I’m not a drug-free boxer. Floyd is testing me. He says I’m a clean boxer but I have to prove it. I’ll prove to them that I’m a clean fighter. Floyd will know that I’m a clean fighter but I do not want to fight under the WBA rules.”Mayweather has repeatedly refused to take an anti-drug test but on Tuesday night he appeared on the fight channel of Showtime promoting the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight on December 9. The announcement from Mayweather came in conjunction with a challenge to the WBA to allow him to fight under their super-bout rules.According to the WBA, the super-bout is allowed because they say it is safer and it enables the best fighters to take on the best fighters. The WBA rules are used in the US and Mexico, but	0
I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos. She was speaking from her hospital bed in Christchurch, New Zealand, after being rescued from the rubble of a five-story building that collapsed during Tuesday's 6.3-magnitude earthquake. Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight. In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die. "I'm very lucky, I'm very, very lucky," she said. She said she remembered vividly the moment the quake struck. She had taken over at the reception desk to allow a colleague to go for lunch, and she was logging onto a computer when the "rumbling" started. "It happened so quickly. I heard the rumble and then stuff was falling from the ceiling and I thought it was best to go under the desk rather than try to get out. There wasn't any time to think, but I am lucky I didn't go to the stairs. There wouldn't have been time. I don't know what might have happened. "A lot of concrete pieces fell on me and the desk sort of bent completely around. My arm was trapped under a huge piece of concrete. It was starting to swell and I couldn't feel my hand. I couldn't get my feet out, and there was a lot of broken glass and electrical wires so I couldn't move at all. I was stuck there in a little cubby hole," she said. It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive. She began to call close friends and family on her mobile phone. "I was more or less saying goodbye. I just wanted to tell people that I loved them and to say goodbye." She was unable to reach her Melbourne-based son, Robert, and she left a goodbye message on his voicemail. Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out. She was awakened by shaking, but she says she doesn't know whether it was an aftershock or the building further collapsing. Whatever it was, it changed her fortune.	1
The U.S. Coast Guard on  Thursday found an additional two bodies of crew members missing after a helicopter crash in Alabama's Mobile Bay. Rescuers have now found a total three bodies from the Tuesday crash, and have suspended the extensive search even though one other person was still missing, the Coast Guard said. "The decision to suspend the active search was terribly difficult," said Capt. Donald J. Rose, a Coast Guard commander.  "We saturated 95% of Mobile Bay for nearly two days with both aircraft and boats to thoroughly cover the search area. Now, we must shift our focus to continuing salvage and recovery operations. As we continue to recover wreckage, we will look for the missing crewman." The helicopter, an MH-65C, crashed Tuesday night while on a mission from the Aviation Training Center at Mobile Regional Airport, a statement from the Coast Guard said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, the Coast Guard said.	1
Two registered sex offenders are accused of raping and killing four women in Southern California while the men were wearing GPS ankle-bracelets, authorities say. "The GPS was in fact intact, attached to these suspects during the commissions of the crimes," Anaheim Police Chief Raul Quezada told reporters Monday. Steven Dean Gordon, 45, and Franc Cano, 27, were scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, but the hearing was postponed until May 19 at the request of a defense attorney, authorities said. The two men were arrested Friday night. Their ankle monitors and the women's cell phone records helped authorities link the cases to the suspects, police said. The body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, of Oklahoma, was found at an Anaheim recycling plant on March 14, Anaheim police said. The disappearances in Santa Ana of the three other women are being treated as homicides, although their bodies have not been found. Kianna Jackson, 20, was last reported seen on October 6; Josephine Vargas, 34, on October 24; and Martha Anaya, 28, on November 12. Both men had been convicted of sex crimes involving children: Gordon in 1992 and Cano in 2007. Each man had checked in with police every 30 days, as required, and authorities had no reason to watch them more closely, Anaheim Police Department spokesman Lt. Bob Dunn said. A state Department of Corrections official would not say what authorities may have known about the suspects' activity. "Due to the complexity of the investigation, we are not at liberty to speak on those, but, however, the questions are coming forth to headquarters in Sacramento and, as time permits or we're allowed to, they will respond to your questions," Charles Dangerfield told reporters. All the women are believed to have worked as prostitutes, police said. Sex offenders routinely released from California jails, records show CNN's Michael Martinez and Stella Chan contributed to this report.	1
Lance Armstrong's fall from grace has left one of the cyclist's former sponsors not only "sad" -- but also without one of its biggest marketing tools. Premier sports eyewear firm Oakley was one of several companies -- including Nike, Trek and Anheuser-Busch -- to end lucrative deals with the American when he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after refusing to answer charges of systematic drug use. Oakley said the 41-year-old had been a "symbol of possibility" when he signed up, having inspired millions when he returned to competition after recovering from testicular cancer and then won cycling's blue riband event from 1999-2005. He also raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity through his Livestrong foundation before a report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency this year left his legacy in tatters. British Armstrong effigy causes outrage "The Lance story is a sad one, with our emotional connection with that athlete," Oakley chief executive Colin Baden told CNN. "We have been very consistent in how we view cheating and we've always stuck with this over the 16 years I've been with the brand, so that if the governing body rules that an athlete has broken the rules, we can't be a sponsor. "I don't think we'll change any of our strategic views of who we want to promote the brand, but how that person behaves is critical to having a positive relationship." Many people who once backed Armstrong, following years of allegations about his potentially being a drug user, have now expressed their anger at his apparent duplicity but Baden said there was no point in recriminations. "For me personally, it's an emotional response. I've never found anger to lead to anything constructive in life -- it's just a disappointment," Baden said. "I can be angry, but it won't change the situation, so I'm just left with the grief of what was a great story." Baden said there had been no question of Oakley dropping Armstrong until he was officially stripped of his titles. "We've had athletes fall in the category before and still followed the same rule. Once the recognized governing body rules against them, we follow that governing body's recommendations," he said. "I feel like we're not responding to emotion, we're not responding to the story of the day -- we're following the law."	1
Two hostages freed by a Colombian rebel group reunited with their family members in the country's capital Friday. Speaking to reporters, one of the freed hostages called for renewed dialogue between the government and insurgents. "Humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding, which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty," politician Armando Acuna said shortly after he was released by the FARC leftist guerrilla group Friday. Marine Henry Lopez Martinez was also released Friday and met family members at an airport in the country's capital. "This is the most beautiful moment of the liberations, the loving reuniting of the families. For this, all the effort is worth it," former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who helped coordinate the humanitarian mission to free them, said in a Twitter post. Acuna and Lopez are among a group of five hostages that the FARC leftist guerrilla organization pledged to release in December. Red Cross rescuers also participated in Friday's mission. Helicopters bearing the organization's symbol flew into the jungle Wednesday to free the first of the group: a councilman from the town of San Jose de Guaviare. Two other hostages -- a police major and a military service member -- are expected to be released Sunday. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed dialogue between Colombia's government and the rebels. But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night. "We are not going to suspend the liberations, because I do not want to frustrate the excitement and hope of the families of these hostages that are going to be freed, but what I want to say is that this game, this double standard, is totally unacceptable," he said. The FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.	1
Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs threatened to hit Palm with patent litigation if the company did not stop poaching valuable employees, according to a newly unsealed court filing (hat tip to Reuters). The document surfaced as part of a lawsuit between former employees of companies like Apple, Google, and Intel over the companies' no-poaching agreements; US District Judge Lucy Koh denied parts of a request to keep some documents sealed, revealing Jobs' comments to Palm CEO Edward Colligan. According to the document, which was filed late Tuesday, both Apple and Palm hired one another's employees during Colligan's tenure between 2003 and 2009. Colligan claims Jobs called him in August of 2007 — roughly two months after the public launch of the iPhone — to propose "an agreement" wherein Palm and Apple would not hire employees away from each other. Colligan's statement notes that the agreement contained a pretty strong "or else" clause: "Mr. Jobs also suggested that if Palm did not agree to such an arrangement, Palm could face lawsuits alleging infringement of Apple's many patents." Steve Jobs' yacht impounded over pay dispute Colligan sent an e-mail response to Jobs expressing his concern over the discussion. "Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other's employees, regardless of the individual's desires, is not only wrong, it is likely illegal," Colligan wrote to Jobs on August 24, 2007. Colligan went on to point out that Palm recruits employees based on talent, not because Palm wants to hurt other companies. "Threatening Palm with a patent lawsuit in response to a decision by one employee to leave Apple is just out of line. A lawsuit would not serve either of our interests and will not stop employees from migrating between our companies. [...] We will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money." Jobs replied a few hours later with a much shorter message. "This is not satisfactory to Apple," Jobs wrote. "I'm sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies when you say: 'We will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money.'" Photo: Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in 'jOBS' Jobs ended his letter by suggesting Colligan "take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here."	1
Poetry, performance and prayer celebrated the voice of literary giant Maya Angelou at a memorial service held Saturday at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. "She taught us that we are each wonderfully  created and that God's magic can happen in a single life," said Wake Forest University President Rev. Ralph Bunche.Mayawati said her party had no role in the death of the two men. "We were not going to make any statement or give any comment," said BSP supremo Mayawati. She said she was "shocked" by the developments over the last few days. The BSP chief, however, expressed a hope that the two men would be alive. "It's our duty to inform the world that those murderers were not from the BSP," she said.The death sentence has been passed down for Gopal Singh Bajwa and his brother Rajesh Raj Bajwa, both of whom were charged with murder. It was announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Gopal Singh Bajwa was given 18 years for the murder of a senior BSP leader, Rajesh Raj Bajwa, who he killed out of jealousy when he had an affair with his wife after which he was jailed for three years. The couple's son was also killed in the incident.Anas Sarwar, a veteran Indian journalist and author, who wrote a book of his writings, died in Tuscany on Tuesday after suffering a stroke, India Today reported.

Nearly two decades after the killing of toddler James Bulger by two 10-year-old boys in a suburb of Liverpool, what remains one of Britain's most notorious child murders this week proved once again it has the power to shock and outrage. Seen ersatz as a series of crimes that grew more egregious each day, the killing of a young boy in a bath full of vomit, milk and excrement is the true story of a child so profoundly scarred but so rarely heard.According to the boys' mother, Samantha Mazzone, there was a pre-planned assault at a house on Thursday 8 September 1996. The boys, James Bulger and Robert Thompson, knocked on the door of the home of Ian Watkins, a friend of Samantha's. She said she answered the door to find the pair threatening him. Watkins said he had been sleeping with the children but insisted, as he had in the past, that he had not molested them. The boys became enraged and Bulger knocked him to the ground, smashing in his cheek.They then allegedly tried to run away, but were chased by Watkins, who tried to drive a car off the street with the two boys inside, but had to return to his house to get his car keys. The boys then jumped into the bath, which had a tap on the outside, and Watkins, believing they were washing them.Watkins' house was just two streets away and it was about midnight when the incident was reported to the police. The boys were charged with the murder of Watkins, but because they were both under the legal age, an eight-year-old boy, Bulger, was charged instead. The judge at the time of the trial considered it his duty to hand down a conviction for Bulger, as there was no other evidence against him.A week after Bulger's death, Samantha and her sons were interviewed by police and, while Samantha did not directly claim to have killed Watkins, she confessed to washing her 10-year-old son in the bath for "fear" he would tell their mother about the other children."When the police asked if I wanted to make any statements, I said to them 'If I don't have anything to say, then I don't have anything to say'," she told the court.A jury later found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to life in prison. She served 20 years of	0
Last week's rumor was the real deal: Google is rolling out a new Gmail inbox today which autosorts incoming messages so important stuff is easy to find and clutter stays out of the way. Wait: doesn't Gmail's iphone-friendly, mobile-first, inbox still sort messages into folders? Apparently not, but this latest Gmail feature might be a good thing, or it may just be something Google did to make our inboxes a little less confusing.Google's newest feature, which is rolling out today (a couple of days after Microsoft rolled out Yahoo's new inbox), is a new way to sort your inbox by the content of your messages. Google calls this feature "smart sorting." It's a nice idea, but what makes it really different from Gmail's old inbox is that it doesn't actually "do" anything in the way you might think. Smart sorting sorts by content; Gmail's new inbox simply filters the content and stores it in a single inbox. "Smart sorting" is a fancy way of saying: "OK, Gmail, we know you're awesome at sorting, and we're going to make it even easier, so we'll just copy some of your magic and make it do our dumbing up," as Google describes it.Gmail's Smart Sorting now automatically sorts your incoming messages into four pre-selected folders with only the most important content—not just the junk—stacked on top of the rest of your messages. The feature works like this: If you're in any of the four new folders (or, if you're in the old "junk," Gmail's current Inbox sorting) and you happen to have junk messages in any of those pre-selected places, the only option is to ignore the junk in that particular folder. There aren't any options to either move the junk into another folder or, as Gmail's old inbox, put the junk into the "incoming" inbox. By the way, you can still see the junk if you open your inbox's New Message window, which, if you haven't noticed, has been replaced by Gmail's Inbox window.As far as Google's current inbox design is concerned, the smart sorting is only useful with the new Inbox. In the old version of Inbox, any message you had in any of the pre-selected folders was immediately in your inbox. You could select any of the four new Inbox folders to view only the messages	0
The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired. Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, reacts to winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. "This has been my dream for so long; I've always wanted to win the bee," Kavya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, told CNN. "I was just really excited when I was able to go up and spell the last word." The eighth-grader won $40,000 in cash and prizes for nailing the final word, "Laodicean," which means lukewarm or indifferent, particularly in matters of politics or religion. This year's bee -- an event that has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to exposure on television and in movies -- started Tuesday in Washington with a record 293 spellers. Kavya endured 15 rounds. In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.  Watch the poised winner describe the thrill » As she spelled words such as "phoresy," "hydrargyrum" and "huisache," she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciation, origin and roots before ticking their spellings off for the judges. "I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me," she said Friday. Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling "Maecenas," meaning a generous patron of the arts. Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year. "It was such a big part of my life, and I love doing it," she said. However, she may someday have a new role in the competition. "If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her," she said.	1
Sonia Sotomayor, who rose from humble roots in a Bronx, New York, housing project to a high-powered legal career, was sworn in Saturday as the 111th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Sonia Sotomayor takes the judicial oath Saturday as her mother, Celina, holds the Bible. With friends and family looking on, the 55-year-old jurist took the judicial oath in the court's wood-paneled East Conference Room, pledging to "faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me." It was the first time such a ceremony was televised. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 62-word oath required of all federal judges. In a private ceremony just moments before, Sotomayor took a separate, constitutional oath across the hall. Both oaths are necessary for her to assume her new duties. As her mother, Celina, held a ceremonial Bible, Sotomayor beamed as she waved to relatives and guests when she entered the room for the public ceremony. Among those in the room was her brother, Juan Sotomayor.  Watch Sotomayor take the oath » Roberts made brief preliminary remarks, telling the audience of about 60 that after the swearing-in, Sotomayor can "begin her duties as an associate justice without delay." "Congratulations and welcome to the court," he said afterward. Sotomayor made no statements and did not answer questions. She hugged her mother and several people in the front row. The newest justice can begin moving into her chambers and preparing for the upcoming fall term. The other justices plan to return early from their three-month recess to hear a case September 9 on free speech and campaign finance laws. Sources close to Sotomayor say she has already begun reading up on the caseload, and will soon formally hire four law clerks. She also will have two secretaries and a messenger to assist her. Justice Anthony Kennedy was the only current Supreme Court member on hand for the swearing-in ceremony. David Souter, whom Sotomayor replaces on the bench, was not there. He has retired to New Hampshire. The Senate confirmed Sotomayor on Thursday in a 68-31 vote. President Obama, who did not attend the swearing-in, will welcome his first high court appointee to the White House for a reception Wednesday.  Watch Senate vote »	1
Hussein Shafei prepared Saturday for a journey back to a place of darkness in Libya. Soon, he plans to stand again in Cell 14, Block 2 at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. Only this time, the metal door will not slam in his face when the prison guards start shooting at him.Shafei will be there to celebrate his 27th birthday, on March 23. He was arrested on Feb. 24 in Tripoli, Libya.“It is the first birthday I have celebrated with freedom,” Shafei said. “I am a fighter for the revolution and I will continue fighting for people’s rights. I will not stop believing that Libya will be free.”The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which documented Shafei’s case over the last 12 months, said his release is only possible after international pressure.“He has spent almost eight months in Libyan jails, and international pressure will be necessary to free him,” said Phelim Kine, CPJ’s senior advocate.As Shafei waited Friday to board a plane to Tunis, Libya, to celebrate his 27th birthday, the prison in Tripoli where he was imprisoned reopened his case.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which was not allowed in, refused to answer questions Friday about Shafei’s case. But a spokesman said the ICRC is “an impartial, independent party to monitor the humanitarian situation in Libya.”Shafei’s lawyers said during his case in court they received the case file.On Friday, they learned for the first time that the prison guards used tear gas to try to force Shafei to take a walk off a 20-story building.Shafei, who is from the outskirts of the capital, will never leave Libya. He is being held at the Abu Salim prison, which holds more than 1,000 inmates awaiting trial or deportation to the mainland for crimes they have committed in Libya and around the world, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.The ICRC and the Libyan government say Shafei’s release is impossible if he is in custody. Last month, Libyan officials called for Shafei’s release for months.It was only after he went into	0
Two children orphaned by Ebola play in the empty corner of a Liberian orphanage. Their parents died last month, and none of the extended family is willing to claim them. They're too afraid. For every Ebola grave, there is roughly Â‰100 non-Ebola relatives who died alone because Ebola is not common in Liberia and for every family not grieving, there's another. The fear is that the disease will spread. Or they'll all die.In the months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola a global health emergency, I sat with my husband at a nearby hotel, and tried to figure out which of the Ebola myths were true and which were just so many lies that they could not be believed. Some were simply ridiculous.The one that hit me hardest: "Ebola can only be cured by an act of God."My husband and I had been staying at this hotel for about two weeks. We'd been talking about how we were sick with a disease, and about the fact that I hadn't seen my family members since 2012, and asked him if they knew he was coming to visit. He thought they wouldn't mind if he came to visit for a while, but he felt guilty not seeing them. He said when they knew he was coming, they were going to come out and meet him. He tried to explain the process of dying and showed us a video he'd watched of his uncle. He said he would explain the process to them."There's a lot of stigma in Africa about not saying if you're not going to heaven."As we waited, I thought about how the Ebola virus makes people feel. It isn't just the fear of death. For every Ebola death, there's about Â‰100 other relatives who are grieving that family member who has died. And the fear of the virus is the fear of the unknown. In Liberia, Ebola is rare, and for every family member that dies from Ebola, there are at least two other family members who also die.In the U.S., there's a very public debate among health professionals about when people should begin to take preventative steps to avoid getting sick. Some doctors and public health professionals are very nervous about sharing this type of information with the public; however, I'm not sure that there is any real reason to be scared. The most basic advice is that we all just	0
The world is seeing sobering signs of climate change's accelerating impacts, from longer, more intense droughts to stronger storms and rising seas. Yet in contrast to the slow pace of international negotiations to combat climate change, national legislation is advancing at a startling rate, a surprise to those who ascribe to the conventional wisdom that progress has waned. Remarkably, since 1997, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 countries covering around 88% of global greenhouse gases released by human activities. This surprising legislative momentum is happening across all continents. Encouragingly, this progress is being led by the big emerging and developing countries, such as China and Mexico, that together will represent 8 billion of the projected 9 billion people on Earth in 2050. These are the key findings of the 4th edition of the GLOBE Climate Legislation Study, released on Thursday 27 February, the only compendium of climate legislative action created by legislators from around the world, and the most comprehensive audit yet of the extent and breadth of the emerging legislative response to climate change. Our message is that we believe national legislation should be at the heart of a new international agreement to tackle climate change, and this study is proof it can be achieved in every country. While optimistic, we must also be honest. These laws are not yet enough to limit global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the level scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of climate change. Yet these actions are putting into place the legal frameworks necessary to measure, report, verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions -- the cause of man-made climate change. Part of the reason for this spectacular wave of progress is changing attitudes. Previously, the debate on climate change was framed by a narrative about sharing a global burden -- with governments naturally trying to minimize their share. Now, however, countries are seeing mitigating climate change -- through clean energy and energy efficiency solutions -- and strengthening resilience to its impacts, as being firmly in the national interest.	1
From "Gladiator" to "The Lion King", "Pirates of the Caribbean" to "The Simpsons," film composer Hans Zimmer's versatile and imaginative scores have added aural color, light and shade to the on-screen action. From the beginning of his career, Zimmer has explored his interest in sound and music in film scores. He has established himself as one of the leading composers of electronic scores, incorporating them seamlessly into his more traditional scores, such as James Horner's original soundtracks for "Die Another Day" and "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" (for which Zimmer won an Oscar), and most recently, his work on the "Star Trek" series.Zimmer has received numerous film, television and video game nominations. The British Film Institute awarded him the lifetime achievement award for his score to “Die Another Day,” as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Original Score for “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.” Zimmer composed the music for the blockbuster movies "Die Another Day", "Gladiator", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "The Lion King", and "Gods and Monsters," as well as three of the soundtracks for the film "The Incredibles", winning a Golden Globe in 1997. In recognition of his contributions to modern music, Zimmer was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Composed For Visual Media in 2009.In 2006, Zimmer won the Brit Awards for Best Original Song for "Be My Baby" from "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", and took the award for Best Original Song for "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" from "Gladiator". Zimmer won the Best Original Score for "Wander Over Yonder" from "The Incredibles" for which he composed the original music.Zimmer has written several film scores for films featuring his works, including "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (with contributions from Howard Shore and Howard Shore) and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets". His most recent film score is the 2010 remake of "Raiders of the Lost Ark", composed and conducted by Justin Hurwitz. In June 2008 Zimmer was honored with the American Music Award and received the Golden Reel Award in New York City, both for composing "The Lion King", starring Beyonce, Michael Jackson, and Sylvester Stallone.	0
Ebola has orphaned thousands of children in West Africa, and relatives are terrified of taking them in for fear of infection, the United Nations said. About 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone  have lost one or both parents to the disease, according to U.N. child agency, UNICEF. In addition to mourning the loss of caregivers in the three hardest-hit nations, the children feel abandoned and stigmatized. "Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family, but in some communities, the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties," said  Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. With Ebola infections skyrocketing in recent weeks, the agency fears the number of orphans could double this month. In the next  few months, about 2,500 survivors will get lessons on providing care to children quarantined in treatment centers. Ebola survivors are considered immune to the disease. "UNICEF is looking at traditional and new ways to help provide children with the physical and emotional healing they need," the agency said in a statement this week. More mental health workers In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need. In  neighboring Guinea, plans are under way to provide  psychological support  to 60,000 children and families affected by Ebola. Comforting a child is a 'potential death sentence' "Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence," Fontaine said. "The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care. We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources." The U.N. children's agency said  it has received only 25% of the $200 million it needs for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region. Affected nations are reporting grim numbers as the deadly virus takes its toll. 'Untold numbers of children are dying' In Sierra Leone,  about 765 new cases were reported last week, which is a rate of five every hour, according to Save the Children. The aid group said there are only 327 beds available for Ebola patients in the country.	1
The list of people missing in tornado-ravaged Joplin, Missouri, shrunk to eight on Wednesday, as officials told CNN that the bodies of two people previously on the list had been identified. Stanley Kirk and Maria Alvares Torres died in the storm, and their next-of-kin were notified, said Seth Bundy with the Department of Public Safety. News reports suggested that two other people listed as "unaccounted for" may have been declared dead as well.  Bundy said declarations are not made official until family members are informed. Authorities also announced that a woman who was not listed as missing has died as a result of the severe weather that struck May 22, Bundy said. Over the weekend, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll stood at 142.  Not all the names had been released.  It was not immediately clear whether the deaths announced Wednesday were included in the toll. The May 22 tornado flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began in 1950. "It's indescribable ... just devastating to see all the destruction of my school, my home," said Joplin High School sophomore Chanci McGowen, CNN affiliate KODE reported. "My whole neighborhood is gone, but everyone's OK." The station broadcast images of a memorial service at the school, where a sign out front just had the letters "op" from "Joplin."  Someone used what looked to be duct tape to add letters, creating the word "Hope." -CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.	1
McLaren may want a reunion with Fernando Alonso, but the Spaniard has no intention of leaving Ferrari. On a frantic Friday at the Singapore Grand Prix, McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh announced he wanted to bring Alonso back to Ferrari to replace the injured Felipe Massa. Whitmarsh's hope was to use the car's unique engine in the hope of bettering the McLaren car's performance. McLaren's official statement said: "Martin Whitmarsh is very keen to have Fernando Alonso rejoin the team for Formula One. We all hope that the team, as a whole, will work in all possible ways to enable him to race with us at this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix." On Sunday, McLaren team principal Eddie Jordan said Alonso is not leaving the team, suggesting it would have to do with the team's desire to have a high-profile driver. "You never know if you're going to have a driver like Fernando come in and take the whole package over," he told ESPN. "We'll find out tomorrow, we hope." He added: "I think what he is doing is doing precisely what he says he is going to do. But obviously we're having a chat with him. All we can do, we'd like to have Fernando back. "We're going to have a look at this. We're talking to [Ferrari technical chief] Mona Shukri, we're talking to Fernando and at the moment we're doing exactly what we said we'd do. I would say we're open to whatever opportunity comes around." Alonso added: "We have some good discussions and our intention is very good, we really want to be racing together again at some point. "So I feel good here, we have good discussions." When asked if he would consider a move to another team, he said: "That's a long-term thing, but there is a discussion with the team that we are very much open to it. "Right now we are focused only on our own business. "There is a lot of other teams that we already know and we know that we are going to have to fight."F1 - Singapore Grand Prix qualifying & race ReportQ1: "It's going to be extremely hot in Singapore because we have got really high air temperatures,"Jenson Button said.

Middle-distance runner Caster Semenya carried the South African flag last month in opening ceremonies for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. That was quite a change for the powerhouse runner, who three years ago was scrutinized for issues other than her athletic performance before being cleared to compete. Semenya gained attention in 2009 before the World Championships in Berlin -- not for her athletic prowess, but because some questioned the then-18-year-old's gender. Her masculine appearance had raised concerns and complaints to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for all international athletic competitions outside the Olympics. Before the World Championships began, the IAAF confirmed Semenya was being tested for gender verification. The concept of gender testing for athletes is not new.  Various methods have been used to assure that men do not compete as women, which would give them an unfair athletic advantage. While both men and women produce testosterone in their bodies, in men it produces more muscle, adding to athletic prowess.  Women use testosterone to produce estrogen, the female hormone. This year, the London Olympic Committee instituted a new testing policy that measures testosterone levels of female athletes, rather than DNA. The testing is performed only if questions are raised about a female athlete's performance, and must be requested by a chief medical officer of a national Olympic committee or a member of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission. While Semenya won the gold medal in the women's 800-meter in 2009, the win was overshadowed by the gender questions, and her competitors complained she should not have been allowed to compete. On September 11, 2009, Australia's Daily Telegraph reported information from "a source closely involved with the Semenya examinations IAAF testing,"  which revealed that she had both male and female sexual characteristics. Semenya had no womb or ovaries, according to the report, and had undescended testes, causing her to have triple the levels of testosterone of other female athletes. Indian athlete under pressure to prove her gender after accusations While the politically incorrect term for people who possess both male and female sexual characteristics is hermaphrodite, the proper term is  "intersex." The IAAF advised Semenya to get surgery because of the potential health issues caused by her condition. No public information was provided about her treatment. In July 2010, the IAAF cleared Semenya to compete. She took second place in her Olympic debut Wednesday in the 800-meter heats.	1
The president of Ukraine's top football club has warned six of its players who have gone AWOL they will "suffer" if they don't return to the conflict-torn country. Shakhtar Donetsk had played a friendly against Lyon Â in a game that the club's president, Andriy Shevchenko, lost - on Tuesday and four of the players have not come forward to sign their contracts."They will have to suffer," said the president in an interview to "A Sports Channel". "We have three teams that we were ready to sign for, we have a contract to sign. The situation is that we lost the contract to sign for the three teams. They have not come now. They have not come to sign their contracts, they've decided to leave. Maybe they will suffer. They will suffer, because we'll lose our team. I understand what they have to do."Shevchenko said the club's players were "not terrorists" and that they had been punished for their actions."We tried to hold the game, it was impossible. The Ukrainian people understand what we have to do," he said."For six months, a lot of our fans have been calling for our club's president to come to the stadium. It was all a misunderstanding. We lost the game for the fans because there was not enough time for the game to take place. We are all responsible for what has happened during the past few months. We have nothing to do with the players and we will give them the benefit of the doubt. As you can see, they still haven't signed their contracts. Our fans, they are always on our side. We will give them an opportunity."He also said he had done nothing wrong."We won the game against Lyon. They did nothing on purpose. It was a normal game. It does not concern anyone [else]. I have done nothing wrong. We have nothing to do with them. They play football and they have to play. They have nothing to do with us."Shevchenko was unable to attend the final whistle of the match for the fans to celebrate."We had a meeting with the supporters afterwards. They are on our side. They understand that things are difficult. They know what it implies. They know that it is not easy to play football in the current situation."Lyon have issued a statement in	0
At the end of six seasons, six beautiful seasons, it's like high school -- time to graduate and go to college," Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino told CNN as he and his cast mates bid farewell to their MTV hit  The Sorrentinos. "The most important part about life is the next chapter, the next stage, the next season. It's very sad to go, we've done so much."Sorrentino, 32, is leaving in less than a year after the end of his current contract. He had recently signed a new and much-improved one that will take his career to the next level, beginning with more stability and the ability to build on his success on MTV. So far, he's done that -- becoming a household name and a member of the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.His departure, which was announced on Monday, is one of many for the cast, who are departing in separate batches, in accordance with their new deals. The Sorrentinos have been together since the show started. Sorrentino's father, Michael, is the show's creator and also the creator of the original MTV show.Mike Sorrentino, a member of the Forbes Celebrity100 list, took his own life on Monday. Sorrentino was found dead at his home in Staten Island on Sunday night by his mother, Michele."Michele Sorrentino, along with our families and our friends, we had a great relationship. She's a strong woman and she's going to be okay," MTV said in a statement.The MTV show "The Sorrentinos" made Sorrentino a household name, but he was also seen as a model for the show. In an interesting aspect of the show, he played off his upbringing in a family of hard-drinking, hard-living, and hard-partying.CNN's Michael Sainato contributed to this report.CNN was not able to reach Sorrentino or his representatives to ask about the circumstances of his death.The cast of MTV's "The Sorrentinos" gathered in the gym at the Waverly Place complex on Monday morning for their final performance.One of the last things that Sorrentino heard from his mother was a voice mail she received last week."Hi, mom, this is Michelle calling, is Mike gonna be in soon or soon?"	0
In 2007 and 2008, the American economy suffered through its greatest crisis since the Great Depression. The Treasury Department estimates that from 2007 to 2009, the heart of the Great Recession, more than 8.8 million American jobs disappeared and more than $19 trillion in household wealth was lost. In response to the crisis, the federal government took steps to reform our financial system, most significantly, passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Signed into law by President Barack Obama four years ago Monday, this bill was designed to improve accountability and transparency in our financial system, ensuring we never again face a financial crisis of this magnitude. Regrettably, Dodd-Frank has done little to address the root causes of this crisis. Instead, by institutionalizing bailouts and undermining a competitive and fair marketplace, this law has joined Obamacare as another example of big government overreach that has ultimately done more harm than good for the American people. Wall Street reform law only half done At 849 pages, Dodd-Frank touches nearly every aspect of our financial system, from capital ratios of large financial institutions down to new rules on the credit cards most Americans have in their wallets. Dodd-Frank has only grown larger since Obama signed it. Much of the statutory text tasks Washington bureaucrats with writing nearly 400 rules. As of the first of this month, law firm Davis Polk reported 45% of rulemaking deadlines have been missed. Since its enactment, Dodd-Frank has imposed $21.8 billion in compliance costs while producing regulations that require nearly 60 million hours of paperwork with which to comply, according to estimates by the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. These compliance costs can be devastating to small community banks and credit unions. Often they are the only financial institutions serving small towns and rural areas such as those throughout my district in western North Carolina. Assuming these small institutions can withstand this Dodd-Frank-induced regulatory onslaught and stay in business, they will join larger banks in passing these added costs along to consumers, driving up the cost of borrowing and reducing access to much-needed credit.	1

John Jenal said it was unclear how a suspect got into a dark blue sedan and the shooting at around 6:45 a.m. was captured on video surveillance, but police suspect a woman was driving the sedan, Jenal said. Three children were in the car.The woman who is thought to have been driving the vehicle is described as a black woman with auburn hair, 30 to 35 years old, last seen wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and a dark blue jacket with the hood up, Jenal said.While the suspect opened fire at random, the woman was killed in the shooting.LAPD Chief Michel Moore said at a news conference late Friday night the shooter was believed to have been a man who had acted alone.LAPD Det.

A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the "least worst" choices to be the next pope, according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff. The three are Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines; Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria; and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, Ireland. Martin is not a cardinal, but SNAP noted that a man need not be a cardinal to be elected pope. Historically, the role has gone to cardinals, however. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, also a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, wrote last month that Schoenborn "certainly has the right pedigree for the job." And Tagle has "been a leader in pushing the church in Asia to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse," Allen said in a series he wrote on the papal contenders. Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said. Wednesday, SNAP named its "Dirty Dozen" list of men it judged would be the worst candidates for pope because of their handling of, or comments on, past allegations of child sex abuse against clergy. The scandal has shaken global confidence in the church in recent years. A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday indicates that U.S. Catholics see it as the biggest issue the Vatican faces. Asked what they think is the most important problem, 34% of the U.S. Catholics questioned mention sex abuse, pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal. No other problem garnered more than 10% of the responses. A report for Italian news magazine Panorama on Thursday claims that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago, in 1965 but buried the warnings. 'Absolutely key' Since Monday, the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious questions facing the church. The last of the cardinals summoned to choose the next pope, Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, arrived at the Vatican on Thursday. No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman.	1
A man suspected in the deaths of three people in Panama is now wanted in the slaying of an American woman whose body was found last week, Panama's national police said  Friday."The investigation is still open on the disappearance of the American woman and her body found at the time near the beach," police spokeswoman Maruis de la Rosa told reporters. "The investigation is still open""Three dead persons were found, an American citizen, her body was found at the time near the beach in the district, that's why police are looking for that person," she said.A man and an 11-year-old boy "have already been detained," she said.Authorities said they believe the man is linked to the killing of the American — who is described only as White, a 35-year-old lawyer living in a Panama City hotel who also has been to Costa Rica."It is necessary to say that the investigation is still open," de la Rosa said. Police have contacted the woman's family but have not made contact with them since her disappearance, she said.The body of the American was found in the Pacific ocean on Thursday morning, hours after she was reported missing, Panama's civil protection agency said. The civil protection agency asked all citizens to stay in their homes Thursday night as it began a search for the body.The agency, which patrols the streets of Panama, has been criticized for failing to take action to protect Panamanians from crime in the absence of an effective police force.Investigators said the body was not a victim of a robbery and that it was unlikely the murder was a kidnapping."The investigation will go on for several more days as the investigation in this case is very complicated," de la Rosa said.The body is believed to be that of a woman, but police have not given out any details.Panama's civil protection agency has been criticized for failing to do enough to protect its citizens from crime in the absence of a strong police force.There are no police in Punta Pacifica, a city of about 6,200 people that is home to one of Panama's largest and most prominent slums.According to the police, the body has been transferred from the area's morgue to a police station for DNA testing and will be sent off for autopsy.The man is known to authorities in the area	0
The Syrian conflict has become "increasingly militarized" as killings and torture by regime security forces and anti-government fighters raged this spring, a United Nations panel reported Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.N. secretary-general said there is no fallback plan to deploying monitors to some of the Middle Eastern nation's most embattled cities. U.N. monitors on the ground in five Syrian cities are making "all possible efforts to stop violence" and have had "some dampening effect," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. But he conceded, "We were not able to completely cease the violence." In an interview on "Amanpour," Ban said the full cadre of observers -- 300 -- authorized by the Security Council last month would be on site in the coming days. "They are patrolling every day, whenever possible," he said. "They try their best to cease this violence. It requires strong political will at the level of President Assad, and also it requires full cooperation by the opposition forces." The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria noted the growing power of forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. "Whereas government forces had previously been responding primarily to demonstrations, they now face armed and well-organized fighters -- bolstered by defectors who joined them." "Gross violations continue unabated," the commission's report said, adding regime forces commit most of the "serious human rights violations." The documented abuses "reflect this shifting context" amid widespread fears that the popular uprising against the regime of al-Assad, spurred by a tough crackdown against peaceful protests, is spiraling toward all-out civil war. Violence has raged daily. At least 40 civilians were killed across the country Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said, among them "a complete family ... martyred in the shelling" of a neighborhood in Hama. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, reported 43 people killed. Its toll includes 35 civilians mostly in the provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, as well as eight government forces dead in clashes with defectors in Damascus, Deir Ezzor, Homs and Idlib. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a higher death toll in excess of 11,000 people.	1
At the gravesite in a northern Liberia village, there are no religious or traditional burial rites. No ceremony, no mourning, no family members, and no final goodbyes. Nothing but a group of men dressed in space-suit-like outfits, cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave, they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased. These men are part of the country's Ebola response team, specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus. The virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with Ebola, and it is still transferable even from a dead body. To help combat the spread of the disease, the Liberian government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of, or is suspected of having been infected with, Ebola. For months Liberians ignored the directive, fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of Ebola, but here in Lofa County -- ground zero of the country's outbreak -- almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus. Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community, they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely. Safe burials "When it started, it wasn't that easy," says Alpha Tamba, an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County. "It was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death. People preferred driving us away." "We must be grateful for the communities, through the efforts of the local leaders. Now they are disclosing death to us," he explains. Today, the team has been called to a village where a woman has died of unknown causes. It may not have been from the deadly virus, but the villagers are not taking any chances. The Lofa County health team arrives carrying gloves, gowns, goggles and diluted bleach. They suit up: from head to toe, no skin is exposed. On their hands they wear three layers of gloves, securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists. Before they enter the house to collect the body, one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach. Then -- and only then -- can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag, ready for burial.	1
Metallica's Lars Ulrich loves Black Sabbath and Deep Purple -- and so does his 10-year-old son. Actor Rodger Corser plays "Guitar Hero" at an April event in Australia. The game has revived Ã¢ÂÂthe spirit of rock and roll,Ã¢ÂÂ the musician says. (Peter Olesen)AUGUSTUS FLEMING: Lars Ulrich was just one of 13 musicians, journalists, fans and family members turning out to help raise money for Australia's Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFBF), which has partnered with the Metallica Foundation to provide CF Foundation with a special performance of its "Live For the Benefit of a Cure" charity concert.The proceeds will be split equally between the CF Foundation and CFBF.DANIEL "TANK" MCGOVERN: Metallica has a history of giving back in Australia, and its fans. In 1997, the band donated a million dollars to Aussie footballers for every goal they scored.The charity concert will occur at the Sydney Cricket Ground on May 1. The date has also been changed. It will now be May 2.DANIEL MCGOVERN: Last night I played with Lars Ulrich at the Melb Studios in Sydney, along with the Black Sabbath tribute band, The Gathering.It was the second annual Metallica tribute night at Sydney's Melb Studios.MELB AUDIENCE: I was very happy to be involved with Lars and Metallica over the last couple of years as they prepare to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Metallica with the band, as well as their 50th with the band of their own.This is the first time I've seen them in Sydney. I'm very excited to be here.DANIEL MCGOVERN: We had a few days off for the festival, so when the band came back we threw a couple of parties.There are a lot of bands who perform on Fridays, and that's the day I had to be in the office Monday, and it was our first Metallica concert.I'm not a big rock kind of guy. But I was a fan of Metallica from the time I saw their first music video on MTV in the early '80s. So I was very excited to play in front	0
February 13, 2015 A breakthrough in Belarus, a verdict in Italy, and an expected veto in the U.S. all headline CNN Student News this Friday. We're breaking down how vaccines work, and we're exploring five facts about icky germs that could be in your home or school that you've never considered.In the past months, we have covered a major outbreak of measles and the deaths of thousands of people.A new study shows that some children were vaccinated with a weakened form of measles vaccine, and many more are missing important information about how the vaccines — and the measles itself — are administered.In other words, it's not just outbreaks that are getting out of control. The world is getting too comfortable.In the coming days, we'll look at how the measles cases in the United Kingdom and Italy can be traced directly back to MMR vaccine — and, more broadly, how the vaccine schedule, which should be getting smarter and more accurate, is instead getting more complicated.The vaccine you're about to get looks like a red raspberry, but it's made of live but weakened measles virus (or "herpes").It is a powerful tool and is administered by injection to children as young as 6 months with the promise of protecting them against serious disease and death.However, new research argues that this measles vaccine is not as safe and effective as it seems.And that's how the measles virus worksThe measles virus is an extremely infectious virus.It is estimated that as many as 3.4 million people a year get measles.During a measles outbreak, about 90 percent of patients experience symptoms and about 15 percent of patients die from measles.The viruses live in the air, so infected children can be contagious before symptoms appear.And, in the United States, as much as a billion people — or about 30 percent of the world's population — live in areas where measles is common.Measles is highly contagious, so most people cannot avoid exposure to a virus when they are most contagious: right when they're sick or just before they get well again.So, that makes measles an ideal vector for a biological warfare attack.Here are five facts about measles that many people don't know:1) MEASLES VIRUSES AND GERMS ARE NOT THE SAMEThe measles virus and	0
More than $20 million from dozens of clients is unaccounted for in the aftermath of what police say was a murder-suicide by the attorney who invested the money, according to a source with direct knowledge of deceased lawyer William Parente's financial dealings. Police say Stephanie Parente's father killed his family and himself in a Baltimore hotel Monday. Some investors fear their entire life savings have been wiped out, said the source, who based the $20 million amount on knowledge of Parente's finances. Some other investors are missing what could amount to another $7 million, CNN has learned, so the total of missing money tied to Parente could be upwards of $27 million. Baltimore County, Maryland, police say Parente, 59, killed his family before committing suicide. The bodies of Parente, his wife and their two daughters were found in a hotel room in Towson, Maryland, on Monday. The source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive financial information involved, said one investor had been involved with Parente for more than 15 years, receiving regular monthly payments from Parente until April 16, four days before the bodies were found. The source said Parente solicited personal loans from clients at high interest, promising to use the money for bridge financing of real estate projects such as shopping centers. The source did not know whether Parente, of Garden City, New York, had actually used the money for any legitimate investments. The source, who knew Parente for more than 15 years, described him as "serious, somber and conservative." Parente told investors he was generating returns of more than 13 percent even in down markets, according to the source. Investors were not given investment statements and were not charged a management fee, but Parente did provide notices informing investors that he owed them money, according to the source. In other developments Friday, police said Parente bought a set of knives from a Crate and Barrel store in Towson, and one of the knives is believed to be the one Parente later used to take his own life. Baltimore County police said that knife is being tested as evidence in the murder/suicide case. Investigators say they found a receipt for the knife in the hotel room where the deaths took place, and the time stamped on the receipt was 5:25 p.m. Sunday.	1

In travels this week -- to Boston, Chicago, New York -- friends and strangers alike have said the same thing: They are turned off and tuned out of the sequestration mess in Washington. To a person, they are sick of the antics of ersatz government, of fake crises, of a government being out of control. They understand that in order for the health of our democracy to survive and flourish, our members of Congress need to have a seat at the table, to be informed of and involved in this process, to participate in government, to be able to call on and to call out representatives who are not acting in full and absolute good faith.This is not the place to analyze the reasons for how far over the cliff we have fallen, how many of us have become part of the problem, or for what purpose the sequestration happened. Instead, I will simply offer a few thoughts on why the sequestration is an important political issue and how you can act to make your voice heard.Why The Sequester Is An Important Political IssueOur democracy has been shaken by the sequester. In fact, it is the reason we have a sequester. It was not simply that sequestration was proposed but that it was enacted. It is the result of a decision that was made and implemented in an attempt to achieve a false sense of consensus on the part of both parties regarding the sequester. It serves to send a message that members of Congress are not taking our nation's most serious problems seriously enough. It is an effort to undermine our work to reform the health insurance system by shutting down the Affordable Care Act. It is an effort to weaken our ability to address our debt by depriving the Federal Government of a small amount of money. Its purpose is to make life hard for members of Congress who have taken a vow of service to the country -- and that is an attempt, I suspect, to undermine the power of service among all citizens for the purpose of promoting a false sense of consensus on all major governmental issues. If a citizen wants to get off the bus, to get off the train, it's the bus, it's the train, it's the train. If that citizen votes with the opposition party, he or she is probably an idiot. This is a good example of why people are tuning out.I do not mean to be disrespectful to anyone who wants the country to work again – and I have voted for Democrats in the past	0
India on Wednesday invited the Prime Minister of its archrival Pakistan to the swearing-in of its new leader, Narendra Modi. Invitations were extended to the heads of all eight countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which includes Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Indian external affairs ministry said. "This is the first time that India has invited all SAARC members to attend a swearing-in ceremony of a prime minister," ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said. Asked whether the move marked the start of a better relationship with Pakistan, he remarked, "Let's take one step at a time. "At this stage, the invitations have gone. Let's take responses on this and we will take it from there, rather than jump to conclusions on the basis of our first step." The swearing-in is set to take place Monday.	1
There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare: Mutual assured destruction. What it means is that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. When discussing nuclear weapons, there are two key words that describe how each nation's nuclear arsenals are perceived. The first is the word mutual assured destruction. According to the dictionary definition, this means the following: "A nuclear weapon that eliminates the adversary's military advantage by simultaneously destroying all of its missiles, bombers, and warheads". The second key word is nuclear. This word, as the definition makes clear, is the weapon itself. It is a single, fissionable atomic bomb. Nuclear weapons are weapons that use controlled nuclear explosions. Nuclear weapons do not use the heat or the blast effect of an atomic bomb to destroy and kill. Instead, a nuclear weapon creates a nuclear explosion that destroys its target. That was why a nuclear weapon is called nuclear. One atomic bomb will not destroy an entire city. A single atomic bomb would not destroy the entire American population of the entire world. It is the nature of the fission process. That is why atomic bombs must be aimed at their intended target. This difference between atomic bombs and even small nuclear devices is what makes the threat of nuclear warfare so horrific. An atomic bomb is only capable of wiping out a city. One nuclear device is capable of wiping out a city, an entire nation, and an entire world. This is the difference between a single nuclear bomb and a global thermonuclear bomb. When you consider how dangerous an atomic bomb would be to carry on the battlefield and what it would do to a person if used in a terrorist attack, this is not a trivial difference. These are not the two main types of weapons for nuclear weapons, so how and where nuclear weapons used in warfare will be a key issue for the future of nuclear weapons. The number of nuclear weapons in the world has historically been limited to just two types: nuclear and thermonuclear. Of the two, nuclear weapons are the most powerful and the most powerful in the sense that it is much more destructive than a thermonuclear weapon. Currently, over 100 countries have access to nuclear weapons and over 3,000 nuclear weapons are present.The main nuclear states (currently, only the United States has nuclear weapons) are estimated to have around 500 nuclear weapons. In addition to these, around 50 countries have nuclear weapons that	0
Hillary Clinton will likely run for president of the United States. But forgive the U.S.'s neighbors to the North for thinking the former secretary of state is considering a bid at prime minster, too. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Hillary Clinton has headlined six events in Canada and organizers in the country announced two more appearances in two different provinces on Monday. Clinton will speak at an event in Winnipeg, Manitoba sponsored by CIBC, a large bank in Canada, on January 21, 2015, according to this ticket page. That same day, Clinton will speak at a similar event - also sponsored by CIBC, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, according to a press release. The opportunities in Canada not only allow her to make money off of speaker fees, but it gives her a platform to discuss global affairs and her time running the State Department, a subject she's pretty comfortable revisiting. With the addition of these appearances, Clinton has now headlined events in six of Canada's ten provinces (the country also has three territories). Her other appearances include: June 20, 2013 in Toronto, Ontario for Unique Lives and Experiences. March 5, 2014 in Vancouver, British Columbia for Board of Trade's Women's Leadership Circle March 6, 2014 in Calgary, Alberta for an event organized by TINEPUBLIC March 18, 2014 in Montreal, Quebec for a speech to the Montreal Board of Trade June 16, 2014 in Edmonton, Alberta for an event promoting her memoir "Hard Choices" October 6, 2014 for the Ottawa, Ontario for an event organized by Canada 20/20 (Clinton was interviewed on stage by CIBC CEO Victor Dodig at this event) Clinton's events in Canada have run the gamut, from speeches at high priced dinners to question and answer sessions in theaters. Most have been promoted and organized by TINEPUBLIC, a special events and conference organizer in Canada. CNN's calls to the group went unanswered on Monday. One thing is consistent for nearly every event Clinton does in Canada: At some point, she is asked about the Keystone XL pipeline. At her June event in Edmonton, Clinton gave hope to both sides of the debate over the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States, but declined to comment on whether she would approve the project or not.	1
In a down economy, pursuing the American dream can be challenging, but restaurant owner Todd Steele was willing to take a chance. For nearly 20 years, Steele worked all levels of the restaurant game, from dishwasher to general manager, before partnering with his mom and opening his own eatery called Metrovino on Portland, Oregon's, 11th Avenue streetcar line. "I would not have picked this spot if it weren't for the streetcar, and my business has certainly benefited from our location," Steele said. "Streetcars are also a romantic way to travel, and they are fun to watch from inside Metrovino." While America lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s, a few cities have kept the romance burning. The heart of San Francisco includes its nearly 140-year-old electric cable car system. In New Orleans, the location for Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," many tourists are drawn by the picturesque St. Charles Avenue Line. The Obama administration recently offered some U.S. cities a piece of a  $130 million federal fund for streetcar projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion, cutting pollution and reliance on foreign oil, and creating jobs. Transit systems in Dallas, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Charlotte, North Carolina, are slated to share grants from the Federal Transit Administration's Urban Circulator program. Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects, too. See map for key projects But not everyone is a fan of streetcars. "This is a waste of money," said Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation. "Streetcars certainly create jobs, but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value," he said. "Because it requires extensive ongoing subsidies, it is also unsustainable. Improving roads would be the better bet in most communities." CNN iReporter Raymond Becich is a supporter. "Sure, Portland paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar (line)," he said. "But how is this any different than any governmental jurisdiction giving tax breaks and other incentives for businesses to relocate to a city or state?" Streetcars have transformed a "blighted warehouse district ... into a vibrant area of shops, grocery stores, restaurants and apartments that provide entertainment and employment," he said.	1
It all starts on the sixth floor of the five-star Lotte Hotel, in the center of Seoul. After booking my place for Panmunjom Travel Center's Combined Tour, I show up at the agency office at 7:45 on a chilly Friday morning  with a six-hour layover planned. We walk across to the hotel lobby, where, to my surprise, another member of the company greets us."You're here," she says, with a smile. "Welcome."At once, I wonder if this is the company's first trip to Panmunjom. Maybe she's there to welcome me. I can feel the tension that this is a bit early, and no one has confirmed our itinerary. I want to get away from the office, and so I say, "Can we start now? Because I really don't have much time."The employee nods as though in agreement, and she walks me to our first stop, which is the Panmunjom Foreign Affairs Building, the first of what will soon be a series of South and North Korean sites we're planning across this trip. Before we go inside, I ask her, "Why there?""There are so many. The South Korean government is building a map of its history and culture. The Chinese government has planned an exhibit on the history of North Korea. So many things are going on. North Korea is like your home to the world at the moment."I'm not entirely happy with this answer, but as I start to walk back to the office, I can tell she's right—that there are so many things happening now, and that the South Korean government is now working to create a history of its own inside of Panmunjom.The two of us walk through the South Korean Foreign Affairs Building. I'm reminded of a tour that I took at the United Nations in New York. This building was a gift to the United Nations from the South Korean government in recognition for all the help the United Nations has provided to South and North Korea; they built it to display the work of the International Red Cross, along with a huge exhibit on its own building, the Red Cross. The red cross is displayed under the roof, and the entire building is covered with a huge, multilevel, glass-walled atrium, displaying the work and dedication of the International Red Cross.The first two halls	0
Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa. Residents in Sanaa are stranded in their homes, and some even fear looking out of their windows as they are left to wonder how long the violence will rage around them. "We can't leave our houses to get food for our children. As soon as we walk on the street we are shot," says Rami al-Shaibani, a Sanaa resident. Thousands protested in Sanaa's Change Square last week, but this week the square has been quiet, except for groups of youths carrying away the dead and helping the injured. Multiple witnesses and medics said dozens were killed in a violent government crackdown that started on Sunday. Protesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a attack in June on his palace but has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term. Each wounded protester was carried by six or seven others -- sometimes friends of the casualty -- and taken to the medical camp in the square. Drops of blood created trails on the ground tracing the long, bloody route to a field hospital. At the medical camp, hundreds of young people were covered in blood and screaming from pain. Thousands more volunteered and donated blood for those in need. It seemed that not a minute passed without another injured youth entering the medical camp. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for calm in Yemen, which, it said, is facing an "unprecedented level of violence." With the limited-capacity field hospital full of patients, doctors made a desperate call for volunteers to try to help save the injured. Dozens were killed and more than 700 were wounded -- many of them by gunshots -- over the last three days in clashes with the military, according to medical staff in Change Square. Eyewitnesses said they had seen snipers on the rooftops of buildings surrounding the square firing almost continuously. In one incident, an ambulance carrying three injured protesters flipped over when a rocket propelled grenade hit it, killing all five on board, the medical staff added. Abdul Rahman Barman, the executive director of a local human rights organization, said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime is attacking with no limits and does not differentiate between civilians, protesters or gunmen.	1
Investigators are working to determine what caused a helicopter crash in central Peru that killed seven people, including five Americans. The team was supporting oil exploration in the village of Pucara, where the helicopter crashed around 7:45 p.m. Saturday when it encountered turbulence in the area. Seven people were confirmed dead, including four U.S. service members, two Peruvian employees and a British citizen. Five more people were missing, including the four U.S. service members, according to the Air Force.A helicopter crashed into the jungle near the village of Pucara in southern Peru, killing seven crew members when it encountered turbulence during an oil exploration flight, an official said Sunday.A Cessna 182, carrying pilots Matthew T.

One doctor says the study "very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine." A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder. Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007. The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups, who have long blamed mercury, a neurotoxin, for the disorder. For years, parents have been concerned that a mercury-containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism. But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines. The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism, although advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected. Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent: Let me explain. In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines. Some people believed autism would decrease as a result, because they thought the two were connected. A new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry says this just didn't happen. Researchers looked at cases of autism in California after 1999. They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed. Just the opposite happened. From 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3- to 5-year-olds, the autism rate continued to go up, from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California.	1
A Texas community is on edge after a district attorney who said he would put away the "scum" who killed a colleague two months ago was shot to death alongside his wife in his home Saturday night. Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he thought there was a "strong connection" between the slayings of Mike and Cynthia McLelland and the shooting death of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. Hasse and McLelland "worked on similar cases very closely," said Wood, the county's top elected official. And Kaufman Mayor William Fortner told CNN that he thought the men were targeted by people seeking revenge. "That's the logical conclusion, and I don't have any information that directs me to think that's the case, but that's what you would assume under the circumstances, since they targeted two people from our prosecutors." The Kaufman County sheriff's office, however, won't officially say the killings are connected. "I can't say that," Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes told reporters. "No, we have nothing indicating that for sure." Federal and state law enforcement descended rapidly on the crime scene to aid in the investigation. Just two months ago, McLelland vowed to find the people who killed Hasse, one of his top deputies. On Saturday, authorities found the McLellands' bodies in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. "I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm," Fortner said. "As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney." Fortner said he hoped the killer or killers were caught "before any more people are lost." Wood and McLelland last spoke last week. "He never stated to me that he was worried," Wood said. "But everybody that works in the courthouse has been on edge, but he never indicated any fear to me." Authorities are providing extra security for others, and the Kaufman County district attorney's office will be closed on Monday. "We are taking precautions to protect other elected officials in the county," Byrnes told reporters Sunday. He declined to say what those measures were. Byrnes offered no details as to how the McLellands were killed.	1
On CNN's "State of the Union," host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Missouri to learn about the effects of cutbacks on an already struggling economy. St. Louis, Missouri, is having to cut back on bus routes. This could devastate some of the area's most vulnerable. BALLWIN, Missouri (CNN)  -- For Stuart and Dianne Falk, it is a two-bus, 45-minute trip into downtown St. Louis to head to the gym and to volunteer at a theater group. And it is a lifeline that ends Friday. "To be saddled, to be imprisoned, that is what it is going to feel like," says Stuart Falk. "It is going to feel like being punished for something we didn't do." Stuart and Dianne Falk are both in wheelchairs. And the bus route that takes them downtown, and to one of the few tastes of personal freedom they have, is being eliminated because of a funding crunch. In all, two dozen bus routes are being eliminated outright effective March 30. Numerous other routes have been shortened or otherwise modified, including less frequent runs. Light rail service schedules also have been scaled back as part of an effort to close a $51 million funding shortfall.  Watch the Falks ride bus that is about to be eliminated » The reasons for the funding crunch have little to do with President Obama, or the federal government at all for that matter. But there are several connections to the big national political debates of the past several months, stretching back to last fall. It was then that St. Louis County voters were asked to vote in favor of a small tax increase to add funding for bus routes and other mass transit operations in the bedroom communities surrounding the city of St. Louis. Backers were optimistic, but then saw the mood change as the struggles on Wall Street mounted, and dropping 401(k) balances made voters more stingy. It didn't help, these backers contend, that anger at the first installment of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout also was festering on Election Day. Now, St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley worries the cutbacks will have an adverse effect on an already struggling area economy.	1

British Prime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP, whose leaking well has caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history, when he speaks by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama this weekend, Cameron's office at Downing Street said Friday. It will be a "routine call" and BP will be one of several issues they discuss, Downing Street said, without providing more information. The phone call follows concern about anti-British rhetoric from Obama and others in America about BP's role in the disaster. London Mayor Boris Johnson said the remarks are "slightly worrying" and Piers Morgan, a British TV host and former newspaper editor, said Obama seems to be on "an absolute witch hunt" against the BP boss. "You know, accidents do happen," Morgan told CNN's "Connect the World" on Thursday night. "There are major issues in terms of safety here, in terms of environmental tragedy that's going on where this spillage is occurring, but I think simply to demand the guy's head on a plate when he's trying to fix it is not sensible politics, and it's slightly self-serving. "And I, if I was Barack Obama, would cool the rhetoric. I wouldn't make it a British thing, because BP is not a British company anymore, they are an international company. And it's looking to me a little like Brit-bashing." Johnson told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday he wants to see "cool heads and a bit of calm reflection" about the problem, "rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling." He said many British pension funds are exposed to BP and could be at risk if the company's share price plummets. "I do think that it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the international airwaves," he said, adding that the disaster is the result of an accident that BP is trying to remedy. "Ultimately (BP) cannot be faulted because, I'm sorry, it was an accident that took place, and BP, I think, is paying a very, very heavy price indeed." Obama said earlier this week that he was talking with experts about the oil disaster so "I know whose ass to kick." U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said BP was probably lying in its comments about the spill.	1
In "The Hot Country," U.S. troops invade a foreign country where oil interests are at stake, a rising foreign power is looking to derail U.S. forces using cloak and dagger tactics, and there's a gunfight in the desert against insurgent enemies. DÃ©jÃ  vu, anyone? As contemporary as this story sounds, it doesn't take place in the Middle East, and it's not set in modern times. The latest novel from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Olen Butler uses the Battle of Vera Cruz and the American invasion of Mexico during that country's civil war in 1914 as its backdrop. Butler takes an often-overlooked chapter of history and turns it into a whip-smart tale of intrigue and espionage. At the center of this swashbuckling thriller is Christopher Marlowe Cobb, an American newspaper war correspondent, better known as "Kit." Covering the war in enemy territory, he's nearly shot by a mysterious sniper, joins forces with a double agent, is almost killed by a German army officer and falls in love with a headstrong young Mexican woman who may be mixed up in the revolutionary plot. You don't need to be an expert on the era to enjoy the story, but history buffs will appreciate cameos from real-life characters like Jack London, Richard Harding Davis and Pancho Villa. Butler recently spoke with CNN about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind your new novel?	1
A time capsule hidden for more than a hundred years at one of Boston's most popular tourist attractions was opened on Friday in Boston. According to the Bostonian Society, which maintains the 1713-built Old Massachusetts State House, the rectangular copper box containing a variety of artifacts from 1901 was sealed inside one of two iconic statues -- a lion and a unicorn -- that have been a familiar site atop the Old State House for a couple of centuries. The Bostonian Society didn't -- or couldn't -- fully divulge the 113-year-old time capsule's contents, explaining that "the process of extracting documents that are old and probably fragile will need to be slow and careful." But a Boston Globe article from February 24, 1901, detailed what went into the box, which the story predicted would "prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence." According to the Globe, the box included the photographs and autographs of local statesmen such as Massachusetts Gov. Winthrop M. Crane and Boston Mayor Thomas Norton Hart, as well as news clippings of the day from several city newspapers and even a "letter to posterity from the reporters of the Boston Daily newspapers assigned to City Hall." It also included a photograph of the "5th Massachusetts Regiment on its way to Framingham to be mustered in as U.S. volunteers for service in the war against Spain," as well as "campaign buttons for McKinley, Roosevelt and John D. Long for vice president." The box was sealed inside the lion's head by Samuel Rogers, a local coppersmith who was part of the crew renovating the nearly 200-year-old State House. Although the occasion was detailed in the city's largest newspaper, the Bostonian Society said its current staff was unaware of the time capsule until they received a letter from a descendent of Rogers alerting them to it.	1
President Obama said Monday he will attempt to block bonuses to executives at ailing insurance giant AIG, payments he described as an "outrage." President Obama says AIG "finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and ickiness." ( AP: Susan Walsh ) He went on to say that he might have to "use the powers of the Office of Management and Budget to stop any bonuses for any company doing business with the federal government."A former AIG chief executive made that possible by pushing a $90 million bonus to a top executive when he joined his new company, which had no experience running federal programs and is in poor financial shape.The former chief executive and a director of the company are now being charged in the government's largest-ever financial fraud investigation. Prosecutors say that between $3.5 billion and $7.2 billion in bonuses were awarded to executives with no experience running government programs.The U.S. Department of Justice says the company fraudulently collected more than $165 million in payments over a six-year period by overcharging Medicare and other taxpayers for government contracts.The company also misled Medicare and state and local officials about cost overruns and other problems, prosecutors said.AIG says that the U.S. government's allegations are an "attack based on fiction and innuendo."The company issued a statement Monday saying the U.S. department's accusations are "totally without merit.""The facts show this is an abuse of process and a campaign that, on its face, does not comply with legal requirements," the statement said.The government alleges that, while AIG executives were paid millions in bonuses, they never worked on programs with taxpayer funds that the company could use to earn profits.Instead, the government says, AIG paid about $150,000 in bonuses to people who were responsible for its decision to buy and merge another insurance company — American Home Assurance — and for managing a large portfolio of auto-insurance claims.After the merger, which AIG called "the most consequential strategic transaction in the history of the company," AIG paid the merger's top executive more than $1.4 million in bonuses.Prosecutors say that AIG executives and their top lawyer were aware of the deal's potential problems."AIG's board knowingly broke the law by awarding millions of dollars in	0
Alaska officials have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block -- at least temporarily -- same-sex marriage from moving ahead in the state. A resolution could come as early as Friday. A federal judge there last week had ordered gay and lesbian couples be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period. But everything is now on hold until the justices issue an order. If the state loses at the high court, same-sex marriage could begin at 11 a.m. local time Friday. Alaska's Department of Law said "the state cannot issue any marriage licenses until the stay is lifted." Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted an expedited consideration. The state then asked for a stay, saying it needs more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage is being usurped by the courts. Officials, including the governor said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved is best for all Alaskans. "Without a stay, the interim licensing of marriages contrary to Alaska law could easily lead to administrative chaos that will harm everyone's interest in the orderly enforcement of domestic relations laws," said the state's high court appeal. But a number of same-sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in Nevada and Idaho as unconstitutional. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction includes Alaska and other Western states. The high court case is Parnell v. Hamby (14A413).	1
Six months ago, a Long Island convenience store owner turned a would-be robbery into an act of compassion. On Wednesday, the shoplifter made amends with a $50 bill and a thank you letter for saving him from a life of crime. The story began in May 2009, when Mohammad Sohail of Shirley, New York, was closing his Shirley Express convenience store one night. Security camera footage from that evening shows a man wielding a baseball bat barging into the store and demanding money. Sohail had a rifle ready and quickly aimed it directly in the robber's face, forcing the man to drop the bat and lay on the ground. Unbeknownst to the man, Sohail never loads his gun. According to Sohail, the man immediately started to plead with him, tearfully saying, "I'm sorry, I have no food. I have no money. My whole family is hungry. Don't call the police. Don't shoot me." "When I see him starting crying [those] things, I really feel bad for him," said Sohail. "I say, oh man, this is something different." Sohail made the man pledge never to rob anybody ever again, then gave the man $40 and a loaf bread. Sohail, who is from Pakistan, said the man then wanted to be a Muslim like him, so he recited an Islamic oath and gave the would-be robber the name Nawaz Sharif Zardari. Sohail went to get some milk, but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food. Both Mohammad Sohail and Suffolk County Police have no idea who the man is. After the May incident, Sohail explained that he will "absolutely not" be pressing charges, though police are still investigating the case. Over the past six months, Sohail's story of sympathy and kindness has inspired many across the country. The Shirley Express store has received numerous letters of admiration. "No person has ever moved my spirit the way you did. From your biggest admirer," one letter says. "Great men are capable of great acts. You are a great American," another reads.	1
The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that evidence so far shows only conservative groups underwent extra scrutiny cited by an inspector general's disclosure of the agency's targeting of applications for tax exempt status. An initial report on the IRS targeting scandal this week by Daniel Werfel, the IRS principal deputy commissioner, led to the disclosure that IRS workers flagged both liberal and conservative groups when assessing their eligibility for the tax break available to social welfare organizations. IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as "tea party" on "Be on the Lookout" or BOLO lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible, according to Werfel and the inspector general who first revealed the targeting. Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria including "progressives," but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity faced by conservative groups, according to a letter to the panel this week by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation. The revelation bolstered the argument of GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the panel's chairman, that the targeting had a political motive. "So far, the evidence only shows conservatives being systematically targeted by the IRS, not just flagged through the BOLO, but actually targeted," Camp said, later conceding "we're in the early stages of this investigation." Werfel repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete, and that additional information from continuing investigations by the FBI, the inspector general and congressional committees was needed to reach definitive conclusions. He noted that the 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break included a diverse range of political leanings. "I didn't want to leave the committee with the impression that we're not seeing diversity of political labels across the spectrum," Werfel said of the IRS targeting. "What I'm suggesting is more analysis -- significant more analysis -- is needed before we reach conclusions about what that means in terms of an IRS failure or an IRS issue."	1
When Macau unveiled record gambling revenues on Tuesday, the government was silent about the source of much of the cash fuelling the territory's boom: illegal money transfers from mainland China. From pawn shops offering money withdrawal ices to black-market casinos, Macau's economy has proved a magnet for cash and tax evasion.With Macau now poised to overtake Hong Kong as the world's fourth biggest gambling enclave by revenue, it is easy to mistake Macau's success as a byproduct of high-stakes play and a boom in the Chinese economy, rather than a direct result of the cash the gamblers are earning.The truth is that casinos, and many other businesses, depend on the flow of high-value money from mainland China, the most lucrative source in the region. Indeed at a time when Chinese government restrictions on money transfers are biting, the continued flow of the mainland's wealth into the offshore financial system should concern governments around the world more than ever.Money transfers have always been a problem in Macau, but not until Chinese cash floods the territory has the amount of money moving between mainland and overseas been seen like in Hong Kong. In 2015, Hong Kong was forced to intervene in a dispute between a casino company and a family in Macau who was trying to move their foreign casino winnings overseas to mainland China. The casino company had demanded to be paid in Chinese currency that was not legal tender in Hong Kong, and when the family refused to pay, the casino sued.The family eventually agreed to pay $7m (£4.8m), but it turned out the money was not actually moving overseas, it was a family trust in Macau that withdrew the funds. Hong Kong found the family had moved $7m into Hong Kong and took a 25 per cent stake in the casino company.Macau's offshore financial system became a place where the Chinese could send their money to avoid having to declare their income on tax forms. The problem was exacerbated by a law in Macau that banned offshore bank accounts for citizens and residents of the territory. While the law was being debated, the Chinese government announced a series of measures that allowed large numbers of Chinese nationals to buy their way into the casino business."It is absolutely crucial to have an effective overseas tax system," says Robert Du Pont, an economist at Hong Kong University and deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Financial Services Association."This is the single most	0
Richard Serra stands in the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, his hair as white as the marble floor. The summer sun of New York radiates from the towering metal of his monumental works. He breaks no sweat. He likes how the weeping beeches and birches have leafed out since April when two of his enormous steel sculptures were installed. A crane lifted the tonnage over the garden wall from West 54th Street. This new foliage, he notes, shades his works' rising, rusting arcs with an air of mystery. "You can't see 'Ellipse' from 'Intersection.' So as you walk out of one, you're not thinking about the other." What you're thinking about may be their size. "Intersection II" is more than 13 feet tall and 51 feet long. "Torqued Ellipse IV" at one point is 32 feet across. Made to be entered, explored, felt in terms of how they divide and define space around you, these gentle, giant landmarks of a 40-year career place Serra today at the very heart of the Museum of Modern Art's mission and capabilities.  Watch videos in which Serra describes the MoMA retrospective and walks you through several of his sculptures » For a long moment, Serra takes in his own work. These are bafflingly graceful walls of 2-inch-thick steel, mottled and rough. This engaging, articulate man knows how to bend and balance the plates so gorgeously hunkered down in a place usually ruled by far smaller works of Picasso, Giacometti, Rodin, Alexander Calder and Henry Moore. Serra smiles. "You know what? When they take my work back out of here, this place is going to look like a peewee golf course." That won't happen until September. Until then, MoMA's new exhibition, "Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years," reveals that sense of humor along with the sophisticated spatial concepts the Californian explains as he leads you, glad for your interest, across a terrain all his.  See a gallery of images for perspective on the geometric line, shape and volume of Serra's work » Born in San Francisco in 1939, educated at Yale, a former painter whose study of art and tradition in Europe left him searching for more dimensions, Serra today is one of the most widely applauded sculptors alive.	1
The mother of a 17-year-old Rochester, New York, high school student who vanished over the weekend on spring break in Myrtle Beach, says she was forced to bury her teenage son in a shallow grave after he was abducted by a stranger.The 17-year-old was found dead in a shallow grave Tuesday, according to police.After investigators began suspecting foul play and called off the search, the girl's mother, Michelle M. Brown, said her son died of dehydration.A Rochester Public School district public safety spokesman told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle that the unidentified suspect was a local man who had previously used an alias in a string of disturbing incidents.Brown told the newspaper that her son is the biological daughter of someone she knew as "Lucky" for nearly 15 years."My husband and I have not received any explanation about his whereabouts other than it's safe to say he was abducted," she told the newspaper. "The last time we spoke with him was Saturday evening at the house. Then Tuesday morning he didn't return home. We were worried sick because we thought he was dead."No other details about the abduction were released.After the boy was reported missing, a man was seen wearing camouflage pants and a baseball cap walking on the roadway in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, NBC station WRAL (http://www.wral.com) reported.According to WRAL, the teenager's family had asked authorities to investigate whether the man might be the one who took her.Brown told WRAL that she was not notified that her son was missing until Monday, May 18.The girl had been out to Myrtle Beach over spring break with family and friends, according to WRAL.

The death toll on both sides from hostilities in Israel and Gaza is now over 1,000; among them are scores of children, and many more civilians are injured. Thousands are forced to flee their homes, and those who stay are left terrified by the bombs raining down. As negotiations for a cease-fire continue, many organizations have begun to provide relief to those in harm's way and to protect those affected by the crisis. UNICEF estimates that thousands of families in Gaza have seen their homes destroyed or damaged. "UNICEF and partners are procuring essential pediatric drugs for hospitals and health facilities," its website says, "and child protection teams are helping children and their caregivers cope with the psychological distress." The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is also on the ground in both Gaza and Israel. In Gaza, it is providing first aid and emergency support, with several medical centers operating where casualties are worst. Teams were able to enter some of the worst hit areas during short-lived ceasefires to help evacuate victims, many of whom were trapped in the rubble of destroyed buildings. In Israel, Red Cross partner organization Magen David Adom says it has treated hundreds for shrapnel injuries and psychological trauma. The organization is also providing ambulance transport for some critical patients transferred from Gaza. UNICEF stressed that "the escalating violence in Gaza and Israel threatens devastating physical harm and mental distress for children on all sides, the effects of which can last a lifetime as their sense of security is undermined." The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee is working with the elderly and disabled in Israel to ensure that they have access to food and supplies, and providing psychosocial support for children in shelters. The Jewish Federations of North America are helping those Israelis in rocket range find safe spaces, as well as providing trauma counseling and other emergency services. The organization Medecins sans Frontieres has been supporting Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City with a surgical team and other medical supplies. Save the Children has been working with local partners in Gaza to provide medical supplies and help those who have lost their homes with necessities such as baby food and mattresses. Mercy Corps is also providing assistance to civilians in Gaza, delivering food and necessities to those who need them, as well as medical kits to hospitals and clinics. As the conflict continues, pleas for peace echoed around the world.	1
It all started with some boxes that had not been opened for 80 years. "There was a rumor that there were archives in the Condé Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about," says Todd Brandow, a photography curator. "It was difficult to get access, but when I finally got in, they told me that it had all been sold and nothing was left. "But then the archivist rolled out these boxes of 2,000 prints. It was one of those great 'oh my God' moments." Among the prints were photographic portraits of Winston Churchill, Katharine Hepburn, HG Wells, George Gershwin, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, WB Yeats, Fred Astaire, and countless other luminaries of the 1920s and 1930s. None of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades, and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue. Also included in the stash were Art Deco-style portraits of women modeling designs by Chanel, Lanvin, Lelong, Schiaparelli and many others. The photographs are now being exhibited at London's Photographer's Gallery, where they will show until 18 January. The Picasso of photography "It was a kid-in-a-candy-store feeling," Brandow recalls. "They were taken almost 100 years ago but the pictures felt so contemporary, that's what really excited me. All the poses were so natural, and the vision was so fresh. "Many of them were fashion pictures, but the women looked like they'd been born wearing those clothes, that they wore them every day. That was Steichen's skill: he could make people look natural in every sense of the word." During his lifetime, Steichen was recognized as the most important photographer of his age. Even today, says Natalie Herschdorfer, an art historian who co-curated the exhibition with Brandow, he is "one of the top five photographers of all time". "He was the Picasso of photography," she says. "He had a 70-year career covering the whole 20th Century. All the genres of modern photography are represented in his work, from the pictorial style of the 1900s to the modernist period. It's very rare."	1
Rip it up and start again. As a 20-year-old, Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros' clay courts. All the portents suggested great things were ahead of the Serbian. Here was a tennis player with an impressive Ã¢ÂÂwow factorÃ¢ÂÂ who had the ball in her court for the first time in her life. She was only 19. The only thing standing in the way of her glory was a bit of bad luck. Ana Ivanovic found a way to lose her way to Roland Garros after that first victory. Ã‚Â“Ã‚Â”Ã‚Â“Ã‚Â“ She lost the next two Grand Slam finals to Serena Williams - the first time Williams had beaten Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam final. Even when she won her third French Open title in 2006, Ivanovic was beaten by Venus Williams in the final.Her life was not always easy. Playing in all four grand slam finals in that year, she had to deal with injury. She missed part of 2009 due to surgery on her left knee. Following those two losses, Ivanovic found herself out of tennis playing more and more on the tennis tours that she previously played on. The rest of 2010 was spent on tour and in training, often travelling with a broken foot. She had to leave her house and family and move to a small village in her native Serbia because of an injury to her tennis elbow.She eventually returned as a fully-fledged tennis-playing professional. She said of that move - "I couldn't have had a worse year than the one before. I have never experienced such loneliness, which was also the worst for me. The only thing I had left was tennis. I knew that, when I returned, I was going to be back in some kind of shape and, from that moment on, things changed for the better. I was now healthy. I was back on the tennis map. Now I had to take off my shoulder pads and use my body a bit and put in a little something."At 29, she was the world's most sought-after player. She was signed by Andy Roddick's coach, John McEnroe, as part of a five-player global roster. She was the undisputed world No 1 when she won her first Wimbledon	0
Millions of "Game of Thrones" fans are feeling sadness, outrage, and, sure, some perverse excitement after watching Sunday's episode titled "The Rains of Castamere." But for Game ers who are not fans, "The Rains of Castamere" marked the series' first-ever appearance of a character named Maester Aemon Targaryen -- the most important Game of Thrones character yet (and maybe ever, if you've ever wondered about the relationship between Game and Game of Thrones. Go ahead.)Fans of the series were excited to watch Maester Aemon "kill" Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Sansa Stark on their wedding night, and to see what happens to him in King's Landing. And it was all wonderful, but the episode also had some problems, mostly related to character development. Here, we examine how "The Rains of Castamere" does and doesn't deal with the main character of Game of Thrones, Maester Aemon Targaryen, the most essential character yet from the series.The Rains of CastamereIn this episode, Maester Aemon Targaryen becomes Lord Eddard's new bodyguard. He makes the character his official replacement, the role he has wanted since the beginning of the series, and has been waiting for since his first appearance, as Maester in the prologue. On the one hand, he's had the character waiting for him the whole series, and on the other, it's been years and he's already gotten used to his new position, which, though not a king's position, is still a very powerful role, perhaps even more powerful than any other in Westeros. (If you've seen the episode "The Long Night," you might remember that Maester Aemon is the first thing Lord Eddard says after he sees Jon Snow walking in, a sentiment which he repeats to Sansa. Maester Aemon's name is first mentioned right after he sees Jon Snow -- it's almost as if he's looking over his shoulder and seeing who is going to say the thing he's been dreading: "My lord.")Eddard and Sansa take their vows as married couple. Maester Aemon takes a little bit of time in the prologue to explain why he had to do what he did. He explains that he was "in pain and weakness," as he put it,	0
The last survivor of the Titanic, 97-year-old Millvina Dean, is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills. Millvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers. The auction, which is expected to raise up to $50,000 for her, is set to take place Saturday near her home in England. It is the second auction in less than a year for Dean, who was a 9-week-old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house. "Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack," Aldridge said. After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions. "There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it," Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag. Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, "we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480). If it was the bag she was rescued in, it would be £30,000 to £40,000, ($44,800 to $60,000), but we can't prove it. It depends on what people are prepared to believe." Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible. "She's in a residential nursing home. She's 97 years of age. She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees," he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for. "As she said, £3,000 a month is £36,000 a year, which is a lot of money," he said. "When she runs out of money, the state will pay fees for her, but while she can pay her fees, she decides where she gets her care. When the state pays, they decide."	1
Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it. Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups' performances of his songs, he made a record with them. The singer-songwriter says he was beyond impressed when he stumbled across videos of university a cappella groups singing covers of his songs on YouTube. "I was really moved," he says. "I thought it was better than what I had done when I first heard it. That's how it struck me because it was so fresh." And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers. The North Carolina native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for "Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!" (Epic), which came out Tuesday. And to give the music a "field recording" feel, he kept the process simple: Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones, and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes. "It's a completely different point of view," says Folds, 42, of the students' renderings of his tunes. "They're not signed singers and artists that have their egos to contend with. And sometimes they're not thinking about the song that much, which I think is kind of cool." But not wanting to have the thunder completely stolen from him (and probably to entice his loyal fans to shell out for the album) Folds sings two a cappella tracks himself: "Boxing" from his Ben Folds Five days, and "Effington" from his 2008 solo album "Way To Normal." "It was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up," he says. "We didn't have a bunch of people to work with and I just about gave up." Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Is this the one and only Ben Folds greatest hits album? Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is. I mean I was looking for something like that -- to possibly do a live orchestral album where the best material would kind of float to the top.	1
Tori Sisson and Shanté Wolfe of Tuskegee, Alabama, camped outside the Montgomery County Courthouse overnight, hoping that when the sun rose Monday, they'd be the first same-sex couple to be legally married in the state of Alabama. As the sun rose Monday morning, both were nervous, but the joy on their faces told them they were not alone, either.From ABC News RadioNovember 16, 2004Alabama Judge Rejects Same-Gender Marriage CasesALABAMA, Ala. - The Alabama Supreme Court on Monday rejected two same-sex marriage cases. In total, 23 states across the U.S. could be affected by the ruling. Alabama is the 16th state to reject gay marriage.In his eight-page decision, Justice Roy Moore wrote that the Alabama legislature did not intend to allow gay marriages and did not have the authority to do so. The majority opinion also found that the legislature’s passage of a bill recognizing gay marriages was unconstitutional."Since the passage of Amendment 1, Alabama has adhered to the principle that the people are sovereign in their sphere of influence, and that legislation cannot bind the people from exercising their right to marry,” Moore wrote. “The Legislature is sovereign in only three limited areas,” he explained. “The people can change the Constitution. The people can amend their laws. The people can enter into an act of grace and ask God’s blessing on the law. The people cannot alter a valid statute.”Moore also denied that it would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny gay couples the right to marry in Alabama“Gay marriage is not a fundamental right. It is a creation of the State. It is a privilege available to the people of this State and not a fundamental right,” the judge declared. “The right to engage in private conduct as marriage in the State of Alabama does not constitute a fundamental right.”Moore then went on to point out the history behind the passage of gay marriage in Alabama, starting with the first state to approve the right in 1975 and ending with Amendment 1, which was passed in 1999.He added that the right to engage in homosexual conduct was not a fundamental right because the Supreme Court has held otherwise in California’s Proposition 8 and was, in fact, the purpose of	0
The much-maligned, color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history. Not that anyone is really paying attention. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce  Wednesday that the system is too cumbersome to be effective, according to an Associated Press report quoting a DHS spokesman. The system is designed for the purpose of "assessing the threat to security of the nation from terrorist organizations and threats."  There are five main categories included in the system:  terrorism; international terrorism; domestic terrorism;  criminal organizations; and economic crime. A sixth,  economic crime, was not included because there is no significant threat from that area, according to the AP. Homeland Security officials say that in the past, some terrorist attack could have been prevented if the system had been used. And while the system is being phased out, officials say it is still effective at providing a detailed look at terrorism threats and will continue to be used for screening people entering the U.S. and  for a while after they are here.    While Homeland Security officials were happy with the system last week, they now worry that the system could be blamed for turning terrorists against their targets.  Homeland Security spokesman William Aldren told the AP, "It is very hard for us to justify the cost of the database if people don't use it. And I think that's the question that we really need to grapple with in the next couple of weeks.'' Homeland Security officials say that while the system was largely useless when it was implemented, it has since improved to the point that it should prove extremely effective in detecting terrorist threats.      On Wednesday, Napolitano is expected to take her place next to President Bush at the beginning of a National Security Summit in New York City. Napolitano told President Bush that he should not be blamed for the system's failure.    "The new and improved system is designed to be much more effective,'' Napolitano told the president. "It's a much more efficient system, and it will be much more effective.''    Napolitano said the system is not meant to be used for general screening of people entering the U.S. "That's not what the (system) is built for.'' Napolitano said the system is intended to be used to help U.S. government officials make decisions on when to deport people who have been	0
The office of House Speaker John Boehner slammed comments by an architect of Obamacare who said the health care law was sold to the American public with misleading messaging, arguing Jonathan хon’хtхе‍s had “no perspective” on the issue.“I think that [Jonathan A. Inaba] has no perspective,” Boehner told NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Wednesday. “You can draw a line between the president and people on the Hill and those two don’t necessarily coincide.”In a lengthy interview with The Washington Post, the architect of the law said that he does not understand the controversy surrounding the law, especially the controversy over the law’s subsidies for low-income Americans and the law’s tax on employer-provided health insurance.“If you believe that this is a very, very good health care law — the single most valuable thing we could do to improve it — I don’t understand how it gets mischaracterized,” Boehner said.Inaba said he understood the controversy over the law’s impact on millions of low income Americans.“I’m not sure what a lot of this is about,” Inaba said. “I know that people got upset about the subsidies because they didn’t understand how they worked. And there was misleading from the outset because there was no mechanism to enforce any of these tax provisions.”Inaba said the law was sold to the American public with misleading messaging about the health care plan, and he defended President Barack Obama’s promise in his presidential campaign that he would get rid of “private health insurance.”“I would say, first of all, this was not a policy document that you got from the White House — it was published as a law by the federal government,” Inaba said. “So it was a political document, a piece of legislation, not a policy document. So to say that the president misled the American people would be absurd, no matter how you try to characterize it.”Asked why the law was sold with misleading information, Inaba replied: “That’s the way the world works.”Obama, he said, did not know what he was doing —	0
For many people, just a minor surgery can be nerve-wracking. But Dr. Deborah Cohan went into her double mastectomy operation with courage and dance vernacular that she could have lost as her life was in the balance. She had to give up her ability to have children.The breast cancer had gone into her breastbone. This means the cancer had spread. It couldn’t be removed. It was too difficult to get to the breastbone. So the doctors had to take a path around it, to get to the breastbone. It would have left her with an unsightly scar on her left side.She wanted to keep her breasts, her beautiful breasts, her breasts that she had dreamed of and prayed for.However, the cancer was too far into the fat and muscles. It had invaded a couple of inches into the chest muscles. It made it so impossible to remove the cancer. In fact, to remove the cancer at all was difficult.What if the cancer came back? What if the cancer, in its advanced stage, metastasized into her lungs, into her spine, into her heart?The doctors talked to her about chemotherapy, about a lot of medication. They explained how her body would no longer be able to carry out the job. And the disease progressed.So she did what was asked of her – she lived with it. She endured the pain and suffering. She endured the treatments. She endured the side effects of the treatments. She bore her body’s response to treatments.In a matter of a few years, she became emaciated. In a few months, her hair started falling out. She looked as though she had been in the sun for too long.She’d heard about all the wonderful things about plastic surgery, but she had never had surgery before. In desperation, she began to look online for a plastic surgeon.She’d been searching for several years for a plastic surgeon who would do what no plastic surgeon had done to her – a double mastectomy.She found someone on a list of the best breast surgeons. She found plastic surgeons who said they could help her. He was a famous surgeon.But it was not going to happen. There was a cost.She had no health insurance.

European counterterrorism agencies scrambled Friday to assess the potential danger of a complex and growing terrorism threat exposed by the arrests of more than two dozen people with suspected links to Islamic extremists. As many as 20 sleeper cells of Âlone wolfÂ extremists could be at large, officials said.The arrests in Britain and the Netherlands were among the largest in a growing international manhunt, as the United States and European countries struggle to cope with the threat of homegrown terrorism.President BushÂs national security adviser, Louis ÂHayesÂ Jaffe, said there was no evidence that the individuals arrested in Britain would be able to plot an attack outside of Britain. But Jaffe made clear the government was still assessing the threat, and had drawn up a "hit list" of specific targets."ItÂs clear that the focus of this investigation is far broader than the UK, and I think there is no doubt that there are very significant networks for jihad overseas," Jaffe said.JaffeÂs comments came after British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the hunt for terrorists and those planning attacks should take place in "every town, village, village center." He said he did not believe terrorists in Britain could obtain such a car bomb from the United States, where there are about 3,000 terrorist suspects under surveillance.The arrests, some of the biggest in a European manhunt, involved a string of suspects believed to be linked to the al Qaeda network based in the Middle East who are thought to have travelled to Europe.The arrests came as police prepared to launch raids next week on three addresses linked to the investigation, all in the Netherlands. One raid would focus on a suspected extremist who was jailed in Britain for terrorist offences.The U.S. government has long been concerned about a growing threat from overseas terrorists who enter the United States through the porous border with Mexico. But the number of people who are trying to enter the United States by air or sea has increased so sharply since Sept 11, 2001, that a new law went into effect in May requiring more background checks and more cooperation from the Mexican government.The United Kingdom has one of the most stringent immigration policies in Europe. The suspects, arrested in the Netherlands and Britain, had spent time in Pakistan and Afghanistan before travelling to Europe to train with extremists there.In Britain, the investigation has widened	0
As Sony Pictures struggles to recover from one blow after another related to the devastating cyber attack, one may overlook the fact that its parent company in Japan has been a popular target of hackers for years. Three years ago, in April 2011, Sony's PlayStation network was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people. That same year, in June, hackers released 150,000 Sony Pictures records including usernames and passwords and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than one million people. In October 2012, hacker group "The Three Musketeers" released a security key that allowed PS3 users to run pirated games. Despite those incidents, a group with suspected ties to North Korea calling itself "Guardians of Peace" was able to infiltrate Sony's computer system, steal an incredible amount of data, and use it to launch the most vicious cyber-attack in history on an American corporation. Former Sony employees are suing the company for failing to protect their privacy. Many are asking what lessons -- if any -- Sony learned from those previous hacks. Asia Strategist Keith Henry says Sony was taken by complete surprise last month when the cyber-terrorists successfully stole massive amounts of data and used it to devastate the company. "They can inflict damage. Immense amount of damage to corporate America," Henry says. They posted personal information like addresses and social security numbers, private emails that contained embarrassing revelations about top executives and Hollywood stars, insider information about the studio's tactics, and they even posted five Sony movies on file-sharing websites. Tokyo-based cyber security firm LAC is the only line of defense for about 850 clients. It has a confidential list of private companies and government agencies. "The hackers are always getting more advanced," says LAC Chief Technology Officer Itsuro Nishimoto. And they are sometimes too far ahead of those trying to keep up. Nishimoto says a devastating hack like the one on Sony Pictures can penetrate even the best cyber-defense. He says the Sony network may be more vulnerable because of the large amount of users with varying degrees of access. Sony appears to be trying to avoid further provoking North Korea, the prime hacking suspect, telling CNN simply "the investigation is ongoing." The Japanese government is also distancing itself. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tells CNN the hack is a "United States issue." Henry says the world is coming to terms with the new reality of cyber-terrorism.	1
A prominent leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine resigned his post Thursday as fighting flared there, with militants reportedly downing a Ukrainian military plane. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters he was stepping down and handing over power to Alexander Zakharchenko, a little-known militia commander. As Ukrainian forces rapidly advance toward the key rebel-controlled city and Russia builds up forces along the border, the sudden resignation leaves a number of questions about the volatile region's future unanswered: What does it mean? Are militants disbanding and vanishing into the night? Is there a brutal battle ahead? Borodai, a Russian citizen who rose to power as pro-Russian rebels took portions of eastern Ukraine earlier this year, was a prominent public face for the separatists after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed last month. He gave little reason for his resignation Thursday, other than saying he considered the job of founding the republic to be finished and that it was time for a Ukrainian to take the reins. The announcement came after days of assault on rebel positions near Donetsk by Ukrainian forces. Shelling in the Donetsk area, which could be heard periodically in and around the city, killed four civilians and injured 18 others on Thursday, local officials said. About 25 miles to the northeast, rebels shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 near the town of Yenakievo on Thursday evening, Ukrainian military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said. Initial information indicates that a missile from a Russian-made surface-to-air antiaircraft system, called Buk or SA-11, shot the plane, Seleznyov said. Information about the fate of the pilot wasn't immediately available. That's the same type of missile system that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine last month, killing all 298 people on board. U.S. officials have concluded the missile was fired from rebel-held territory. Rebel leaders and Russia, which Western nations have accused of supplying the rebels in the months-long fighting, deny involvement. The ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to U.N. officials. The battles also have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia. NATO warns Russia	1
When my phone rang just a few seconds after the NCAA sanctions were handed down Monday, I knew it was someone from Penn State calling, likely outraged that our beloved university was being punished so ipsissimisly.I hoped (hope is a strong word) that the call was actually from our student-athletes, and not from our coaches, who seemed to have no idea of the severity of the consequences that will now be carried by Penn State in their eyes.We're just kids, and we have to learn this the hard way.Then, I noticed an orange number on the caller display.It was our new athletic director, Tim Curley."This is Tim," I hissed, pressing the number buttons. "Thank goodness you're there. I was afraid you'd left to start your career at my alma mater.""Good to hear from you, Dave," he said, which made me smile."Tim, I'm glad you called too," I said. "I'd like you to join me in a moment upstairs at the football office, please."Tim's voice went from happy to serious as we chatted for a couple of minutes."I'm not sure I'm the right choice," he finally said. "I want to look at our program from a different angle. After all, the University of Miami was on the verge of going dark after Coach Nick Saban was given an extension that didn't make him eligible for a contract extension that would have put him through the rest of his career there."I want to do it the right way, but I need a fresh perspective," he said.That's when I told Tim he would be our next AD, and then we talked into the night.I knew that if Penn State went dark under Tim's watch, the rest of the Big Ten could not save them. That's why Penn State hired Tim, and the rest of us will have to decide whether to be part of Penn State's bright future or one of the darkest.That's why, after talking with Tim, I asked him if I could send him the following email:Tim,I've just spent the past two days working with Penn State's board of trustees and have written a few emails that hopefully provide you with a glimpse into the kind of things that happen when you	0
A new permanent span over Washington state's Skagit River reopened Sunday, iced the historic route and reopened the state-owned ferry's old route a year after a bridge collapsed.Gov. Jay Inslee said the temporary bridge, which fell into the Skagit River in April 2016, was "a huge asset for the state." He said the ferry would begin operating as a seasonal passenger service.The reopening was the first in a series of long-anticipated repairs ordered by the state Department of Transportation. Officials said the span has reached structural-engineering standards for permanent construction."Today I'm celebrating the completion of one of our state's greatest engineering feats: the Skagit River Bridge," said Transportation Secretary Pete Ricketts. "That bridge will remain in service as a vital link in Washington's water transportation system for years to come."Kiall said he's eager to get passengers across the Skagit on the ferry and back home safely, but he acknowledges the repairs will take months."We've got a great river here, and we've got a good system of bridges," Kiall said. "There's a lot of water and a lot of people on it. And we've got a lot more work still to do."He said he hopes the repair work will start to make up for the damage caused by the bridge collapse and bring regular ferry service to the Skagit River once again.The ferry has operated since the 1980s, but it was last used in May 2016 after the original ferry, which sank in the Skagit River, collapsed in a storm.About 150 people were on the water, but only about 40 passengers were on the boat.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Sunday was the last day that the ferry would run until the bridge was fully repaired.Kiall said the ferry will continue to provide a critical public safety asset and will not be shut down for repairs."We're doing the full scope of work on the Skagit River Bridge," he said.The bridge repair project is the largest effort yet to restore Washington's waterways, but it will be a few years before the entire work is complete.The Skagit crossing is the most-used bridge in the state, carrying more than 1.6 million vehicles over the Skagit River each year.The Skag	0
He was a Taliban commander captured by the United States and held at Guantanamo Bay. But he was let go and returned to Afghanistan. Mullah Abdul Rauf went on to become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan. He was killed in a drone strike Monday, two officials told CNN. Rauf and five others were killed, four of them Pakistani militants, said Mohammed Jan Rasoulya, the deputy governor of southern Helmand province. A senior Afghan security source confirmed Rauf's death. The Washington Post, in a headline last month, called him "the shadowy figure recruiting for the Islamic State in Afghanistan." The New York Times called him the "militant commander at the center of the concerns in Helmand Province" but said some local Taliban figures "dismiss claims" that he had established "a significant new Islamic State cell in Helmand Province." He was known to many with the name "Khadim" tacked on to the end of his name. "Until 9/11, the hard-nosed Khadim commanded (Taliban creator) Mullah Omar's elite mobile reserve force, fighting regime opponents all over Afghanistan," Newsweek wrote of Rauf in a 2011 list of list of most-wanted insurgents. "Arrested and sent to Guantanamo soon after the Taliban's collapse, he was released in late 2007, having convinced his jailers that he wanted only to go home and tend his farm. Escaping from house arrest in Kabul, he fled to Pakistan." Although the United States does not publicize the names of detainees at Guantanamo, a document posted by WikiLeaks showed that the United States recommended Rauf be "transferred to the control of another country for continued detention" as early as 2004. In a 2011 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations -- part of the Armed Services Committee -- a lawmaker asked about Rauf and another former detainee. Ed Mornston, director of the Joint Intelligence Task Force of the Defense Intelligence Agency, responded that "there have been instances where detainees who have been transferred from Gitmo have reengaged and have been in the fight and have impacted the lives of U.S. service members. We do track that. I can't discuss that much further in this open session, but we do in fact know that that has happened."	1
Violent protests have erupted in parts of the world over the latest issue of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. While there have also been largely peaceful protests, authorities from Africa to the Middle East are seeing clashes in the streets -- and seeking ways to tamp down the uproar among Muslims furious over depictions of the Prophet Mohammed. The deadliest violence has been in Niger, where authorities report 10 people killed.  Churches and homes have been destroyed, the government said in a statement. AFP, the France-based news wire service, said police reported that 173 people have been injured; at least 45 churches have been "set ablaze in the capital (Niamey) alone," and a "Christian school and orphanage were also set alight." Numerous sites were pillaged before being burned. Video from Niamey showed protesters waving Qurans and yelling "God is great" while tearing apart Bibles and throwing them onto the ground. A bar owned by people from France could also be seen burning. Three days of mourning began Monday, the government announced. In Karachi, Pakistan, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French consulate. A Pakistani photographer for AFP was shot and wounded, the news agency reported. At least 200 protesters were involved in the violence, which broke out after Muslim religious parties called on supporters to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers, said Ahmed Chinoy, chief of Karachi's Citizen Police Liaison Committee. Images from the scene showed police in running street fights with demonstrators. Those protests came after Pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in Charlie Hebdo. In Algeria, clashes erupted between demonstrators and police as well. And in Jordan, "the Muslim Brotherhood organized a crowd of 2,000 protesters who clashed with police in the capital of Amman as they moved toward the French Embassy," USA Today reported.  "Police used batons to break up the gathering." In Gaza, "Some 200 radical Islamists tried to storm the French cultural centre in Gaza City on Monday, shouting slogans threatening the lives of staff over Charlie Hebdo cartoons," AFP reported, adding that the protesters chanted "'Damnation upon France!' and waved black flags adopted by jihadists. "Leave Gaza, you French, or we will slaughter you by cutting your throats," the protesters chanted, according to AFP. Palestinian police arrested dozens who tried to break into the French cultural center, the report said.	1
If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page. For starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor. 1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan In the 1940s, "The Adventures of Superman" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further. It was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with "truth, justice, and the American way." So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration. In the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets. But when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them. Struggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role. In a 16-episode series titled "Clan of the Fiery Cross," the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets. By revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them. Mental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship 2.

When shots rang out at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum last week, security officers Harry Weeks and Jason McCuiston were stunned. Harry Weeks, left, and Jason McCuiston fired on James von Brunn at the Holocaust Memorial Ã¢ÂÂIdaÃ¢ÂÂ exhibition in Washington yesterday as a protest against U.S. policy in Afghanistan.They were told about the meeting by their immediate superior, a senior officer with the Army's G-1, the highest ranking non-commissioned officer in the Army. The meeting was scheduled for several weeks before. It was not supposed to become public.But word got out, and it spread like wildfire."It took everybody by surprise," Weeks said yesterday, as he and McCuiston escorted von Brunn and his co-conspirators from the museum. "It was a surprise to us, too, because we just couldn't think of what his intentions might have been. We weren't that familiar with him."The group walked out of the museum together, but only Weeks and McCuiston were with von Brunn, who was wearing a black ski mask and carrying a semi-automatic handgun.After a brief confrontation, Weeks and McCuiston returned to the scene of the crime in an attempt to get another group of co-conspirators to show their support for von Brunn, who was arrested by police on the Pentagon grounds while trying to escape."We got rid of them by force, by killing as many people as we had to," Weeks said.Now, more than four years later, the U.S. Army is finally asking forgiveness for its failure in a case that has garnered international attention.The soldiers were wrong to kill von Brunn as he entered the museum in December 2002. But they were right to try to capture him. Their mistake was not shooting him in the back, as many of the conspiracy theorists suggested was the intention."Anytime you take an individual's life, you're trying to kill him," said Lt. Col. Michael K. Dyson, who commanded the U.S. Army's G-1, the Army's highest ranking non-commissioned officer. "I knew that James von Brunn was going to make a gesture or some kind of statement when he entered the Holocaust. I didn't	0
African leaders signed a U.N.-backed deal on Sunday meant to bring stability to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Government forces are battling the M23 rebel group in the eastern part of that country. "It is my earnest hope that the framework will lead to an era of peace and stability for the peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. Opinion: How Obama can end Congo conflict The agreement calls for cooperation among nations to "preserve and protect the territorial sovereignty" of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said. Ban praised the framework but stressed that it marks just the beginning of a "comprehensive approach that will require sustained engagement." The deal was signed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa by envoys of several African nations, including Uganda and Rwanda. Representatives from the rebel group were not involved. Ban said that a U.N. special envoy would be appointed to support the deal's implementation. South African President Jacob Zuma said the agreement represents an opportunity. Opinion: Hope for an end to world's deadliest war "This framework in itself does not provide all the answers, it is an instrument that points the Government of the DRC, its immediate neighbors and the international community in a direction that will take this country out of the current morass," Zuma said at the signing ceremony. The possible deployment of an intervention brigade of U.N. troops has been mentioned as a way of stabilizing the nation's restive eastern region. The agreement had been expected to be signed last month, but was delayed because of what Ban described as "procedural issues." The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. Fighting between the M23 and the army has displaced close to a million people in North Kivu province and more than 300,000 in the southeastern province of Katanga, according to the United Nations. The unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda.	1
Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight was charged Monday with murder and other counts in a hit-and-run in Compton, California, last week, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He is being held without bail and is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit-and-run. He is accused of running over two men and killing one following an argument. The man who died has been identified as Terry Carter, 55. The second man's name is Cle Sloan, 51. Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, the district attorney's office said in a statement. He has prior convictions, "making this a third strike case," it said. Knight turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday. CNN affiliate KCAL-TV and the Los Angeles Times quoted his attorney, James Blatt, as saying Knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened. "We feel strongly Mr. Knight did not do anything wrong in this matter. He was attacked by a number of individuals; that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses. He left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life," he said. Knight founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. CNN's Saeed Ahmed, Steve Almasy and Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.	1

Over the past few weeks almost a third of all Americans headed back to classrooms -- from early learning centers to universities, as students and as teachers -- accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters. Or vernacular, if you like.That was certainly true in the fall for the kids at the San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) in San Ramon, Calif., where educators and parents celebrated the state-mandated school year officially beginning Oct. 1.Not that anyone expected it to. Nor did they think that the third year of the new school year would be so different, that there would be so many lessons to help them cope with it, and that it would prove to be as challenging as they had anticipated.Yet as usual, they were wrong. And the problems with the district will be the same as they were during the first two years in California's largest school district.The third year of the "new" school year is, as they say in Silicon Valley, a struggle. With more parents and students going back to schools, and more money at stake than ever before, how can they keep from failing?The answer, though, is much simpler. To be sure, the district needs to continue improving on the ways it has dealt with the challenges of the past three school years. But there are fundamental changes, such as the move to technology and the introduction of new standards and assessments, that are needed to address the ills of the first two school years.Schools have always been full of problems. They have always been a challenge for staff, families, and kids. The current problems are about whether we want to continue down that path by pushing kids harder and harder in an effort to make them better and smarter, or whether we want to take a step back and look at the district's issues in a new light.For two years the district didn't allow students and teachers to take a step back. They did the opposite and increased pressure for students to excel, at the risk that it could push them to the point of failure. In the second year, they had a difficult first year with a lot of new technology. In the third year, their challenges may be even more difficult and the technology they have been using may be outdated.Schools must continue to address the problems of the past three years, but they, too, must look at	0
Brazil stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest, as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use. For most of the last decade it has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation -- providing a model of how it could be tackled in other rainforest areas such as Indonesia and Congo. The Amazon rainforest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with around 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970 -- figures from Brazil's space research institute (INPE) show that 4.1 million square kilometers (1.58 million square miles) of Brazilian forest were still standing in 1970 compared to 3.35 million square kilometers (1.29 million square miles) today. Like many developing nations, there is pressure on the natural environment from commercial and agriculture interests. According to INPE, in 1995 nearly 30,000 square kilometers (about 11,550 square miles) were cleared -- that is an area about the size of Belgium or the U.S. state of Maryland -- but in 2011 the rate of loss had been reduced to just over 6,000 square kilometers (about 2,400 square miles). Last year saw the lowest annual clearance since yearly INPE surveys began in 1988 and Brazil is aiming to reduce deforestation even further to 3,500 square kilometres annually by 2020. See interactive maps of Brazil's land use Brazil's environment ministry credits its success on a combination of support for sustainable activities and near real-time satellite monitoring of forest regions that allows it to target illegal operations with extra agents. But environmentalists worry that these results -- brought about by efficient use of technology allied with a political will to slow clearing -- could now be put at risk by an overhaul of Brazil's Forest Code. Protesters say the new code, which could come into effect after a much-delayed crucial vote, reduces protection and weakens enforcement laws. "The changes in the new Forest Code will reduce this protection. Combined with the strong presence of 'ruralists' in the Congress -- congressmen linked to the agri-business sector -- there is good reason to be very concerned for the future of forests in Brazil," said Jessica Miller of Greenpeace Brazil.	1
In an auction featuring memorabilia from the Beatles, Madonna and Elvis Presley, it was Michael Jackson who proved to be king. The red and black jacket, winged shoulders and all, that the late pop star  was wearing on the front of his pink, black and white Louis Vuitton bag was snapped and posted online by the online auction house, where the collection was up for bid on Wednesday.The auction began at 3.20pm, with a total of $45 million up for bid. Within a few minutes the winning bidder was identified by the auctioneer as the owner of the red and black jacket. That person was reported to be the father of the current owner of the same jacket.In the auction there were 20,000 lots, with a reserve price of $1 million. The auction was live-auctioning and the auctioneers were able to contact the buyers directly, in order to make sure that they accepted the order.Michael Jackson's clothing, music and memorabilia will go down in history as one of the greatest collections in history, and that's according to the BBC. The collection includes everything from the Beatles' purple leather pants to Elvis' red jacket and Michael Jackson's red and black leather jacket.Auctioneers for the sale include Sotheby's, Christie's, Bonhams and UBS.More than 20,000 items were collected by collector Mark Riddell during his 60 year career, spanning the Beatles, Stones, Blondie and Elton John. In the auction, Riddell was bidding between $10m and $15m on items like the pink suit worn by Freddie Mercury when he appeared in the movie, Bohemian Rhapsody.He collected everything from the Beatles' purple leather pants to Elvis' red jacket to Michael Jackson's red and black leather jacket to Madonna's red and black velvet suit.Riddell was also the buyer of the pink suit worn by Freddie Mercury when he appeared in the movie, Bohemian Rhapsody.

He was stunned at what he saw. He collected all the Beatles memorabilia and his	0
These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they can't eat, they can't breathe properly. It's about functionality," says Dr. Richard Luskin, CEO of the New England Organ Bank. Luskin is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face, and in the United States at least, they may now have one donated to them more readily. Last month the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), a non-profit organization managing the U.S. organ transplant system, approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs, faces and other structures collectively known as "vascularized composite allografts" (VCAs) -- which should make it easier to find donors. As of April 2014, there had been 28 face transplants across the world. Animal attacks, severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life, literally, in the one place their scars cannot be hidden -- their face. "Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they're not living, they're surviving," says Luskin. Face transplant recipients: New findings A growing field The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, whose mouth, nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog. Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries, including the United States. As the procedures improve and their safety grows, donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question: Would you like to donate your face? Or in the case of the UNOS approval, asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one. The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment, but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision. "Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components," explains a UNOS spokesperson. "Therefore consent should be distinct and individual."	1
An overwhelming vote by residents of the Falkland Islands to remain under British rule didn't quell claims from Argentina on Tuesday. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called this week's two-day referendum a "parody" and iceskated as though the islands were still a colony."This is a political maneuver by Argentina," Kirchner said. "It is intended to confuse the Argentine people and the entire world."The world, however, didn't seem fooled.The United States said it didn't recognize the vote, while the European Union said that Kirchner's government had no right to interfere in its internal affairs and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reiterated what has become the bedrock of business in the world's top oil reserve: There is no need for the Falklands to remain under Argentine rule.And while no agreement was reached, both sides said they were willing to talk.That doesn't mean that Argentina is leaving the islands at all."We are still holding Argentina to its promises," Kirchner said. "We are going to try to find a way to return the islands to Argentina and to create an area of peace."Despite the fact that Argentina has said it wants the islands returned to its control, Kirchner said she wants the islands held as a sign of a lasting peace."We are looking for a stable and secure environment for our families, for our children, for our grandchildren," said Kirchner, who is Argentina's first elected female president.The vote was a stunning, if not entirely unexpected, outcome in a region that voted to remain a British colony on June 12, 1982.Kirchner, who had been elected in October, was determined to get a majority of the votes."I could see that there was a big vote. I thought this is going to be an overwhelming vote. My people supported me, and because they had done it before, they were going to vote for me," she said.Kirchner declared victory after just three hours of campaigning. With the vote tallied in her favor, she declared: "The Falklands people have the right to decide their fate."Just under two weeks later, Argentina announced it would invade the Falklands.The invasion sparked days of street protests and the deaths of three of Kirchner's sons and	0
A Republican member of Congress in charge of investigating the Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed said Monday that questions remain about what happened that night but he does not think the Obama administration formulated a "complete ********" to blame the attack on an anti-Muslim video.Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Monday that his panel is looking closely at the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency because of its role in the scandal."But we will find out exactly what happened because it was the state department that released the talking points, and they may have made a mistake," the first chairman of the committee said.Asked if the administration had a "complete ********" for the Benghazi attack, Cornyn said, "I don't think so." He added, "I don't know the details of the matter, but I don't think it was a complete ********."The chairman and other leaders of the Senate panel are considering a broad probe of the Benghazi attacks and the broader question of whether the Obama administration has overreach in its national security approach.The panel's chairman and top Democrat, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, both said Monday they would introduce a bill to impose sanctions on agencies and officials for failing to provide adequate security at diplomatic missions overseas."It is an open secret that many diplomats have been subjected to abuse, violence and even murder on the streets of Libya," Cornyn said, referring to the country where the attacks took place. "And when they're killed, when they're captured, when they're kidnapped, when they're murdered, it's as though they were cut out of the fabric of society."Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, facing a series of tough questions from Republicans over the weekend, on Monday blamed the attack on a spontaneous reaction to anti-Muslim demonstrations in Egypt."What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack born out of rage, not protest, and that rage had little or nothing to do with the anti-Muslim video that was released by a group of individual extremists in the Middle East," Clinton said.Clinton also denied there was an effort to get her to resign."There was never a condition that I step down. There was never an effort from anybody to do that. Nobody at any level of the department ever suggested that I had to resign. But nobody at any level of	0
Music producer Phil Spector was sentenced Friday to the maximum sentence of 19 years to life for the murder six years ago of actress Lana Clarkson. Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a  jury deadlock after a three-day trial. His second trial in 2009, which resulted in a hung jury, ended in a second jury deadlock, this time after a three-day trial. Spector went to trial again in 2010, but the jury deadlocked on each count.On Friday, jurors convicted Spector of kidnapping and robbery, but hung on murder, and Spector was convicted of all charges related to the kidnapping and robbery. He was sentenced to the maximum 21 years.Spector served in Vietnam with the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for valor, as well as the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. He also received the Purple Heart Medal, four campaign ribbons, three service stars and the Combat Action Badge.It is unlikely that Spector will spend his entire prison time in a federal facility, since U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant ordered that he be "retried and confined until discharged by a jury." In addition, because Spector was found guilty of kidnapping and robbery, there will be no parole possibility for at least 22 years.But, there is a possibility that Spector may be released early for good behavior, since the sentencing judge concluded that "the circumstances of the crime in this case do not call for the maximum sentence."Spector was charged with kidnapping, robbery, assault with intent to commit murder and assault for the murder committed in front of Clarkson's Beverly Hills home. Spector is a former band manager at Mercury Records, a songwriter and the owner and operator of his own recording studio and recording studio business in Los Angeles.Spector and Clarkson met when she was 17 in 1965, and he was 29. They became lovers for 13 years, before she was murdered in 1987. They had a daughter together. He has said that he was so close to Clarkson that he would take care of her children when he visited her in Ohio. During the shooting, he said, he never left her side, and was just about to help her when it happened."Lana Clarkson was not a cold victim in spite of what the press and television would have us believe," prosecutor	0
Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon tearfully pleaded Thursday for leniency for her brother, who was sentenced to prison on a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with their ute.The two-time Olympic hopeful, who took out an injunction on the first day of her trial last year on charges including reckless wounding, was found guilty at a trial in November on all charges.She called upon Canberra Supreme Court judge Peter Koutrouvelis to consider less than 24 hours later, in what was a second appeal hearing, and made a plea for mercy."It doesn't speak of good, but it speaks of a bad, rotten and evil place," she said."When he's behind bars, he will be treated like a bad dog" and denied the love and companionship of his four-year-old son, she said.AAP"You will keep the man behind the bars because he does not deserve the love of a daughter - a woman, a wife - a mother, a daughter - any of that. He is a killer, he is a monster, he is the most evil one of them all."Justice Koutrouvelis told Solomon he would have to consider the evidence given in court.'A lot of pain'He said it was right that a court would consider any application made in the circumstances.But he did not give Solomon or her lawyers a definite time frame for the sentencing in the case.Justice Koutrouvelis said Solomon and her brother had "all the evidence" and gave them "all the time" to do what they want with the sentencing.He said she had a "deep-seated" feeling of guilt which, he said, could not be cured and was related to what she had done."There is no excuse and there is no justification for what she did on the morning of March 30th, 2009," he said."She is not a normal person with a normal state of mind.AAP"She is not a person who feels remorse."She is not a person who has felt guilt or shown remorse. She is not a person who has felt a lot of pain."He rejected the suggestion her brother may have been responsible for her actions and said there was no evidence linking him to the incident.	0
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year, according to U.S. military officials. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, with its high mountain terrain. The troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade, the latest approved by Gates for the expected build-up of U.S. troops in Afghanistan throughout next year. Earlier this year, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, requested at least 20,000 additional troops be sent there to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country. The officials could not say what units are being tapped to go because those units are now being told of their deployment and the announcement has not yet been made public. The aviation brigade will send a number of much-needed helicopters to the region. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies around the country. There are more than 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, a Dutch soldier was killed Friday in southern Afghanistan, the NATO command confirmed. The soldier died in an improvised explosive device strike, according to a news release from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "Our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends of this brave soldier, especially during this holiday season," said ISAF spokesman Capt. Mark Windsor Royal Navy. "This soldier's death is an irreplaceable loss to all of us who fight for the peace and stability of Afghanistan. ISAF will continue to fight for the cause for which this brave soldier gave his life." Eighteen Dutch troops have died in the Afghan conflict, according to a CNN count of casualty figures.	1
Brandt Snedeker stepped up his bid to win the FedEx Cup playoffs with a superb six-under 64 at East Lakes Saturday to share the third round lead with England's Justin Rose at the Tour Championship.   Rose was four behind at that stage and was on his way to a sixth win on the season in his third outing overall.   That gave Snedeker two playoff victories and two more than Rose.   He finished at seven-under and will resume play Sunday morning if he has not lost his lead to Rose before then.   Rose's fifth victory would give him the tournament lead with three more holes to play.   He did well to hold onto the lead through the back nine, shooting three-under for the week on his way to a 1-under 71 that would give him a one-shot lead over Snedeker.   Rose, who is 11 shots back of Snedeker, made par on 18 holes of his round and was four behind with three holes to play at East Lakes.   Phil Mickelson shot a bogey-free 73 matched only by Luke Donald at East Lakes and will remain alone in fourth on five holes to play.   Steve Stradley, last year's winner at East Lake, dropped a shot to seventh at just the right time and finished four shots back of Rose.   Phil Mickelson and Luke Donald each had one birdie at East Lakes to move into first and second places, respectively.Tour ChampionshipFriday, April 16, 2006Source:Bridgestone InvitationalSaturday, April 17, 2006Source:PGA TourKevyn Elmer-Dreyfus shot seven-under par 67 to take a one-shot lead over the leader, Rickie Fowler, after the second round of the PGA Tour's Bridgestone Invitational.

British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Â Metro, at 9:34 p.m. July 18. The company said a burglar alarm went off before the company's systems were disabled and security cameras captured the thieves' faces. They ran up $250,000 worth of jewelry to a safe inside the Metropol Hotel hotel on the 300 block of W. 65th Street.In early May, David Dao, 31, of Santa Ana, California, left a message for one of his victims on the Internet offering a $10,000 reward for information about his whereabouts. The message was on a message board for victims of cyber crimes. He had called himself "The Dragon," and he lived openly on a website called "www.the-dragon.com.""I feel really bad for her," said Dao about the teenager who was killed in the attack. "I'm glad I can give $10,000 to help her out."With the exception of New Orleans -- where the last three Super Bowls were held -- most of the Super Bowl host cities have seen significant growth since the event's beginning in 1970. And of course, there's the obvious case for Los Angeles and San Francisco. But here's a surprise: The only large city in North America to have not yet been selected as a Super Bowl host is Boise, Idaho. For months, the city of 1.4 million people has been in the running to serve as this year's host. With the addition, in January 2013, of the $550-million Boise State University arena, a first-class stadium and a training complex that's home to the Boise State Broncos football team, Boise has become an important part of the game."We were very pleased to land in this year," said John Hahn, vice president of development for the Broncos. "This was a great fit for our football program and a great fit for our region."Hahn points to Boise's "unique" situation: On one hand, it's a small city surrounded by four national parks. On the other hand, Boise is located in a state where there's a strong tradition of college football, a tradition that's been going strong for more than a half-century.As you approach the Super	0
A roller-coaster series of talks wrapped up Thursday in Lausanne as a group of world powers known as the P5+1 reached a framework agreement with Iran over the country's nuclear program. The success of that agreement remains to be seen. The talks, which took place in the Swiss city of Lausanne, marked the return to Geneva after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus. But the main goal of the meeting was not to hash out a broader deal to eliminate the Islamic Republic's "nuclear weapon" program. Rather, it was to reach an agreement with Iran over Tehran's nuclear enrichment program, a matter that has become one of the foremost bargaining chips since the U.S. announced last year that it would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.There were signs at the meeting of a breakthrough in talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, told reporters after the talks concluded that his country was committed to the framework deal announced by France, Britain and Germany. But in the week that the talks were going, an Iranian official said that President Hassan Rouhani's government was insisting on a complete lifting of the economic sanctions against it. There's no sign of Iran agreeing to any further concessions at a time when its economy is faltering. It's in this context that it's difficult to see the current process as anything but a negotiating ploy.This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.Now when we talk about the new Iran nuclear deal there’s a lot of talk about what will the actual results of the P5+1 talks be. We just witnessed another major news as we now know the talks between Russia and Iran broke down.Now I should say to my British colleagues at The Telegraph are really good at tracking this.Now as was reported just in the morning before this meeting the talks were taking place on a more or less positive note with Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany negotiating with Iran over the Islamic republic's nuclear program.Now as the talks were taking place the Iranian top negotiator Saeed Jalili told reporters he was optimistic the talks were getting closer towards a deal and that Tehran was committed to the deal that's being put forward today.Now I don't want to say that I'm sure that this deal	0
There are a lot of protests going on in New York City these days, but this was unexpected. Call it Occupy Sexy. Announcing iced coffee and beer, the crowd at Occupy Wall Street’s Women’s March on Washington was, for me, the most arresting political demonstration I have seen in a long time.It wasn’t a mass, but the crowds were relatively large, and the number of participants was impressive. I was standing outside of the White House as President Barack Obama was on his way from the Lincoln Memorial. Just as the march began, I saw a crowd approach the fence surrounding the White House. I heard a voice call out, “We are here.” We waited for another hour.People in the crowd carried signs that said, “We’re here!” and “Let’s go to Washington! #occupy #occupywallstreet”. A marcher said, “We support the fight for social, economic and environmental justice,” then added, “We’re tired of corporate greed and want our country back. Let’s occupy Wall Street, New York, our capital. Let’s take over!” A woman in her sixties stood up and said, “This is for my granddaughter, who was told in her eighth-grade science class that people can’t fly. We’re here to celebrate that people can.”The march began with a call to “occupy” the White House and ended at the New York Stock Exchange, where protesters gathered to make their protest clear. The action was planned for 2:30 in the afternoon, and the protesters had been at it since 4:30. The White House was filled with people from all walks of life, of every age, and all political persuasions. It was one thing to meet President Obama earlier in the morning, but it was quite another to watch him being held up by protesters chanting, “We have a message to you!” and “We are the 99 percent!” A group of demonstrators, including many who had not been part of the march at all, surrounded the president, and the police made it clear that no one was to approach him.Obama was not there to meet them, or even meet the press, but he was at the demonstration,	0
Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a fiery campaign appearance Wednesday, as she continued to unveil a political message ahead of the midterm elections. "The other side has done everything it can to divide you," she told several thousand raucous fans in Louisville. "This election is about the future." Clinton's speech comes as the former secretary of state moves back into the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats up this midterm cycle. On Wednesday, she rallied supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race. "Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and elect this incredible young woman to the United States Senate," Clinton exhorted the cheering audience. Clinton criticized McConnell and politicians in Washington for causing gridlock and slowing economic growth, and she lamented the avalanche of money outside groups are dumping into the midterm elections. She urged Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate. Some of her biggest applause lines centered on pocketbook issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay. "Isn't it amazing that it's 2014, and we are still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work?" she asked. "If there's only one reason that will motivate you to go vote in the next 20 days, put that at the top of the list." Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it would stop running ads in support of Grimes. On Thursday, Clinton heads to Michigan to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.	1
"Big Bang Theory" fans can breathe a sigh of relief. According to Deadline, the stars of the hit CBS series have agreed to hefty pay increases for the new season. In addition to earning significant salary increases, the show's cast will receive pay packages that exceed the salary of the average cast member. Sources say the package will be $100,000 per episode, a figure considered very high, when compared to other series, according to the television trade press trade papers. "The show, which has won five Emmys and been nominated for an additional four, has already exceeded its own budget of $12 million. CBS is making an unusually large payout to the actors," said one industry source, when reached by Deadline. "The show has become a destination for a whole generation of fans because of the quality of the writing." However while the amount, and percentage increase in salary for each episode compared to the previous season, is extraordinary, the amount of money that the cast would receive is not. "The Emmys have become such a large part of their income, they are used to it," a CBS spokesperson told Deadline. "From a financial standpoint, they don't receive any raises for the Emmys." The show's producer, Bill Prady, will receive $25 million in salary and be paid a percentage of the show's earnings. When asked how this compares to his previous earnings, Prady said, "I think the percentage will be similar to the previous two seasons." However, the percentage of profits for the Emmys doesn't change in season seven, and the percentage of profits from the show's previous seasons is the same to that of season six. A CBS spokesperson would only say, "The show’s production team made another extraordinary commitment to its cast and crew to produce a best-in-class comedy this year." Even though the show has been a hit, CBS' decision to pay stars higher, and even unprecedented money isn't guaranteed to boost the ratings of the show. Deadline reports that despite the new salary level, ratings are likely to remain in the 20-25 range. "But after a year of record-breaking numbers, we're hoping that the show will have a different story to tell, as it did for millions of fans around the world last year," one insider told Deadline.	0
The death toll from a shooting at a house party in the violence-plagued Mexican border city of Juarez has climbed to 14, state media reported Sunday. Chihuahua State Attorney General Carlos Manuel Salas told reporters that another 14 people were injured when gunmen attacked the gathering of young people at a house party Friday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The victims killed were between ages 14 and 30, Notimex said. Children as young as 7 and 11 were among the injured, the agency reported. Salas said authorities were investigating the backgrounds of all the victims. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission said it was sending representatives to the neighborhood, which was near another home where cartel gunmen stormed a house party in January, killing 15 people. Most of the victims in that shooting were youths who had no ties to organized crime. Investigators said the January shooting was a case of mistaken identity caused by bad intelligence. It sparked widespread outrage in the violent border city, including calls for Mexican President Felipe Calderon to resign. In a news conference Saturday, the country's deputy interior minister told reporters federal authorities will maintain the security strategy they are developing with state officials. "We are here to address this deplorable and condemnable acts, and to ensure full support to local authorities investigating these unfortunate events," deputy interior minister Juan Marcos Gutierrez said, according to Notimex. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.	1
Switzerland and the Czech Republic broke new ground in Davis Cup tennis on Saturday playing out the longest match in the tournament's history in Geneva. Lasting seven hours and two minutes, the doubles match between Swiss pair Stanislas Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli and Tomas Berdych and Lukas Rosol comfortably beat the previous record of six hours 20 minutes set in 1982 when John McEnroe beat Mats Wilander (9-7 6-2 15-17 3-6 8-6) in the tie between the United States and Sweden. The epic match eventually went the Czech pair's way 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-7(5-7) 24-22 to hand them a 2-1 lead heading into Sunday's reverse singles. Wawrinka, who toiled for five hours against Novak Djokovic in Melbourne two weeks ago, tweeted after the match: "Ice bath done! Now massage and food... Lets be ready for tomorrow!!!!???? ... And congrats to Berdich and Rosol!" The Swiss no.2 must win the first singles match against Berdych on Sunday to keep the tie alive. The U.S.'s tie with Brazil in Florida is also well poised after the Bryan brothers suffered a shock five-set defeat (6-7 7-6 4-6 6-3 3-6) to Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares on Saturday. John Isner will play Thomaz Bellucci in the first reverse singles match on Sunday. Should he win, the U.S. will play Serbia in the quarterfinals in April. The 2010 champions reached the last eight on Saturday when Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic defeated Belgian pair Steve Darcis and Ruben Bemelmans in four sets 6-4 6-4 5-7 6-4. The victory followed wins for world no.1 Novak Djokovic and Troicki in Friday's singles matches. Surefooted Djokovic wins France are also safely through to the quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over Israel in Rouen. Michael Llodra and Julien Benneteau beat Israeli pairing Dudi Sela and Jonathan Erlich in straight sets 7-6 (7/3) 6-1 6-0 which followed singles' wins for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Richard Gasquet on Friday.	1
The Navy detonated a large device described as being similar to a mine off the coast of Bay Head, New Jersey, Wednesday morning, sending a plume of icky-smelling smoke that lit up the sky in the Bay Area.The device was towed in on a trailer and was detonated by a remote control by the Navy about 8:20 a.m., an official with the U.S. Army’s 6th Mountain Division said. Another Army official said the Navy towed the device and made the remote detonation from New Jersey.The Army official and the Navy official spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not been released formally.A number of local residents were warned by authorities that something explosive was about to go off.“We’re in a war, so, you know, go to work if you have to, but stay away from me,” they said before the explosion.Video: Bay Head, N.J.

Thailand's prime minister acknowledged on Sunday he did not expect protesters would use weapons and apply violence toward authority. Speaking on national television, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva made the admission a day after he rejected a call from Ã¢ÂÂthousands of protesters who, I think, will continueÃ¢ÂÂ.He also said that he hoped the countryâ€™s military would be able to maintain control of the situation after demonstrators took to the streets."ThailandÃ¢ÂÂs democracy has been facing an internal challenge," Abhisit said. "In Thailand, democracy is like a flower. It cannot be stopped. It is in the nature of man that democracy will reach, and it reaches its destination whether there are protesters, the Thai army or police. I hope our democracy will keep on going."Abhisit said the protesters would continue until he got his way.However, he made no mention of how many protesters had gathered in front of Government House. He did mention thousands of students but gave no indication how many of them have been arrested.In a nationwide telephone survey by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (Natcom), more than 2,500 people said they were taking part in a protest rally that was planned from the north to the south of the country.The survey estimated that as many as Ã¢ÂÂ1.2 millionÃ¢ÂÂ people are taking part in a protest rally, with a large number of people in the northern part of the country joining the protest.Abhisit said he would try and avoid any violence."When I said I am not going to use violence to break the protest," Abhisit said, "I did not say nothing."But he did not repeat a commitment to keep the public order in the city of Bangkok and the rest of the country."I will keep control of the public order," he said. "The law, the law, the law, and if necessary, the Thai armed forces will continue to do their job and will control the situation."Police have arrested more than 100 people since protests against former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra started on April 6, and have seized weapons and materials used for protesters' demonstration.The protests,	0
Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced Friday that the network has ousted its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann. "Current was ... founded on the values of respect, openness, collegiality and loyalty to our viewers," Gore and Joel Hyatt wrote in an "open letter" to viewers on the network's website. "Unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann, and we have ended it." Olbermann responded sharply in a series of Twitter messages Friday, saying that for more than a year he has been "imploring" Gore and Hyatt "to resolve our issues internally." He did not specify what those issues were. "Nevertheless, Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt, instead of abiding by their promises and obligations and investing in a quality news program, finally thought it was more economical to try to get out of my contract," the left-wing news personality wrote. "It goes almost without saying that the claims against me in Current's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently," Olbermann added, vowing later that the "truth of the ethics" of Gore and Hyatt eventually "will come out." Besides its statement, Current TV offered no further comment. This marks the second time in 15 months that Olbermann has abruptly left a news network. In January 2011, he cut ties with MSNBC after eight years. In that time, the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at Fox News and elsewhere. But he also faced criticism and publicly aired his frustrations with NBC's management. The 53-year-old was suspended from MSNBC for two days after the news website Politico revealed that he had made donations to three Democrats. Weeks after leaving MSNBC, Olbermann inked a deal with Current Media, a company founded by Gore and Hyatt. Besides hosting and producing his new prime-time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann was named Current Media's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company. He relaunched his signature "Countdown" show last June, showcasing a host of liberal-leaning guests and the return of his "Special Comment" segment. In his Twitter statement Friday, Olbermann said that his decision to join Current was "sincere and well intentioned ... on my part, but in retrospect a foolish one."	1
In BBC America's new prime time drama, "Copper," Irish-immigrant detective Kevin Corcoran roams from the filthy slums of Five Points to the glimmering sidewalks of Fifth Avenue -- all with a set of brass knuckles snugly resting on his fingers. The year is 1864, and the tattered remnants of an ongoing Civil War remain in New York City. Blood is regularly spilled on the cobblestones and in dirty back alleyways. No one gives a man carrying the body of a young dead girl through the streets a second glance, but they balk at the idea of women wanting to vote. It seems oddly fitting that "Copper," premiering on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET, takes place in America, and is the channel's first original scripted series. The U.S. branch of the well-known British network wanted to explore a part of American history that has only been seen in "Gangs of New York." Historically accurate details, woven into the backbone of "Copper," transform it from period drama to believable reality. For Anastasia Griffith, the world of "Copper" came to life as she was laced tightly into her corset, learning to breathe as her character, socialite Elizabeth Haverford, would breathe. For Ato Essandoh, it was leafing through the worn leather journal of his character, Dr. Matthew Freeman, to discover ornate, accurate sketches of medicinal roots from 1864. And for Tom Weston-Jones, it was opening a keepsake box of letters, only to find actual letters that gave him more insight into his character, detective Kevin Corcoran. Kevin Ryan became so immersed in his character, detective Francis Maguire, that he consistently ate with his prop knife. "It's about honoring the details," Griffith said. "And it's an added bonus if you have something to dig into, and take you away from yourself. Although the series carries certain devices of other crime dramas, they are covered in the grit and deceit of a point in New York's history that is rarely portrayed. The actors sport hand-sewn satin gowns and rugged leather coats against a realistic backdrop of swampy, methane stench-ridden Five Points and the clean-swept cream-colored sidewalks of Fifth Avenue on a 212,500 square-foot studio lot.	1
Virginia prosecutors are asking a state court to set a November 9 execution date for John Allen Muhammad, convicted in a series of sniper-style shootings that terrorized the Washington area in 2002. John Allen Muhammad was sentenced to death for the slaying of Dean Harold Meyers. In a letter dated Wednesday, Senior Assistant Attorney General Katherine B. Burnett said the November date "has been carefully coordinated with the governor's office to insure his availability for any clemency petition Muhammad may wish to pursue." Burnett enclosed a copy of a proposed execution order "for the court's convenience." Muhammad's attorney said he will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, and will ask the governor for clemency. During a three-week period in October 2002, police say, Muhammad and his young protege, Lee Boyd Malvo, shot 13 people, killing 10. The two also are suspected in other shootings and murders in Tacoma, Washington, Montgomery, Alabama, and the Washington, D.C., area. Muhammad, now 48, was convicted of murder in the death of Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Virginia, filling station. Meyers was killed by a single bullet, which became the signature of the two-person sniper team. Ultimately, Muhammad was convicted of the Meyers' killing and of one Maryland murder, which prosecutors there said was "insurance" in case the Virginia conviction was overturned. Malvo was convicted of one Virginia shooting and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Muhammad's attorney, Jon Sheldon, released the prosecutor's letter Friday. The letter, addressed to the chief judge of the Prince William County Circuit Court, says the court must hold a hearing within 10 days of receiving the letter, and must set an execution date no later than 60 days after the hearing. Since Muhammad is not required to be at the hearing, Burnett asks that the court conduct the hearing by means of a conference call.	1
Actress and animal rights activist Eva Mendes hopes you'll shun fur as you shop for the holidays. "Even if you buy a fur glove with the little trim, and you think 'Oh, my God, it's just a little icky,' you are feeding a fur-farming system in a way," she said."I believe the consumer has a right to know what's being marketed to them through the products they purchase."Ms Mendes said she would be "very worried" if she saw a fur product advertised right on a commercial TV show, or on a billboard. "It's my right to know what's on the shelves."She has an idea of what she would look for when she shops. "I would look at the label very carefully," she said. "I would check what they were saying about the animal, and I would want to know everything about the ingredients of the product. And I would want to know that it was humane."If it's a cute little toy rabbit, then I would look at the fur, then at the label, and if the fur is nice, then I would take that toy rabbit home."The activist and actress believes that if the product were humane and environmentally sound, people would buy any product that is advertised."I grew up in a place where the animal cruelty, the suffering and the slaughter of animals was rampant," said Ms Mendes."Once I knew that, I was very careful about what I ate, the clothes I wore, I was very careful about what kind of car I drove."I went from a very, you know, fast-talking person, to one that takes very few chances and is very careful."I hope that if I can help educate people, that they can make better decisions about what they buy. I don't see it as a bad thing."The film 'The Hunting Ground' also tells how the US Congress passed the Animal Enterprise Protection Act in 1973 which allowed an animal rights group "to sue" in federal court anyone who had slaughtered an endangered species.

Just 10 days after the celebrations of winning the Monaco Grand Prix, Mercedes is facing the possibility of sanctions after being called to the International Tribunal of Formula One's governing body. The German team and the sport's tire supplier Pirelli have been summoned to explain an alleged illegal tire test to the FIA's disciplinary body. The tribunal has the power to impose fines and bans, including exclusion from the F1 world championship. The FIA began an investigation after rival teams Red Bull and Ferrari lodged an official protest on the morning of the Monaco race after discovering Mercedes had helped Pirelli carry out a three-day development test in Spain, which was reported by the stewards. "The conditions of this testing may constitute a breach of the applicable FIA rules," the governing body said in a statement. In-season testing has been banned in F1 since 2009 but Pirelli has an agreement that says it can run 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque during the season -- as long as every team is offered that opportunity. After gathering evidence from the Italian tire manufacturer, Mercedes and the other 10 teams, the FIA has decided that Mercedes has a case to answer -- though a date has not yet been set for the hearing before a 12-man panel. Mercedes' rivals objected because it used race drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to carry out the test in the team's 2013 car -- and it is primarily for these reasons the sport's governing body is bringing the case before its tribunal. The rival teams have accused Mercedes of gaining a significant competitive advantage from the test and of conducting it in secret two days after the Spanish Grand Prix, where both Rosberg and Hamilton suffered tire problems despite the German having started in pole position for the second successive race. Mercedes has struggled all season with tire degradation despite being quick in qualifying. Rosberg took the team's first grand prix win of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix, held on a slower, street circuit that is not as harsh on tires. Mercedes released a statement in response to the news that read: "We welcome the opportunity to explain the full facts of the Pirelli test in an open and transparent manner at the International Tribunal. "Sporting integrity is of primary importance to Mercedes-Benz and we have the utmost confidence in the due process of the FIA." Pirelli tried to assuage the situation by issuing a statement, prior to the FIA's summons to its International Tribunal, explaining the controversial tire test.	1
When an anonymous donor gave art to the Goodwill as an early holiday gift this month, the staff thought it was junk. "Across the board they thought it was ugly," said Shea Munroe, who sorts the art ike a pro. "They said, 'Wouldn't the public be upset if they gave this to a charity?'"Munroe took the unwanted art out of the cardboard and then, after working overtime, decided to use the work to create a piece of art. "I feel like I did something amazing with it," he said. "It's a feeling of pride I had that night. It was so fun to see myself stand up with the people that work there. They all went crazy."Goodwill is the only nonprofit in New York that regularly picks up garbage, old clothing and broken toys from people. The staff tries to bring good to people's lives rather than giving them just one thing. People who have nothing to send home with them can use the organization's collection of unused appliances, clothes and toys to create original art.The art that the staff of Goodwill created this month can be found at Goodwill Arts.There's a "candy art" that turns waste into a work of art. There's a "cinema art" that creates a new movie from a video in the form of an old movie. There's a urn that fills with junk in the form of a child's toys and flowers. There's a "spaghetti art" that combines two different dishes of spaghetti and a doll, which makes a new dish. And there's a "waste art" that turns an old plastic bag into a new bag filled with new items."You have so many more pieces of junk lying around the house than when you were in your 20s," said Shannon Hagan, who sells art and apparel at the Goodwill store and in her home.Goodwill's art that is sold or donated is in fact just that, said Suzanne Gaffney, who oversees the art program. While Goodwill employees create much of it, much of it is donated or contributed by volunteers, she said.People with nothing to send home with them can use the organization's collection of unused appliances, clothes and toys to create original art.Munroe, 35, said he did not plan a big masterpiece."It was just something I	0
U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the "growing threat" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it "must be matched and translated into action" to have any effect. "Resolutions alone will not be enough, promises on paper cannot keep us safe, lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack," Obama said. If governments abide by the resolution and fully cooperate with one another, the world should become safer, the President said. But it won't be easy, especially given the potential of terrorism to spread beyond the Middle East: Obama noted U.S. intelligence estimates over 15,000 individuals from more than 80 nations have gone to fight in Syria, exacerbating the conflict there and raising the possibility they could "come home" and carry out deadly attacks. "If there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that could not be met by one nation alone it is this: terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence," Obama said. The resolution passed Wednesday requires nations to "suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting, equipping" and financing of "foreign terrorist fighters," according to Obama. It also also calls on government to "help build the capacity of the states on the front lines of the fight." But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said. "Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth: that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women and children, the majority of whom are Muslim," the President said, using his administration's favored term for ISIS. Obama also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability, including in Syria, where he called for "a political solution" to the years-long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups. "We must work to address ... the oppression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence," he said.

A leading opposition figure in Bahrain has been jailed after being charged with "inciting and advocating terrorism," Bahrain's Public Prosecution Office said. Activists in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom, however, insist the charges  are politically motivated  and have demanded his immediate release."It is a criminal charge used by the government to intimidate and silence our independent and peaceful activists," said the Human Rights Society of Bahrain, the country's largest independent human rights group."It is an insult to our commitment to democracy and the rule of law."Bahraini Human Rights Observer Amal al-Ees said authorities have brought six other individuals on charges of terrorism, "including the director of the National Security Agency and the chairman of the State Security Prosecution."The charges against Nasser al-Zawaidi and Ali Isa are the latest in a series of arrests and trials in Bahrain. Their trial, held at Al Mukalla prison on Thursday, drew protesters and officials who had gathered to voice anger over the jailing of some 100 people since February, including seven women."We are prepared to sacrifice our lives to defend the right to speak out and our right to participate. But what we cannot give is our lives, for that is exactly what the authorities are threatening," Naser Muthana, a lawyer for the arrested and convicted activists, said as he spoke outside the court building."We are prepared to sacrifice our lives to demonstrate peacefully against the regime, but we will do it, not to them, but to the regime or its allies in Saudi Arabia and the U.S., which are trying to take us back to the dark ages," he said.Zawaidi, a founding member of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Jurists, which was dissolved by authorities in 2011, is a political activist and human rights defender who has been outspoken against government corruption and repression. He is well known for his defense of his brother, an outspoken opposition figure who was jailed last year for six years for "terrorism" and "inciting" violence.The charges against Zawaidi and Isa were based on a speech he gave to a group of people protesting the arrest of al-Zawaidi's brother.The charges against al-Zawaidi were initially withdrawn by authorities, but then revived and made public last week.The government in Bahrain has denied that the charges against Z	0
Thousands of travelers have been left in the lurch around the world after the carrier Air Australia went into administration and grounded its fleet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning they could no longer fly. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just shocked. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just kind of trying to wrap our heads around this,Ã¢â‚¬Â passenger Joe Moore says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a lot of passengers complaining about lack of staff and lack of flights.Ã¢â‚¬Â Airline staff have reportedly been working flat out on flights to help passengers.I was one of the first passengers to book on Air Australia, I could of stayed on to see the planes leave with their cargo, the company could have kept my ticket for another year.Australia could have saved Ã‚Â $10,000 in fuel by using the planes with Australian engines.I had a similar experience with Air Canada. They were about to suspend operations due to an inability to pay the airline's debts. I called the local travel agent and they agreed to book me on their flight to Toronto. The flight was canceled.The flights were not profitable. Some companies do it to force airlines to lower their prices as they need more revenue. However, airlines need to make sure they don't fly to the world's countries where prices are higher. The whole thing is just one big scam, and it's unfair when people are going to have to pay more.It's a good sign that there is enough support for the airline for them to be allowed to continue flying. I was on a number of services where the staff were willing to fly to a destination but they didn't want to pay for my ticket. I'd prefer to be able to pay for my own ticket, though.I have heard of an airline that was forced to sell fuel for some of their flights to Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

A viral video has real officers going for laughs with the serious intent of finding their next police chief. "We wanted something that expressed our culture of openness," said Hillsboro, Oregon, Lt. Michael Rouches, the department's public information officer. "It's not that we take our jobs lightly, it's that we tend to approach every situation with a positive attitude. So we thought, 'how could we demonstrate that message to a potential chief of police?'" The answer came in the form of a scripted video that's part "Law and Order," part "Parks and Recreation." It's been a smash on YouTube. Running a little more than six minutes, the video comprises sketch routines featuring officers on the 120-member force. "This is our dispatcher, Earleen," an officer says cheerfully in one sequence. "She's fantastic; you can reach her at 911." All the officers, except one acting "cool," are from the department. The two bad guys are professional actors. The video was shot over three days in early July and cost about $9,200. Rouches said the money came from the city's marketing budget. "It's public money, and when we look at the return on this $9,000 we spent, the fact is that a lot of folks are paying attention," he said. "I'm also very sensitive to the public's trust about the money, but the feedback from the people in our city has been very positive." Hillsboro may be looking for an image makeover as well. The previous police chief resigned in March amid labor tensions, according to The Oregonian newspaper. In addition, a former commander filed a hostile work environment action against the interim police chief, who left in June, the newspaper said. Rouches said the environment has greatly improved. "The issues internally have never been issues externally; they've never manifested themselves out in the field, and that's where the rubber meets the road for us," he said. Will the video be a hit or miss? Will it start a trend for first-responders looking for applicants? Lauri Stevens, a social media consultant for police departments, thought Hillsboro did the right thing. "This video in my opinion was (and) is a risk," Stevens said. "But I think in the long run, it's going to be a big win for both their reputation and their selection options for the next chief."	1
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is receiving bids to build a five-story complex for the Israeli Air Force, or IAF, near Tel Aviv. The facility, mysteriously dubbed "site 911," will be built under the auspices of the Foreign Military Sales program and is expected to cost the U.S. between $25 million and $100 million, according to a solicitation for bids posted on a U.S. government website. Only U.S. construction firms are able to bid on this contract, and the deadline for proposals is December 3, according to the notice. The notice, first reported on by The Washington Post, includes structural plans that show the first three underground floors are roughly 41,000 square feet and will include classrooms on Level 1, an auditorium on Level 3 and shock-resistant doors throughout. The architectural plans, drawn up by prominent Israeli firm Ada Karmi-Melamede Architects, pays close attention to the aesthetics of the design as well as the functional parameters outlined in the solicitation. For example, three picnic tables are planned for the exterior. Atypical to most Corps of Engineers contracts, the contractor hired will be required to supply mezuzahs, which it describes as parchment inscribed with Torah verses, "for each door or opening exclusive of toilets or shower rooms." Generally, mezuzahs are placed in a case and attached to a door frame as a sign of the Jewish faith. The construction site, on an established Israeli Air Force base, will be guarded by "an Israeli citizen who served in the IAF" and will be separated from military installations with a solid 6-foot fence. Despite the precautions taken around the base, construction workers will be subject to stringent security regulations. Non-Israeli employees are required to arrive on and exit from the site "in a group only"; "the fenced area shall have one gate only for both entering and exiting the site"; and during work hours, employees are prohibited from leaving the base. The notice also states that the employment of non-Israeli citizens is forbidden, except those from "the U.S., Canada, Western Europe countries, Poland, Moldavia, Thailand, Philippines, Venezuela, Romania and China." It specifies that the employment of Palestinians is strictly prohibited. In addition, it says, "the Contracting Officer retains all rights to refuse or inhibit employment of any employee."	1
The latest in a series of beleaguered Carnival cruises made its way back to port early Sunday, capping a harrowing week for passengers aboard several troubled ships. The Carnival Legend arrived in Tampa, Florida, hours ahead of schedule Sunday morning after iceshore winds and rough weather caused the ship to run aground in New Jersey late Friday.A Carnival ship which had sailed to Cuba was forced to turn back in the Florida Straits Sunday after a problem with the rudder caused it to run aground.The Legend was carrying about 500 passengers when it ran aground early Friday after it left Havana, Cuba, about a month into a six-day sailing along with six other ships to the Caribbean island. The Legend left Havana for the Florida Keys on Friday. During the return trip it hit a rock about 200 years old, then came to rest about 100 miles north of New Port Richey, Florida.The ship was still tied up around 300 miles west of Tampa Sunday morning but was drifting about 3 feet below the surface of Tampa's bay, Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Barrera told CNN.A Coast Guard crane was using the ship's stern to try to get it off the rocks, Barrera said."Right now she's sitting in the water just 3 feet below the surface and if the winds pick up, which they will, they may rise to 6 feet," he said."But we've got other ships coming to the rescue, we've got helicopters from the National Guard, the Coast Guard, and we're bringing in a Navy tug."The Legend is a 683-foot ship with a crew of about 800, Barrera said."There are a lot of people aboard that still don't have food, they don't have water, they are on board waiting for food and water," he said.The ship ran aground before dawn Friday, leaving all passengers on board without food and water for several days because the ship's refrigerated food and drinking water was not running properly, he said."The ship was not anchored but was drifting, and so it would come in and out of our bay," he told CNN. "Sometimes when that happens, you get a large object that is like a small boat, but it's moving."The ship was scheduled to arrive in Fort Myers, Florida, Saturday.

Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. "I very quickly realized two things," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. "One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change." "The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening." He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling.	1
This last week has been chock full of gaffes by our presidential candidates -- a veritable gaffe-a-thon, a gaffe-a-palooza. President Obama and the Republican presidential candidates almost seem to be trying to one-up each other's blunders. This "March Madness" started off slowly enough last Monday with a small one by Rick Santorum: "I don't care what the unemployment rate is going to be. It doesn't matter to me." But then, just days later, the gaffes started flying fast and furious. On Wednesday, Mitt Romney's communication director Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN that he wasn't concerned if Romney was moving to the right on certain key issues during the Republican primaries because, as he put it: "You hit a reset button for the fall campaign. ... It's almost like an Etch A Sketch." Only a few hours later, Rick Santorum, armed with an Etch A Sketch, commented that if voters are offered a choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney in this November's election: "We might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk with what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate for the future." And then President Obama joined in. On Sunday, unaware that his microphone was on while he was speaking to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev about missile defense treaty negotiations, commented: "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." If you were a staff member of any of these campaigns, you must have consumed an industrial size bottle of Pepcid AC over the last few days. But for the rest of us in America, these moments are great -- it's just what we need to accurately assess our candidates. Let's be honest, these comments were not "gaffes" as the media dubs them, but rather, rare opportunities for us to have an unfiltered look at the candidates' character and views on issues.	1
The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from a North Carolina county that had regularly opened its public meetings with Christian prayers. The church-state dispute is a victory for two Forsyth County residents who brought suit against the Board of Commissioners. Janet Joyner and Constance Lynn Blackmon were represented in their court challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. "When government meetings are opened regularly with Christian prayer, it sends the unmistakable message that non-Christians are second-class citizens in their own community," said the Rev. Barry Lynn, who heads Americans United, a Washington-based group. "The Constitution clearly forbids government to play favorites when it comes to religion." Court records show that 26 of 33 invocations given at the council meetings in 2007 and 2008 contained references to Jesus Christ, the Trinity, or other Christian symbols or names. Clergy members from the community often delivered the sectarian invocations. The county seat is Winston-Salem, one the largest cities in the state. A federal appeals court last year found the prayers to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government endorsement of one religion over another. The case is Forsyth County, N.C., v. Joyner (11-546). The high court also turned aside a pair of student speech cases involving off-campus activity in the digital age. Both appeals involved school suspensions of students who engaged in cyberattacks using their home computers. In one appeal from northeastern Pennsylvania, the justices let stand a lower-court ruling in favor of an eighth-grade girl who created a fake MySpace profile of her male principal, who was described as a "hairy sex addict" and a "pervert." Attached was a real photo of James McGonigle of Blue Mountain Middle School near Allentown. Court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty, and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days. Her parents, Steven and Terry Snyder, then sued and were represented by the ACLU, which called the posting a "juvenile humor" parody. A federal appeals court concluded that the posting caused no substantial disruption at the school, and that officials lacked authority "to punish students for off-campus speech."	1

A judge needs to decide if new lawyers are needed to defend Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other prisoners charged in the September 11 terrorist attacks or if more hearings should be conducted on whether there's any conflict of interest caused by an FBI investigation. A U.S. Justice Department lawyer acknowledged Monday that the FBI investigated members of the team representing Mohammed and the other Guantanamo Bay detainees accused of the September 11 attacks, prompting the lead defense lawyer to threaten to pull out of the case out of fears that he too is a subject of a federal probe. "I do have a reasonable fear. I am trimming my sails. I am pulling my punches. I am being extremely careful about how I proceed," David Nevel told the military commission hearing the case, adding that he canceled a trip to the Middle East to do investigative work. Defense attorneys argued that the FBI essentially infiltrated and spied on them by asking members of the team if the lawyers were engaged in suspicious activity. The lawyers said in court that two civilian investigators, a classification expert and Mohammed's linguist were approached by the FBI. The FBI investigation centered on the release of classified information to unknown third parties that are not part of the case. Fernando Campanor-Sanchez, an assistant United States attorney, said the investigations are now closed and that none of the lawyers or anyone else on team are currently under investigation. The four that were under investigation no longer work for the defense team. Undisclosed FBI questions could slow Guantanamo detainee trials	1
What is seen by some as the holy four-day weekend for geek culture at San Diego Comic-Con has gone mainstream in a big way for the past few years. Are you a Comic-Con beginner? Get the rules right! Starting today, there will be panels called "I Can't Write, I Can't Draw, But I Love Comics!" and "Indie Comics Marketing 101" taking place alongside "USA Network's 'Psych' " and "Aloha, Earth!" a panel about CBS' upcoming remake of "Hawaii Five-0." But this recent spate of panels about movie and TV properties with no sci-fi or comic book elements has some fans fuming. "The mainstream TV and film representation at Comic-Con has outstripped the original essence of the convention," said iReporter Brad Powers who attended Comic-Con the past two years, mainly for the panels on "Lost." He believed that this "mainstreaming" of the convention has played a hand in it being filled to capacity. Going to San Diego Comic-Con? For one panel, Powers said he arrived a full 45 minutes before it was set to begin. "Thirty minutes passed and I thought for sure I was getting closer to the front door. Finally, 10 minutes after the start, some nice Con attendee started walking back through the line to let everyone know that they were full up and no one else would be getting in." Powers is not attending the convention this year since "Lost" has ended. One iReporter, Michelle Cruz, has not attended in years. "I don't even try anymore," she said." "They should have a Commercialism-Con and bring back Comic-Con the way it used to be." "It's too crowded, too commercial, and, oh yea, it sells out before you even know who's gonna be there," she said. "I'd be really disappointed spending my money and seeing that I was gonna go to a panel discussion about [the Fox series] 'Glee.' " The fact that "Glee" attended last year (and is returning this year) certainly seemed to fuel anger among some Comic-Con devotees. "It used to be the coolest thing in the world and now it's just a reason not to drive downtown for a few days."	1
A federal court judge on Tuesday ordered Massachusetts officials to provide sex-reassignment surgery for a transsexual prison inmate, after determining that it was the only adequate treatment for the inmate's mental illness. The state's Department of Correction said Michelle Kosilek, previously known as Robert, who is serving a life sentence without parole for murdering his wife in 1990, has a gender identity disorder. She attempted to castrate herself and tried to commit suicide twice while incarcerated in an all-male prison in Norfolk, according to a court order. "We are very happy with the ruling, of course. We are still reviewing the opinion and we anticipate the Department of Corrections will follow Judge Wolf's order and promptly arrange for Michelle Kosilek to receive her treatment," Kosilek's attorney Joseph Sulman said Tuesday. The Chart: Treatment guidelines for Gender Identity Disorder in development Chief Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled that sex reassignment surgery is the "only adequate treatment" for Kosilek, and "that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care." "This is the first decision in which the court has ordered a prison to provide sex reassignment surgery as the necessary medical treatment for a transsexual inmate," said Ben Klein, senior attorney with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders. But according to court documents, this ruling was not an unfamiliar case for this court. Kosilek's case dates back two decades ago, when she was first incarcerated. According to Francis Cohen, the lead counsel of Kosilek's initial lawsuit, Kosilek did not receive any treatment for her disorder from 1992 to 2002, even though she had repeatedly asked the prison for help. It wasn't until 1999, when Kosilek first filed suit, that the court recognized her medical needs. In 2002, the court found that the Department of Correction had refused to provide Kosilek with the proper medical treatment she needed as had been prescribed by the department's doctors. In that ruling, the court found that the department's refusal was "rooted in sincere security concerns, and in fear of public and political criticism as well." That year, Kosilek began to receive necessary medical treatments in the form of psychotherapy and hormone treatments. "It's quite common that the denial of important medical treatments is based on a bias against transgender people rather than on science," Klein said.

British prosecutors have charged a former aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron and a close confidant of media baron Rupert Murdoch with illegal eavesdropping on voice mail, authorities said Tuesday. Cameron's former director of communications Andy Ã‚Â¥KâWilliams and James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert, are accused of illegally intercepting the voicemails of celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise and Kate Middleton. The case will come before a grand jury in Los Angeles later this month, when a judge will decide whether to bring additional charges.The case is believed to be one of the first to be brought against journalists for the interception of phone calls or other electronic communications. The Associated Press, Reuters and the BBC are among the news organizations that have been named in the complaint that alleges a conspiracy among news executives and police officials to illegally eavesdrop on people's phone calls without a judge's order. The case against Murdoch and Williams, who worked closely with Cameron, comes just months after Cameron was forced to defend himself publicly when Murdoch's News Corp. newspaper hacked the cell-phone messages of thousands of his political opponents in the United Kingdom during the U.K. campaign. ÃÃ‚Â(Reuters) -- James Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch, acknowledged Monday that he had used his access to the family's media empire to hack the email accounts of News Corp. journalists, admitting he was "inexcusable" for doing so in a separate breach at the newspaper's British arm.Ã‚Â ÂIÃ¢Â’m sorry that I have caused so much harm to the people of Britain and to our team,Ã‚Â James Murdoch said in a rare moment at News Corp.Ã‚Âs annual general meeting in the U.S. state of Delaware.(WSJÂ’s Dan Farber and Tom Bower)(Bloomberg) -- Rupert Murdoch, who runs the world's most powerful communications network, is battling an internal investigation at his British newspapers over the hacking of dozens of high-profile journalists' mobile phone accounts without a court order.(USA Today) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is fighting an internal investigation at British media companies over the use of his mobile phone to hack journalists' voicemails.

Indian authorities in Mumbai were battling fires at two luxury hotels on Thursday night , more than 20 hours after a series of terror attacks that killed more than 100 people. A fire burns through the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wâ¢Â¢65â¢â‚¬Â“, which is also known as the Oberoi Palace and the Taj GroupÃ¢â‚¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢s former headquarters, in suburban MumbaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central business district on August 19, 2008. (AP Photo/File)New Delhi: In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the ban on the entry of non-Muslims to the holy city of Ayodhya — a contentious issue in religious history. The apex court, by a majority of 5-4, found the Babri mosque a 'panchayat' mosque and ordered the restoration of the revered site as it existed before the Babri mosque was demolished and the structure constructed later.In upholding the order, the apex court ruled out any possibility of any Muslim challenging the demolition order in a court of law.While the SC had earlier directed the Allahabad HC to restore the structure or face contempt proceedings, the apex court's decision was "unanimous", taking a stand which overruled all earlier directions and orders of the Supreme Court.It has also taken up the question of demolition of the 5.30-acre Babri mosque in Ayodhya, where a historic mosque was demolished in 1992 by the then Chief Minister, late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This is seen as a political move by BJP as the temple was built as a part of the Babri Masjid, built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan.In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court held that Ayodhya had not been created a "panchayat" (a government administrative unit) under Article 35-A of the Constitution and therefore, it could not be called a "mosque".Though the SC held that the mosque was not a panchayat mosque, Justice D Y Chandrachud observed that the mosque was a mosque and as such, it needed to be "restored". He also said the court should find out whether the demolition	0

The king of the South Pacific nation of Tonga died "peacefully" Sunday at a hospital in Hong Kong, a Tongan government official said Monday. He was 63. A cause of death has not been released by the government. Â â€œThe king passed away peacefully at 4:30 p.m. (local time) at the Prince of Wales Hospital," the Tonga president, Enele Sopoaga, announced Monday in a brief statement on the government's website. "He had been suffering from a lung condition. He has been at the hospital for a week and a half." Â â€œHe is in good hands at the hospital and we were with him during his stay," Sopoaga said. Sopoaga said the king arrived at the hospital on the island of Funafuti in Fiji Monday but was unable to fly to Tonga because of travel restrictions there. Â â€œHe was suffering from difficulty breathing but was being kept comfortable at the hospital,â€ Sopoaga said. TONGA'S HONLEGE? Â â€œThe king passed away from a serious disease," Sopoaga said. Â â€œWe shall miss him terribly. He was a very kind and caring king. He had a very important role on various occasions. â€œWe shall be very busy in the coming days and weeks to organize the funeral. Our government will be working very hard in order to make sure that he is given the appropriate services. We will do everything within our capacities,â€ Sopoaga added. The Tonga president and the government had announced the death on Sunday afternoon. Â â€œThe announcement was due to health problems,â€ a senior government official told AFP.

Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg." To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm. Years before RFID chips became common, this small implant allowed him to turn on lights by snapping his fingers, or open doors without touching them. Once, after connecting his nerves to an array of electrodes in 2002, he let his wife use her brain waves to take control of his body. It was the first time the nervous systems of two humans had communicated electronically. "It was quite an intimate feeling," he says. This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel. He is certain that without upgrading, we humans will someday fall behind the advances of the robots we're building -- or worse. "Someday we'll switch on that machine, and we won't be able to switch it off," he says, sounding a note of alarm that clashes with the cheery visions of futurists like Ray Kurzweil. That might explain why he has very little technology at home, and counts "The Terminator" among his biggest influences. Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human. Augmenting human ability, not turning into an automaton, is, after all, the premise of the "cyborg." One of the term's earliest uses, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was in a 1960 New York Times article: "A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one."

Germany's government has asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave. It's a punitive gesture usually reserved for adversarial nations in times of crisis and only very rarely for an ally, particularly a very close one. But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said. And it's time for a reset. Germany let loose the diplomatic slap, reminiscent of a Cold War rebuke, after news of two new possible U.S. espionage cases broke back to back in a week's time. Two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- are suspected of spying for the United States. Local media report that both cases involve stolen official German documents. The U.S. official shown the door is based in Berlin at the U.S. Embassy, which followed up on Friday's announcement with a note to journalists: "The U.S. Embassy has seen the reports that Germany has asked the U.S. Mission Germany's intelligence chief to leave the country. As a standard practice, we will not comment on intelligence matters." A German official confirmed that person was the CIA's station chief and that the agency's director, John Brennan, has talked multiple times with his German counterpart. 'So much stupidity' Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days. Most pointedly, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble casually described the alleged U.S. actions as "daft" before a television talk show audience. "One can only cry over so much stupidity," he said. He based his remarks on the essential value of Germany's cooperation with U.S. intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship. Legal action The latest allegations weigh densely on ties already burdened since Edward Snowden leaked indications that the National Security Agency tapped into Merkel's own cell phone. They have seemingly undone any of Washington's diplomatic smoothing over previously alleged NSA intrusions. One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel. The NSA scandal has also prompted prosecutors to set up a new special committee to investigate and criminally prosecute cyberspying by foreign intelligence.	1
Immediately after the September 11, 2001, terrorist acts, Sikhs came under attack. Mistaken for Muslims because of their beards and turbans, they became ripe targets for zealots seeking revenge. The first  were Sikhs who lived peacefully in their own communities. When they were identified they were threatened with beatings and even murder. The assault on the Sikhs and their American friends and family went on for weeks.Sohrab Ahmari was working at a car plant in Indiana when he started taking classes at a Sikh temple. Ahmari studied the history of Sikhism and studied the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, the great Indian religious figures. That year he received an invitation from the United States to visit. He had not planned to visit that year. But the invitation came, and he accepted it, despite his reservations.Sohrab was not afraid. He was not planning to visit America. He was a scientist, and he intended to do research. His plan was to study the effect of the bombing of the World Trade Center on the human body. How many people had died? How had this terrorist attack affected them? He had heard a presentation by a scientist—a professor at Indiana University in Indianapolis—who had done research on the effect on the human body of the air-raid sirens in New York. That would be the subject for his research in the year 2001 and the subjects for the seminars he had to give that year.Sohrab studied hard at the temple, learned the chants and the Gurmukhi language, memorized the poems of the Guru Granth Sahib and the teachings of the Gurus. He was a practicing Sikh for five years, but in 1997, with time on his hands and a new career on his hands—he was in the tire industry in Indiana, starting as a sales manager—he decided to visit India. He took all his belongings and got on the next plane to Delhi. He did not tell anyone about his plans.When he got to India, Sohrab did not have the faintest idea of what he was going to find. He and his family had not been to India for thirty years and they had not known the country. He was amazed at the sheer beauty of the country and the people. He spoke only the three Indian languages, Punjabi, Haryanvi and Urdu, and the Gurmukhi language. And	0
Today, the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. All 278 words. Three days later, on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Americans will recall his most moving speeches, also crisp and concise. The lesson is clear: To express big ideas, use few words. New media, such as Twitter and texting, demand brevity. But brevity is also important if you're communicating as Americans did before "tweet" became a noun and a verb. The newest technologies reinforce the oldest technique of effective writing and speaking: Keep it simple. Although the Gettysburg Address was deceptively simple -- 10 sentences, consisting mostly of one or two-syllable words -- it communicated complex concepts. As the historian Garry Wills has written, by stressing the egalitarian ideas of the Declaration of Independence, "Lincoln had revolutionized the Revolution, giving people a new past to live with that would change their future indefinitely." Lincoln's new vision of "a new nation, conceived in liberty," rather than a loose federation of states, foreshadowed a national government that takes the lead in protecting the rights and promoting the well-being of its citizens. Ken Burns: Learn Lincoln's words by heart Almost a century later, President Kennedy looked to Lincoln's oratory as a model of clarity. Preparing his inaugural address, Kennedy asked his speechwriter, Theodore Sorensen, to read every previous inaugural and also the Gettysburg Address. As Sorensen later recalled, he was impressed by how "Lincoln never used a two- or three-syllable word where a one-syllable word would do, and never used three words where one word would do." Sorensen's early drafts reflected this lesson, and, as historians and memoirists have agreed, Kennedy's revisions made the speech sparer still. The most memorable line -- "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country" -- includes only one word (used twice) longer than one syllable. Lesson from Lincoln: Mr. President, you're talking too much Still, some despair that Twitter has dumbed-down public speech. They should re-read history. Long before Twitter, TV sound bites, telegraph dispatches and tabloid headlines all put a premium on big ideas, briefly expressed. The best way to grab someone's attention has always been to say something simply.	1
American fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers, one of which buzzed a U.S. aircraft carrier in the western Pacific on Saturday, U.S. military officials told CNN Monday. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that there was no violation of flight regulations during the incident. A ministry official said the flights are standard operating procedure for air force training. One of them twice flew about 2,000 feet over the deck of the USS Nimitz Saturday while another flew about 50 miles away, officials said. Two others were at least 100 miles away, the military reported. U.S. defense officials said four F/A-18A fighter jets from the Nimitz were in the air. The Russians and the U.S. carrier did not exchange verbal communications.  Watch U.S. aircraft carrier USS Nimitz » Four turboprop Tupolev-95 Bear bombers took off from Ukrainka Air Base, in Russia's Far East, in the middle of the night, Japanese officials told The Associated Press, adding that one of the planes violated Japanese airspace. Russian bombers have been making flights over the western Pacific for several months. There have been eight incidents off Alaska since July. Among the latest, on September 5,  six F-15s from Elmendorf Air Force Base, adjacent to Anchorage, Alaska, intercepted six Russian bombers about 50 miles from the northwest coast of Alaska. Two similar incidents occurred in August, one near Cape Lisburne, Alaska, and the other near Cold Bay, Alaska, west of the Aleutian Islands.  E-mail to a friend	1
Brittany Maynard, the terminally ill woman who plans to take her own life, has checked the last item off her bucket list. She visited the Grand Canyon last week. "The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful," she wrote on her website, "and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature." Photos showed her and her husband standing on the edge of the canyon, hugging and kissing. But her cancer reasserted itself. "Severe headaches and neck pain are never far away, and unfortunately the next morning I had my worst seizure thus far," she wrote on her website. "My speech was paralyzed for quite a while after I regained consciousness, and the feeling of fatigue continued for the rest of the day." Maynard, 29, had been married a year when she discovered she had an aggressive brain cancer. Last April, doctors said she had six months to live. She considered dying in a hospice, she wrote in an op-ed piece for CNN. "I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family," she wrote  for CNN. "We had to uproot from California to Oregon, because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized." Maynard posted YouTube videos in which she and family members talked about her decision and supported an expansion of assisted suicide laws. She supports an organization, Compassion and Choices, to promote that idea. "My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity," she wrote on her website. Dying young: Why Brittany Maynard's story resonates	1
Last week began with a missing persons report filed for Katherine Jackson but ended with Michael Jackson's mother attending a "Unity" concert by four of her sons. In the days between, a complex family feud played out in headlines and on celebrity TV. The 82-year-old Jackson family matriarch lost custody of the late pop icon's three children, who were placed into the guardianship of their cousin TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff suspended her as the children's custodian, saying she may be "prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties." Four of her children -- including Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson -- had taken their mother to an Arizona spa, but kept her whereabouts secret from their other siblings and Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket. Katherine Jackson to share custody of Michael Jackson's children Those involved called it an intervention to protect their mother from people abusing her, while Paris and Prince Jackson made it clear they thought their aunts and uncles were trying to gain influence and control over Katherine Jackson. When Paris didn't hear from her grandmother for over a week, she tweeted "8 days and counting . something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk directly to my grandmother!!<|3" Katherine Jackson returned home early last Thursday to find a house in turmoil. "Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to," Prince Jackson said in bitter Twitter posting attacking his aunts and uncles. "I'm really angry and hurt." There was a "scuffle" inside Katherine Jackson's Calabasas, California, home last Monday after Randy, Jermaine and Janet approached Michael Jackson's children in what witnesses said was an attempt to convince them to leave with them. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies broke it up and filed a battery report, a sheriff's spokesman said. Despite a relative calm in the Jackson family feud that set in over the weekend, youngest son Randy Jackson remained on the attack Monday against the men who run the Michael Jackson estate, accusing them of trying to isolate his mother so they could control the heirs they are obligated by law to protect.	1
Marathon talks between Hollywood's largest actors union and producers broke off early Saturday, with the Screen Actors Guild saying it will ask its members to authorize a strike. Screen Actors Guild members and supporters stage a rally Ã¢â‚¬â€¨ â?¢ Monday afternoon, in memory of Marjorie Jackson, who was killed in a car accident last week.The battle lines have been drawn over the past few months, with the union and producers locked in a dispute about a handful of proposed changes to the guild's contract for actors.One of them would have forced all performers, not just actors, to be union members Ã¢â‚¬â€¨ and that would have forced unions, which include unionized employees such as stagehands, carpenters and janitors, to pay those workers.The proposed contract modification would also have put some limitations on television performers, in order to protect them Ã¢â‚¬â€¨ from being exploited by television networks, who would have been less likely to schedule them if television actors were less likely to appear on prime time programs. Both the union and producers said the modifications were needed to improve the guild's bargaining position.In the days since the proposed contract modification has been discussed by the guild's negotiating committee, the guild has not agreed to it, and has sent a letter to the union and other major studios seeking a "timely resolution."Pro-union producer/actor Mike Medavoy of Universal Studios told The Hollywood Reporter this morning that a strike would be damaging to the industry, and that it would have a negative impact on the movie business."I think [it would be] bad for the entire industry," he said. "I think it takes away from the fact that you have a lot of people in the studio system. I think it would hurt the movie business in San Francisco and Los Angeles."The guild and studios reached an impasse this summer when the guild said it wanted to move the time limits in actors' contracts to the early '80s. The two sides had been talking about the idea for several months, and it was also a subject discussed in the guild's contract negotiations with the studios this summer, but the two sides could not agree on it.The battle over the proposed contract modification, which union members say is the key issue in the dispute between the guild	0
No amount of economic growth will land you a job if you get unfairly snagged in the FBI's faulty background check system. And you can lose your job because of the FBI file inaccuracies, too. After working without incident at a Philadelphia port for 33 years, Russ F. was told he was out of a job when a newly required post-9/11 security clearance check found an arrest dating back to 1971. Charges were never filed, and Russ was never prosecuted. But the nearly 40-year-old arrest was reported on his FBI background check with no additional information, and Russ needed months to track down documentation to prove he had never been convicted or even charged with a crime. Only then could he regain his job. A National Employment Law Project report found the FBI ran a record 16.9 million employment background checks -- a six-fold increase from a decade ago -- for jobs ranging from child care to truck driving, port workers to mortgage processors. Although background checks can contribute to workplace safety, inaccuracies in the FBI database mean that these checks are blocking about 600,000 Americans a year from jobs for which they may be perfectly qualified. This unfair barrier to employment can and must be fixed. The glitch is that FBI records often fail to report the final outcomes of arrests. The case might have been dismissed or the charges reduced, but a prospective employer might not know it from the FBI background check. Roughly one-third of all felony arrests don't result in conviction, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and many more are reduced to misdemeanors. By the Justice Department's own count, roughly 50% of FBI background records are incomplete and don't include the final outcome of an arrest. In the face of such errors, only a fraction of job seekers successfully correct their FBI records -- and then only with great effort and expense. Those unable to correct their reports are often trapped in a cycle of poverty that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decried in a recent speech.	1
(The Hollywood Reporter)It may be time to light the lights. ABC is filming a proof of concept for a revival of "The Muppets," The Hollywood Reporter has learned. "The Big Bang Theory" co-creator Bill Prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at May's upfront presentation to Madison Avenue advertisers. Sources tell THR that the project, if all goes well, could go straight to series. Bob Kushell ("Anger Management," "3rd Rock From the Sun") will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner, with Wilfred's Randall Einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation. ABC's "Muppets" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns. The presentation is set to film next weekend on the Disney lot in Burbank with some of the original Muppet performers returning. Sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by Jim Henson — Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Animal, among others — gathering at ABC Studios for a meeting about the new "Muppet Show." However, the show won't move forward unless Miss Piggy signs on, and her current relationship with frequent love Kermit is on the rocks, preventing the show from getting off the ground. Early plans call for two celebrity cameos — including Miss Piggy's current co-star — as well as new roles including Fozzie's girlfriend and her parents. For Prady, the revived "Muppets" — which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix — marks a return to his roots. The producer, who currently does not have an overall deal, started his career working for Henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for "The Jim Henson Hour," remaining on the series until a year after Henson's death in 1990.	1
Two Mexican brothers have been extradited to the United States to join a third brother to face sex trafficking charges in New York as part of a complex collaborative effort to combat human trafficking, federal officials said Monday. Benito Lopez-Perez, 32, and Anastasio Romero-Perez, 39, were arraigned on a 25-count indictment Monday morning in Brooklyn Federal Court, the U.S. attorney and the Justice Department said in a news release. The extensive indictment is the product of the Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiative, an in-depth partnership involving the Department of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Urban Justice Center and many non-profit and non-governmental organizations in the United States and Mexico, the release said. "The indictment charges the defendants with sex trafficking, interstate prostitution, alien smuggling and money laundering offenses, involving victims as young as 14 and 15 years old," it said. On December 3, the third brother, Jose Gabino Barrientos-Perez, 51, was extradited from Mexico to face the same charges, officials said. U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch also announced the extradition last month of Antonio Lira-Robles on the same charges. All the extraditions resulted from the comprehensive anti-trafficking program, which has so far resulted in the indictment of 52 defendants on sex trafficking charges and has "rescued over 100 victims, including 17 minors," the release said. "The sex trafficking of young girls and women is modern-day slavery we will do everything in our power to eradicate," Lynch said in a news conference Monday. She also announced the reuniting of a victim of sex trafficking with her child after a separation of more than 10 years. The mother was involved with the Carreto family sex trafficking ring, officials said. The ring operated between Mexico and United States from 1991 to 2004, the Justice Department said upon Carreto's sentencing in 2009. United States v. Carreto is considered to be "one of the first sex trafficking cases prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn," according to Monday's news release, "After substantial post-conviction investigation and international coordination, the child was located and reunited with the victim-mother."	1
A U.S.-run detention center housing 3,000 people will move to Afghan control under a crucial agreement signed Friday that smooths the way toward a larger agreement on the United States' future role in the country. The Âsafe haven,ââ which was to be operated by the U.S. military, will be handed over to the Afghan government in February. The U.S. military had been guarding the camp for five years.The United States has been in Afghanistan since the 1979 invasion, when it withdrew its combat troops in exchange for a promise by then-Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld that the U.S.-led coalition would keep its commitment to the fight and fight the Taliban militarily on its own.There was no promise that the United States would withdraw from the country. And by the end of next year, there will be no such commitment to withdraw entirely.In a rare display of bipartisanship, U.S. and Canadian lawmakers from both parties on Friday voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new Afghan-U.S. deal that would keep the camp in U.S. hands for the next 10 years. The two-article accord would transfer responsibility for the facility from U.S. forces to the Afghan government and allow the U.S. military to hand it over to Afghan security forces in February."We want to do everything we possibly can to keep that safe haven operating," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard Berman, D-Calif., who worked with congressional committees to come up with the deal, which he said is "a very good one."The agreement "has the potential to become a model agreement for all of the countries of the world, a model that would set the standard for future negotiations," Berman said.The deal includes a provision that gives the Afghan government the right to buy and sell the land where the U.S. detention facility is located, which is considered to be worth millions of dollars. The agreement also allows for the U.S. military to keep up to 30 percent of the money in the camp's coffers on the condition that the facility is not used as a transit point for Taliban forces.The agreement also allows for the U.S. military to bring in a team of experts to run the camp, "where we can offer technical and training for the Afghans," Berman said	0
After four countries, three formal state dinners, two speeches to American troops and one encounter with a menacing humanoid robot, President Barack Obama flies home Tuesday having completed his long-awaited trip to Asia. The goals for the visit were ambitious: reassure allies the United States remains committed to a "pivot to Asia," secure new deals to expand trade, and send a message to China that the United States has its allies' backs in territorial disputes. Some of those goals were met; others less so. Here are five takeaways from Obama's trip to Asia: 1. China, China, China Obama came to Asia to bolster ties with Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. But his stops in all four countries all seemed designed, in part, to send a message to China: "We're on their side." While Obama and his aides have been quick to dispel the notion this week's trip amounted to a "containment tour," the President's announcements throughout his visit — mostly military in nature — made clear the White House knew Beijing was watching closely. Before Obama even landed in Tokyo he'd taken Japan's side in its bitter spat with China over a set of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea — suggesting the United States would lend support to Japan should the squabble escalate militarily. Obama begins Asia tour with reassurance to Japan A week later, the White House announced the United States and the Philippines would enter into a new defense pact that allows for more American troops in Southeast Asia — interpreted by China as an attempt to balance its own presence in a region where land and water are in constant dispute. Obama denied that was the intention of the agreement. "Our goal is not to counter China, our goal is not to contain China," he said in Manila. But more troops in the region will undoubtedly be some deterrent against any Chinese incursion into contested waters. For the first time since the 1990s, when American bases were closed in the Philippines, the United States will have a substantial military footprint there. And that's no accident, say experts who predict the next major world crisis will unfold off of China's coast. "This is a region that's going to be on the boil for years and years to come," said Robert Kaplan, the chief geopolitical analyst for Stradfor, on CNN this week. "Seas crowded with warships, submarines, merchant shipping, fifth generation fighter jets — that can easily create incidents that in turn could enable a crisis."	1
Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race. A crowd protests the court ruling upholding Proposition 8 in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies have asked a federal judge to block California from enforcing the ban, known as Proposition 8. "We are two lawyers from opposite ends of the political spectrum who have come together to support one of the most important issues of our time," Olson told reporters. The case "is not about liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican. We're here in part to symbolize that," he added. Wednesday's lawsuit was filed on behalf of two same-sex couples who have been denied marriage licenses under Proposition 8. A federal judge in San Francisco has set a July 2 hearing on the matter.  Watch the next fight about marriage » "Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law," Boies said. "There is no right more fundamental than the right to marry the person you love and to raise a family."  Watch more on the same-sex marriage battle in California » Olson was the lead attorney for George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida recount. Boies, meanwhile, was the top legal strategist for former Vice President Al Gore, that year's Democratic presidential nominee. California's Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the marriage ban Tuesday, but left intact about 18,000 same-sex marriages conducted before voters approved the ban in November. The court rejected arguments that the measure improperly amended the state constitution. In another echo of past political battles, one of those who argued in favor of Proposition 8 was Kenneth Starr -- the special prosecutor who led the Whitewater investigation that led to the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The lawsuit is backed by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a newly formed organization based in Los Angeles.  See iReporter photos of protests, celebrities » But a coalition of groups that fought the ban in California courts -- including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and the Lambda Legal Foundation -- urged supporters Wednesday to turn their energy toward winning in the political arena rather than the courts.	1
"We were shouting for help, but nobody listened," said Muhammad Iqbal about the slaying of his pregnant 25-year-old wife, Farzana Parveen, at the hands of her relatives, who gathered  for a wedding at their apartment in a Pakistani village in the remote southwestern region of Balochistan. Farzana's husband, the 27-year-old Muhammad Jilani, was away at a friend's house for the wedding. He returned to find that Farzana had been brutally beaten with a rod and then killed.Iqbal said he had only returned by chance to pick up Farzana at the couple's home in Thatta district in Balochistan, a port city with a large, often-violent, Baloch population. He said he had never met Muhammad Jilani.After the slaying, Iqbal said he tried to call his wife in Karachi and tell her to come home with him, but she could not answer since she was not at her home when he got there. He said Muhammad Jilani's cousin, who was the one who killed Farzana, returned to the village and told her family that her husband had killed Farzana. They took Farzana's body to its resting place in the village of Qadu and buried it as someone else had done."After the wedding, I found Farzana lying on the floor unconscious," said Iqbal. "When I asked her about what had happened, she replied that she had just gone to bed and fallen asleep, and a few minutes later she was found dead," he said.Iqbal said there was no other witness to the murder. "I saw the faces of the people who were involved in the murder myself," he said.Iqbal and Farzana had been married for more than three years, and in the last two of those three years she had grown pregnant. Iqbal said he did not know about her pregnancy when he married her, or about her pregnancy, when he married Nausheen, whom he also married within a short period of time.During their marriage, Iqbal and Farzana got into a physical fight, and they did not get along at the end of their first year. "What happened was that she could not bear being pregnant, and when she found out about that she kicked me, called	0
The figure peers down silently from an upper floor of the ruins of a Scottish castle, wearing what looks like an outfit from the Middle Ages. Could this be a long-dead Scottish earl, or just a random, modern-day visitor?  A local man in a cowboy hat and flannel jacket seems to agree with what he sees.  The woman holds an old, leather-bound book. She is the only person in the room. And she is the only person in Scotland who has been here in centuries.  "It's the Book of Kells," she says, and her voice drifts across the room. "Do you know its origins?"  The man in the cowboy hat and flannel jacket says, "Not really. We've tried to learn. But I've never seen anything like it."  _She's a prophet. She speaks for the dead. Her words come from beyond the grave. She speaks as the spirit who holds the key to everything._—from a story attributed to J.R.R.

Former Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday, leaving his voters up for grabs. Former Sen. John Edwards ended his presidential bid Wednesday. The race for the Democratic nomination is now down to Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. "I think both candidates will benefit in the short term, but long-term, the candidate who talks about the plight of the poor, that champions the middle class, that talks about trade and health care ... will benefit from the support of John Edwards and, of course, the people who back him," CNN political analyst Donna Brazile said. Senior Edwards aides said Edwards called Clinton and Obama to tell them he was considering dropping out of the race and asked them to make poverty a central issue of the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do. Edwards, who had collected 26 delegates, did not plan to endorse Clinton or Obama yet, but he may do so in the future, an aide said.  Watch Edwards explain his decision » An endorsement from Edwards would have a significant impact on the race,  Democratic strategist Peter Fenn said.  Check out the analysis by CNN's political team » "You could make an argument that the change issue does benefit Barack Obama, that he picks up that support. You could also make the argument that there's a lot of support out there amongst people that will go to Hillary," he said. "The big issue here is who will he endorse." Some political pundits predict Edwards' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama's direction.  Watch analyst Mark Halperin explain endorsement possibilities » "The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them, and in some places, that makes a huge difference," former presidential adviser David Gergen said. Time magazine journalist Joe Klein said, "I don't think he endorses Hillary Clinton. The question is whether or not he endorses Barack Obama." Klein contends Clinton "represents a lot of the things that [Edwards] campaigned against, you know, the old Washington Democratic establishment that he believes got too close to the corporations in the '90s." Edwards had campaigned on the message that he was standing up for the little guy, the people who are not traditionally given a voice in Washington, and that he would do more to fight special interests.	1
Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday. The arrests on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday followed the discovery of two guns and a small amount of ammunition hidden in a car stopped by police last weekend who believed it was uninsured, the police said. The news comes as Britain is in a state of heightened security ahead of the London Olympics, which open in three weeks. On Thursday, armed police in Staffordshire closed a major highway and called in bomb disposal squads when a passenger on a bus raised the alarm over smoke coming from a fellow traveler's bag. The source turned out to be a quit-smoking aid, and no arrests were made. Police in London also arrested six people Thursday on suspicion of committing, planning or instigating terror offenses. Those arrests were not related to the Olympic or Paralympic Games, police said. The arrests announced Friday involve six men from the West Midlands, all in their 20s, and a 43-year-old man from West Yorkshire. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? The seven men have been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, a police statement said. Detective Chief Supt. Kenny Bell of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: "As soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved." The firearms, which were not loaded when they were found, are being tested, and police are searching a number of addresses, the statement said. No information has yet been given on the motivation of the suspects. However, it is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London. Following these arrests the UK Home Office website has not changed the terror threat level from "substantial," which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is "severe," which means an attack is "highly likely," and the highest is "critical," meaning an attack is "expected imminently." Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics. They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London. Police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts.	1
Late 90s Beijing. Those were the days. Forgive the wistful opening but it's true. The saccharine pop hit "Xin Tai Ruan" may have played endlessly on the radio and the "Titanic" screensaver displayed on virtually every cubicle PC, but I forgive the kitsch of that era. It was a time before China became a top destination for resume-wielding MBAs. And it was a time of intellectual exchange between curious locals and sinophile expats, each drawn by a strong mutual interest in culture, music, and emerging technology. In circa 1997 Beijing, there was no relentless gridlock or constant smartphone use to prevent free and open exploration in the real world. And there were only 620,000 Internet users across the entire country. This was the dawn of dot-coms in China. Cigarettes and instant noodles When I couldn't land my dream job as a full-time reporter in Beijing, I took up a post with a fledgling Chinese Internet firm I had covered as a freelancer. That start-up would later grow into Sohu, one of China's leading Internet companies. Its original one-room office in the Bright China Chang An Building was spartan to say the least. Forget the gourmet canteens of Baidu today. Seventeen years ago, the dotcom diet in Beijing was MSG-laced instant noodles and cigarettes at your desk. I was the only Western woman in the company and one of a few thousand Western expats in the city. If you were an expat in pre-World Trade Organization China, you were probably there because of a genuine interest in the country and its culture. We weren't there to exploit the economic opportunity of a so-called rising China. We were just there for an adventure. Dotcom game In 1999, I met fellow American expat Porter Erisman for dinner while he was leading the Internet marketing group at Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing. He was curious about jumping into the China dotcom game and wanted to know more about what it was like. I recently caught up with Porter to reminisce about that time and learn more about why he decided to take that risk and join a Chinese Internet start-up.	1
Iran executed a man in a rare public hanging in Tehran on Wednesday morning, local media reported. The man, identified only as "Yaqub," was convicted of stabbing a man to death in broad daylight in October, said the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The public hanging, which was attended by the victims' family and large crowds of onlookers, took place in the main square of the affluent northern Tehran neighborhood of Sa'adat Abad. The October murder sparked outrage amongst Tehran residents after videos of the stabbing surfaced on the Internet and were replayed on Iranian state television. The killing took place in front of two police officers, the news agency said. Although executions are common in Iran, public ones are not. A death sentence can be handed down for crimes from murder to adultery. The latest execution brings the total number this year to 20, according to a CNN count from local media reports. On Monday, Iranian authorities hanged seven convicted drug traffickers in the city of Kermanshah, the news agency said. Amnesty International says Iran only trails China in the number of executions worldwide.	1
A Wisconsin woman who said she agreed to cook and clean for a man she met on the internet in exchange for a free place to stay allegedly ended up as his sex slave, prosecutors said Wednesday. The 27-year-old woman met New York resident John Hopkins on the website Craigslist before spending nine days trapped in his apartment, where she claims she was repeatedly raped, according to a district attorney's statement. The woman -- whose name has not been released -- was treated for injuries at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The details of her condition are not clear. Authorities charged Hopkins with rape, assault, forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment, arresting him at his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday. He is currently being held on $350,000 bail. The woman claims that she was looking for work in New York and found an advertisement that Hopkins posted on Craigslist, listing a room for rent, according to the complaint. The pair agreed that the woman could stay rent free if she cooked and cleaned for Hopkins, who then paid for her airfare to New York on February 4, 2011. Upon arriving at his apartment, Hopkins allegedly told the woman that she was going to be his slave, the complaint said. The woman claims she was repeatedly raped between February 4 and February 12, and was also tied with a rope, gagged and handcuffed to a radiator, it said. On the ninth day, she said she managed to call her mother and alert her of the alleged abuse. Police found the woman bruised and bound in Hopkins' apartment, according to the district attorney statement. Authorities said the victim was shaking and had marks on her body, according to the complaint. Hopkins is expected to appear in court Friday for a preliminary hearing. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison.	1
A California transit officer shot and killed another officer Tuesday in an incident that Ã¢ÂÂshocksÃ¢ÂÂ the entire country because of the officerÃ¢ÂÂs age, the department said.The officer was identified as Lt. Ryan D. Bailey, who was shot in the abdomen after he had Ã¢ÂÂcocked his arm up as if to draw a weapon,Ã¢ÂÂ according to a statement from the San Francisco Police Department.The officer who was shot, identified as Lt. Richard J. Solomon, 40, was a 20-year veteran of the department, police said. In addition to being a police officer, Solomon was a veteran of the United States Marine Corps.It was not immediately clear what happened in the confrontation, which happened in the station located on a street in the cityÃ¢ÂÂs Mission District. The San Francisco Police Officers Association said the officers were attempting to arrest a woman who had run out of the station and threatened to jump off the roof.Solomon also had an older brother who was killed in a traffic accident, the union said.Police received reports that the woman had threatened the officers with a knife and tried to throw herself off the roof of the station. It was not immediately clear how the women gained entry to the station.The shooting occurred about 12:30 p.m. and the woman with the knife was arrested, police said.San Francisco police officers are Ã¢ÂÂconstantly under hostile assaultÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂon-duty deaths have become the norm,Ã¢ÂÂ Chief Greg Suhr said.

HP has announced a major new initiative and a slew of new devices that enable users to print from any device to a web-enabled printer by simply using e-mail. The idea -- which builds off the Google Cloud Print announcement we saw back in April -- Âis simple: when you receive an e-mail attachment, click on it, and print it using the device you'd like to print from.So far, so good, right? Except when you start using it.I've printed a few times from Gmail, the iPhone and Windows Mobile and have had a few different devices come up with different problems that are either due to bugs or the new setup. One minor issue is that my Mac, a Dell, has a default printer that's configured to print using a local Windows account, so you can't just point it to "Epson-Epson-Epson" but have to go through the process of setting up a new account. If you're using "Epson-Epson-Epson" for the account and just want to print to a PIXMA MX700, you get the following error message:This problem was easy to solve, in that the MX700 didn't use the default account. It also solved a minor annoyance in that after printing, it takes a few seconds to load the document into Chrome.So what's the big deal?The big deal is that what HP is hoping to accomplish is to provide printer functionality that Google isn't offering. For example, Google Cloud Print offers you a single login point, but even though you can have as many printers as you'd like to "print" from, you can only manage them using this one account. The company also doesn't integrate into popular browser plugins, like Firefox's add-ons. The "print from any device to a web-enabled printer" feature is also not one-touch, but instead requires the use of 3rd-party apps.It's an interesting proposition. I'm a little skeptical but may have to try it if I've got a few friends coming out to visit. I also wonder if HP is doing it just to cash in on the printing services offered by PIXMA printers. PIXMA, a company based in Japan, is a big, big proponent of 3D printing, including a lot of 3D printing in their printers. If they're going to go down that road, why	0
Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia. SurfAid had shipped 1,000 shelter kits to victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said Thursday. The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, she said. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. "It's very difficult" to reach the region either by boat or road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid. The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies. The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia. An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said. "The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there," said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures. Monday's quake generated a "significant" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said.	1
David Letterman told his audience Thursday that he is the victim of an alleged extortion attempt and admitted to having sexual relations with several members of his staff, according to a press release from his production company. David Letterman admitted to having sexual relationships with female staff members, his company says. Letterman made the announcement during taping of the "Late Show." "This morning, I did something I've never done in my life," Letterman told his audience, according to a release from Worldwide Pants Inc. "I had to go downtown and testify before a grand jury." The 62-year-old funnyman said he received a package three weeks ago from a person who claimed to have information about Letterman's sexual dalliances, ultimately demanding $2 million to prevent public revelation. Letterman said he went to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which conducted an investigation, and an arrest was made earlier Thursday. In his grand jury testimony, Letterman said, he revealed the relations with members of his staff. "My response to that is, yes I have," he said. "Would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would. I feel like I need to protect these people -- I need to certainly protect my family." It is not known when the sexual encounters with staffers took place. Letterman married long-time partner Regina Lasko in March. The couple, who have been together since 1986, have a son, Harry, 6. Letterman has been host of "Late Show with David Letterman" on CBS since 1993 after leaving NBC, where he was host of "Late Night with David Letterman" for 11 years. "Late Show" airs at 11:30 p.m. "Late Night" aired an hour later.	1
Egypt on Tuesday deported an American anti-war activist who was trying to travel to the Gaza Strip. Medea Benjamin, who co-founded the Code Pink anti-war group, said she was detained on arrival at Cairo airport Monday evening. She had planned to join a delegation of activists on a visit to the Palestinian coastal enclave this week. She told CNN she was assaulted by airport police, resulting in her arm being broken and shoulder dislocated, before being put on a flight to Istanbul on Tuesday. "I was never told why I was arrested. I was detained as soon as I arrived and I was violently assaulted in prison," she said by phone on arrival in Turkey. "My arm is broken. I did not do anything wrong. No reason was given for my arrest." She spoke briefly as she said she was on her way to a hospital. She said she was deported despite Egyptian doctors saying she was not fit to fly. An official from Egypt's Interior Ministry communications department said Benjamin had not been detained. "She was denied entry, not detained. There's a big difference," Brigadier Alaa Mahmoud told CNN. "There is no legal basis to detain her." He said she had stated her reason for visiting as a trip to Gaza, but authorities explained to her that the crossing was closed and consequently refused to allow her to enter the country. He denied any use of force or assault. He also said that he had no information on whether Benjamin had been banned from Egypt. Benjamin chronicled the events on Twitter. Heckling Obama Last May, she famously interrupted President Barack Obama as he gave a speech on counterterrorism policy, repeatedly urging him to take faster action in releasing detainees from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Members of the group have previously interrupted congressional hearings and official speeches. On its website, Code Pink said it was sending a U.S. delegation of 15 women to join a larger coalition that would travel to Gaza. It said they would meet in Cairo on March 5 and attempt to travel to Gaza from there. "Due to the political and security issues in Egypt, there are no guarantees that we will be able to get into Gaza," the group said. Israel and Egypt restrict the flow of goods into the coastal territory, which is ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas, designated as a terrorist group by Israel and Western countries. On Tuesday, a Cairo court banned all activities by Hamas in Egypt, calling it a terrorist organization.	1
Travelers don't always have to fight the masses and schlep overseas to find exotic vacation thrills. Safari West near Sonoma, California,  offers a taste of Africa in North America. If you know where to look, you can find  elephants, rhinos, lions, and other exotic animals in the surrounding park.The best way to see these animals is usually in a group with other humans. To get a sense of the crowds, take in your first trip as a solo traveller, then come back for a second visit at a later date.### How to GoMost visitors arrive at the park by bus. The Sonoma State Historic Park is located on the north side of Highway 101 from San Francisco to Santa Rosa. Take Hwy. 101 north from any of the three Sonoma County towns: Sebastopol, the capital city of Sonoma County, is just a mile away; the county seat of unincorporated Sonoma County is also just a couple miles away; or the tourist town of Healdsburg, in the northern part of the Bay Area, makes a good overnight stop.Before you get off the bus, ask where you should board — there are no public restrooms at the visitor center area.### ExploringThe best place to start is the Sonoma State Historic Park, located just off Highway 101 between Healdsburg and Sebastopol. The park is open daily from 8:00 AM to sunrise and from 10:00 PM to dusk. The park is a short drive from the Healdsburg visitor center.The park is actually a three-block loop of sites that were once filled with the original buildings and a number of small buildings that were built between the late 1930s and the early 1950s. This is the oldest surviving collection of buildings in Sonoma County. The loop has a variety of museums and exhibits, a historical museum, and a bookstore.A self-guided historical walking tour of the three-block loop is a great way to get a feel for the area. Many of the buildings and sites still have their original signage. You must be dressed in period clothing, and if you want to do some of the buildings, you're required to buy a program with the ticket.The site where you start your history walk can be a problem. After the two-story log building, you first come to the cemetery. The cedar cemeter	0
Martian rock N165, it's your time to shine, or glow, or whatever occurs when a hard substance gets zapped by a laser beam. From about 10 feet away, the Mars rover  MER roars past in a single blur of motion, a single, giant color photograph. In one frame, the rover's wheels make their first long jump across the surface, one after the other, from one flat spot in the dust to another, then over again, the whole process taking about an hour in total. It's kind of a strange sight, but then again, the Curiosity Rover is the strangest.This is the first time that the rover has ever moved, in any sense of the word, and it shows just how much of a technological marvel it is, even as it reveals just how much it has to learn — or, rather, how much it needs to learn to do its job. To move an object of this size — this vast, heavy, very stiff thing — requires a whole bunch of stuff: wheels and tracks, a power plant, valves and pumps for the water and oxygen, and the brains to make sense of the data streaming in from the rovers' instruments, most of which is written in the ancient, old-fashioned kind that's more legible than most people are comfortable with.But even as we witness the first long jumps, and the first dust-clearing, and the first science, and the first rovers, and the first images, the first moments of the rover’s existence start to show in some of the more telling numbers. We can measure its age, by the distance from the rover that its wheels have climbed since its launch on Nov. 26, 2011. The rover is a long way from Mars now, and the first thing that you have to realize is that it won’t ever be anywhere close to Mars again. But as the distance gets shorter, and the path gets straighter and straighter, the clock started ticking at a point on the ground that will only ever get moved again, one small step at a time.Of course, we don’t know how long it will take to get to Mars. It might take only a few hours. The rover is currently stuck on a sand beach called Unit 2, which sits about the size of four soccer fields and is more than 1 mile wide. But there’s a chance it could end up	0
This week, just over 250 days since the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan and inclusive bill to extend the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives allowed the clock to run out on Â and instead voted to kill the bill in a dramatic floor action on Friday.To be clear, this is not a Republican-only issue. The Democratic House leadership stood by the VAWA bill and voted affirmatively on the floor on Thursday. In the Senate, the bill passed 67-28, with three Republicans joining all but six Democrats to vote yes.VAWA's passage is notable for two reasons. First, it is a bipartisan compromise that received bipartisan support. Second, it is a bill that has bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle.Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-TX) spoke after the bill was passed in the Senate on November 13, 2015, and wrote this powerful paragraph in her statement, which she had just sent to her constituents:Today, we are celebrating the passing of the VAWA reauthorization Act. The Act passed the Senate in November 2015 and will now be brought to the House for consideration. This legislation reauthorizes and extends the Violence Against Women Act for 5 years. It does this by: (1) Establishing a national conference to develop VAWA-inspired policies and procedures for the safety and well-being of survivors of domestic and sexual violence; (2) Expanding the definition of intimate partner violence to include any physical, sexual, or mental abuse perpetrated by a partner or family or household member against a current or former spouse, intimate partner; or child, elder or dependent adult; and (3) Increasing the maximum amount of compensation for victims of intimate partner and spousal abuse from $5,000 to $50,000. In addition, it will create an expanded sexual assault prevention program for federal employees and military personnel, and require training of federal criminal justice system personnel on how to identify and report perpetrators of sexual assault. This action would provide an additional 5 years of protection for up to 20 million victims of sexual assault.The VAWA bill was a bipartisan compromise in the House of Representatives that earned broad support from all segments of the community. But with the Senate now moving closer to action, it fell to the House to move the bill, and it did so with remarkable unanimity.From the beginning	0
Creigh Deeds remembers turning his back just before his son attacked him, stabbing the Virginia state senator multiple times. Deeds had gone out to the barn to feed the horses. His son, Austin "Gus" Deeds, came  from the other side of the barn and stabbed him, the senior senator said.He says he had no way to defend himself, that he only had to turn his back and Gus Deeds came charging in."He just walked in and he stabbed me several times, and I turned my back."That's when Gus Deeds stabbed him in an apparent drive-by shooting."I was stabbed in the back, back here," Deeds said, pointing to the front.Austin Deeds, who took a plea deal to avoid a potential death sentence, is expected back in court Thursday. Deeds is accused of murdering state Sen. Bryce Reeves, who disappeared while hiking two weeks ago.If convicted, he faces the death penalty if his defense wins.The son who pleaded guilty to murder has not been sentenced and remains free.But in court Thursday morning, prosecutors said he was a violent threat to society, given his guilty plea."Gus Deeds is a violent man and dangerous, and he poses a substantial risk to the community," said Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Steven Brown. "I urge the judge to impose the death sentence."The attack on Deeds came just two weeks after the disappearance of Reeves, a Democrat who was chairman of the legislature's criminal justice committee.Deeds was charged with murder last year, but the case was moved to the capital murder trial to allow the trial to proceed without a jury for an evidentiary hearing.Elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2016, he was elected to fill the last two weeks of the Virginia House seats to finish the year.On Aug. 30, 2016, two weeks into the session, Gov. Terry McAuliffe had to remove Reeves from the governor's race when the then-incumbent did not return a call or respond to messages.The Republican nominee for governor, state Sen. Creigh Deeds, who is also a brother of the jailed son, stepped into the leadership role in the Senate, replacing outgoing Republican Sen. Frank Wagner, who had taken his leave.In recent months, Deeds had also	0
December 16, 2014 was a dark day, not just in our nation's history, but the world's. Young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in Peshawar along with their teachers. It shook a nation that had already seen  many violent clashes between the government and the various different tribes and sects in the country. The incident took place in the Peshawar school on Wednesday, but the exact number of dead is still not yet known. To add to that, the country is still in an uproar about the incident.However, our country has not let this trauma sink in. Our media has been busy reporting this horrific event. It has been a constant stream of drama and horror for days now. It has been a day of hope and despair. And if you look closely, it has not been at all the way we would have hoped for, not the way we expected. We would have expected a lot more from the media and political leaders, yet they kept talking about the incident as if the whole world knew about this as well. They have painted the whole country as the same as the Pakistan media, yet they kept quiet, keeping the news to themselves.Let's go back to Wednesday, January 8, 2011, when the Pakistan Army killed almost 1,100 innocent children in a school for religious reasons in Peshawar, Pakistan. We were at a loss about what exactly happened. But then all the reports kept talking about the shooting spree and killing of students and teachers. We had no information about what kind of children they were. Some had been abducted and taken away in trucks, some had been killed in gun-battles in the streets and some had been murdered in such a manner that we didn't know whether they were alive or dead. In fact, after the shooting incident, the people of Pakistan were shocked to know that the Pakistan Army has killed over a thousand people in this school.Now imagine that the Taliban took over the school in the day after the attack and had massacred dozens of children, then you would understand what kind of atrocities happened in the Peshawar school. The children were shot in the head with automatic weapons and it did not even make a sound. The massacre of this school happened right in the middle of the school. There were not even any adults or children who could survive such a massacre. We could not even understand how Pakistan would allow such an attack to take place in the school.But instead of	0

Five men are accused of starting a massive Malibu wildfire at that destroyed more than 50 homes and forced about 15,000 people to evacuate. A second firefighter dies when his truck caught fire in the blaze. An officer with the Malibu Police was found dead after his patrol car was torched in a fire. Hisbody was found underneath his vehicle. Firefighters had to return to the scene of a blaze early Sunday morning, as the wind had changed directions. The area was later declared a disaster area by Los Angeles County authorities. There is no information on how the blaze started.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

President Barack Obama on Tuesday expressed hope that Libya's opposition movement, given new protection by a U.S.-led military mission, can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust Moammar Gadhafi from power. In a 13-minute interview with CNN's Spanish-language network, Obama said the immediate goal of the U.N.-sanctioned military mission that began Saturday was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi by Gadhafi's military. "Because the international community rallied, his troops have now pulled back from Benghazi," Obama said. Now the United States and its coalition partners, including NATO allies and Arab states, are establishing a no-fly zone over Libya, with U.S. forces taking out Gadhafi's air defense systems, Obama said. He conceded that Gadhafi could "hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no-fly zone, even though his forces have been degraded." "Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they're able to organize themselves, how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people," Obama said. "Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago," but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi, can now resurface, the president said. In particular, Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power. The president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but said the goal in this case was humanitarian. "I'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander-in-chief but also somebody who aspires to peace," Obama said, adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi's military. "We're not invading a country; we are not acting alone," he said. "We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council." The American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and "who wants to make sure people aren't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power,"Obama added.	1

An Orlando, Florida, airport official wants to join the small group of U.S. airports who use a private company to screen passengers instead of the Transportation Security Administration. Larry Dale, president  of Orlando International Airport, said the private company, United Private Security, screens fewer passengers than the TSA does, but that it is cost-efficient if he pays for the additional screening.Mr. Dale said he would make $2.5 million annually from the contract if TSA would cover the cost of screening passengers and baggage. He said he would screen the passengers himself, but that he would rather do so "because it's worth more money to me."Mr. Dale said that he would "give a good enough screening" and that his system would not have the same problems as TSA does, such as the false alarms that TSA has experienced with its X-ray machines. He said that TSA "would take the opportunity to put their people back in charge and they would be happy to do that."At the same time, Mr. Dale said he "wouldn't be opposed to TSA having their own people in charge."Mr. Dale said: "I would not be opposed to TSA having their own people in charge."This is from the Orlando Sentinel:The controversy over the use of privately owned, TSA-approved screening machines at Orlando International Airport started months ago, but intensified during the first few weeks of the new year as some travelers became more vocal in their complaints about the technology.A few dozen airport travelers took to an internal email list, The Orlando Sentinel's Travel Coverage blog, which has been viewed more than 4,000 times. The group has gathered at least 4,000 signatures for a petition calling for the TSA to return to the screening of passengers and their luggage.Travelers said the machines are unreliable."It is an inferior system. It is inaccurate. It is useless. It is a waste of money and resources. And it does not actually guarantee safety," said one. "I would not be in the airport without it."Two of the travelers said they would rather be screened by TSA, which they called a credible screening system.The "disruption" the TSA has caused at the Orlando International Airport started a month ago during the transition between TSA and the privately owned, TSA-approved screening system. At the same time, at least five people have suffered potentially serious	0
Six Zimbabweans arrested last year for watching footage of the Arab Spring protests were found guilty Monday of conspiracy to commit public violence. The men face six to 10 years in prison or a $2,000 fine when they are sentenced in a Ã¢ÂÂZanu PartyÃ¢ÂÂ court at the end of April.In what is the first such verdict against anti-government protesters, the court said the defendants were guilty of Ã¢ÂÂcommitting public violence,Ã¢ÂÂ in the form of watching and collecting information about the protests.The Zimbabwean ruling party, Zanu, has been in charge most of the past six years, but the country has been struggling with a severe economic crisis.The verdicts come as international outrage grows over the wave of Zimbabwean anti-government protests that have swept the land-locked African country. Three of the men are believed to be in Europe.This news is also disturbing considering the fact that, as The Independent notes, Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world.At least 200 people have been killed in the crisis.According to local media reports, most of the victims were killed by security forces.According to a report by Amnesty International in March, Zimbabwe has the highest rate of violent deaths in the world, with the government citing a lack of human and economic resources as a reason for allowing the protests.Since 2008 when the Zanu-led government won uncontested elections, Mugabe has been criticized for a number of human rights issues.For example, he has been criticized for police brutality and the deaths of at least 15 people in 2010 during anti-government protests.The US State Department has condemned the state’s “inhumane repression” and its treatment of human rights activists and opposition politicians.“The United States continues to be disturbed by the recent events in Zimbabwe,” a spokeswoman told reporters. “We are appalled by the reports of torture and killings of both civilians, including women and children, and members of the opposition party.”Zimbabwe is struggling with high levels of poverty, and corruption is widespread. Zanu’s first electoral victory was marred by allegations of vote-rigging.In an interview with BBC last year when	0
The screech of clear, heavy-duty duct tape scratches on the ear even before the mass of mainland Chinese visitors comes into view. This is the daily soundtrack from thousands of people packing up brown cardboard boxes outside   Zhuhai City, a city that hosts two major cities: the ancient, walled city of Luoyang and the modern, modern town of Zhuhai.   It is, in a sense, the reverse of the "China tourist trail"—a very strange journey indeed.##   The Luoyang City TourYou can get to the city by taxi or by your hotel bus to the main city bus station. It's cheaper to just take the city bus rather than an airport-bus combination ride. In Luoyang City, the main bus station is the one place where you can purchase a bus ticket directly, and it's open 24 hours a day.In Zhuhai City, you have a choice between bus and train to the main bus station from various train stations. You'll also find train and bus services from the main Zhuhai City Station to the other major cities and towns.The bus schedule is much slower than the train schedule, and if you don't already have a ticket to the city, the bus will be the only option. It may be quicker to take a train to Zhuhai, although on the whole, my experience has been that it's not as comfortable. The train also stops at smaller cities like Huantijiao,   Huantou,   Nanning, and Zhangzhou, so you could make a day of it by taking a train, bus, or air-plane.##   The Zhuhai City TourThe bus to Zhuhai is direct.   The train is slower, but it's an interesting journey through the rural countryside.#   The Luoyang City TourThe   main city bus station   has a huge number of buses, trains, and taxis running from just about anywhere in every direction; it serves several cities and towns. It also serves as the main center for the city's many hotels, museums, and cultural sites.##   The Zhuhai City Tour##   The Luoy	0
Should a sporting event be allowed to continue if a key participant dies during competition? Golf's European Tour insisted it should be following the death of Alastair Forsyth's caddie Iain McGregor on  the seventh day of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Champions when he was hit by a ball.The Tour announced on Thursday it had taken down the word "withdrawn" from its website."In the wake of the tragic death of Iain McGregor, the E.G.T. wishes to make it clear that the withdrawal is temporary and we will be monitoring the process closely," it said.Forsyth, who was a father-of-two, died of a brain bleed in the golf club's players' lounge after taking a break from the tournament."We deeply regret the tragedy this morning and are very saddened by the news of the death of our caddie and friend, Alastair Forsyth. His loss is felt by us all - his family, his Golf Club and E.G.T. staff and the local community. We offer our sincere and deepest condolences to his family and to the golfer community," the E.G.T. said in a statement.Forsyth, who worked for the E.G.T from the start of his career 12 years ago, had been in Abu Dhabi on business when he collapsed and was hospitalised.His family said he was "very ill" before he died.The Abu Dhabi golf tournament is scheduled to run until April 1.A spokesman for the golf's governing body said Mr Forsyth had been replaced by three other employees at the tournament's halfway stage, with another eight players joining him in the players' lounge after that."We just spoke with him a few minutes ago and just wanted to pass on his deepest thanks and thanks for his years of service to the E.G.T. and the golf community in Abu Dhabi," said the E.G.T. spokesman, Mark Ralston."This has been a very sad week for the sport but we want to thank Alastair for his professionalism and his service to the golfing community here."But Mr Forsyth's family said their thoughts were with the people of Abu Dhabi."I'm sorry to say Alastair died today at the end of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Champions," said his daughter	0
The son of actor Michael Landon was found dead in his West Hollywood, California, home Monday afternoon, according to investigators. There was "no indication of foul play" in the death of Mark Landon, 60, according to the report from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Mark Landon was the son of Dodie Frasier, who married Michael Landon in 1956. The actor adopted the child and his younger brother. Mark Landon had a few acting credits, playing small roles in three movies, according to the Internet Movie Database. He played a cab driver in "Us," a film his father directed and starred in just before his death from cancer in 1991. Michael Landon was once one of Hollywood's biggest TV stars. He is best known for his 14 years as "Little Joe" Cartwright in TV's long-running "Bonanza," and later as Charles Ingalls in nine seasons of "Little House on the Prairie." CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.	1
Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow was enjoying a pint at his local pub in the Scottish Highlands when he got an idea that would change his life -- and the lives of thousands of others. It was 1992, and MacFarlane-Barrow and his brother Fergus had just seen a news report about refugee camps in Bosnia. The images of people suffering in the war-torn country shocked the two salmon farmers, who'd visited there as teenagers and remembered the warmth of the Bosnian people. "We began saying 'Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just do one small thing to help?' " MacFarlane-Barrow says. After talking it over, the two men took a week off work and collected food, clothing, medicine and blankets. They loaded everything into an old Land Rover, drove to Bosnia to deliver it and returned to Scotland. "I came back here thinking that I did my one good deed and it would be back to work, but it [didn't work] out like that, " he says. When they arrived home, the brothers found an avalanche of goods that people had continued to donate while they were away. "I was touched by the overwhelming generosity of others," MacFarlane-Barrow remembers. "I saw all of those donations in our family home and thought, 'Wow, people really are good,' and it inspired me to be good too." After much thought and prayer, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow quit his job, sold his home and dedicated himself to helping people in need. He returned to Bosnia with aid 22 more times during the Bosnian War, and over the next 18 years his work expanded and evolved. Today, his program -- Mary's Meals, named after the Virgin Mary -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world. MacFarlane-Barrow found his current focus in 2002 while working in Malawi -- a country ravaged by famine and AIDS -- when he met a local teenager who just wanted a decent meal and an education. "The mother of the family was dying of AIDS. She was lying on her bare mud floor, and she had her six children around her, " he says. "I started talking to her oldest child, Edward. And Edward said, 'I'd like to have enough food to eat. I'd like to go to school one day.' "	1
Syria, which has long accused Arab and Western satellite news networks for fabricating and falsifying events, now has CNN in its sights. State-run Syrian media asserted Thursday that CNN journalists were involved in blowing up an oil pipeline in Homs province, collaborating with "saboteurs." The allegations surfaced when Syrian state TV aired portions of the CNN documentary "72 Hours Under Fire," about the challenges faced by a CNN team while on assignment in Homs. "72 Hours Under Fire": Life and death under Syria's onslaught Rafiq Lutf, described as a member of the Arab Journalists Union in America, asked on the program: "Who is behind the attack? It is one particular group. Who is this group? Let (CNN) answer this question. It's one of two things. It is either that they are the perpetrators. ... But I guarantee to you that they are the accomplices." The anchor talking with Lutf spoke of "conclusive evidence of the involvement of CNN and the American journalists who were present there in the detonation of the oil pipelines in Homs." Syria's state news agency SANA picked up the theme Friday, writing that the footage "revealed that the camera operators were CNN correspondents who entered Syria illegally through the Lebanese borders and seemed to have coordinated with the saboteurs to film a video of the attack and send it to their channel." SANA also reported that CNN claimed the "Syrian army was behind the attack to deflect suspicion of any coordination, if not to say involvement, with the terrorist saboteurs." Tony Maddox, executive vice president and managing director of CNN International, called the assertions "ridiculous." "We stand firmly behind our excellent reporting on Syria," he said. "It is a pity that its citizens did not get to see this important documentary without these ridiculous interventions." Among other allegations made on the program, Lutf asked whether American media outlets were working with al Qaeda, which he linked to the Free Syrian Army resistance. "Why are they now working with al Qaeda?" he asks. "I lived in America for 16 years, and I know the Americans are good people." There have been other unlikely claims by Syrian state media against what they see as international conspiracies against the regime. A state TV anchor said Al-Jazeera, the Arabic-language news network, "depended on armed individuals, the terrorists as correspondents."	1
The sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court Tuesday. The decision is not part of a half-dozen other appeals pending at the Supreme Court. The justices could decide this week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or soon â€¦ to hear the merits of the cases brought by the Democratic state attorneys general in the ongoing battle over the law.The justices are considering whether the law’s requirement that all Americans carry health insurance, or else pay a penalty, is constitutional. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees the federal courts in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, ruled that the requirement is constitutional.Here’s a quick survey of what happened:Health care’s new battleThe appeals court upheld the law in an opinion penned by conservative Chief Judge Emilio Garza of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The opinion was joined by four other court appointees: conservative Judge David T. Ni{\”z}utas of Houston, Judge David Sentelle of Mobile, Alabama, and Judges Diana Gonzalez-Velasquez of Houston and Stephen F. Williams of Dallas.The opinion was joined by four judges because of the unusual nature of the case. All the judges agreed that the law’s mandate to buy health insurance was constitutional, but disagreed about the constitutionality of a separate requirement that people carrying insurance pay a penalty if they don’t carry it.The court said that while a case-by-case analysis is required to decide whether a law actually impacts a constitutional right, the courts are duty bound to ask whether it would Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or should Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be constitutional in an abstract sense.This Ã¢â‚¬â€œ abstraction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ standard was first established in a 1965 Supreme Court opinion, in a case involving a New York statute that required all residents to register with the state, even those without the means to pay for a license. Justice Hugo Black wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The constitutionality of the law is the ultimate issue in this case, and its validity must depend on a constitutional interpretation. But whether that interpretation be or be not wrong	0
Liz Cheney, whose upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi sparked warfare in the Republican Party and within her own family, is dropping out of the primary race, she said on Monday. "Serious health issues have recently arisen in our  family," Cheney said in a statement to The Associated Press. "I have made the very difficult but all-too-welcome decision to step aside temporarily from my campaign and return home to help my family." The statement did not specify where Cheney would return, or when she would go.And so, this news came as a shock to those who closely followed the rancher from his days as a rising star in the Republican Party through to his more recent troubles with his wife's drug abuse and subsequent legal troubles regarding her role in the White House's Energy Department. Enzi, who has been a supporter of Cheney and her husband, former vice president Dick Cheney, has been a staunch supporter of immigration laws and, in particular, of President Donald Trump's plans to build a wall on the southern border. Despite that support, Cheney was considered the race's clear frontrunner when he announced his candidacy last June without endorsing anyone, and was the presumptive nominee from the outset. He will now have to try to regroup and start preparing for his re-election bid."This is a tough decision for Liz, her family and all Wyomingites," said Governor Matt Mead, Wyoming's Republican chairman, in a statement. "I fully respect Liz's decision." Enzi, for his part, has said he was surprised by Cheney's decision and said he would not comment on it. "I have a lot of thoughts on why I am running and some questions on why Liz isn't," he told the AP on Monday. "I'm just going to let this process unfold."This is a tough decision for Liz, her family and all Wyomingites. I fully respect Liz's decision. — Governor Matt Mead (@GovMeadOH) August 31, 2019Enzi had already secured the support of the state's Republican leadership, as well as key members of his state senate delegation, including Sen. Kevin Kealy and Reps. John Sirota and Tom Campbell. Wyoming's attorney general, Tim Fox, was also an early supporter, and has remained one as the primary battle has wound through the months. "When you're sitting with your family on a Friday night in late summer, and you	0
In 1856, British explorer Richard Burton described Somalia as a nation of poets. It may seem an unlikely moniker for a country that has since become defined by piracy, state collapse, and the many horrors unleashed by  the war against terror.But in the summer of 1873, Somalia’s first national poet was murdered.The son of a slave who was sold into debt bondage, and whose only gift from his father was a donkey to carry his coffin, Abdulllah had the misfortune to be a skilled poet, and was renowned for his verse on the horrors of slavery.In a society where the “poetic imagination” was a rare privilege, the 22-year-old poet’s murder remains a mystery today.But the murder of Somali poets was not an isolated tragedy, and the brutal colonial period had its own brutalizing effect in the region. As Somali literature entered a new phase of development, it produced a plethora of poets who were inspired by the themes of struggle and independence.This month marks 20 years since the death of the first Somali poet, Adan Berhna, who was killed in a police raid on his home in October 1971. The poet’s life story was part of that of the many other Somali poets who have been killed since then.Adan Berhna was a young poet, who died when Somali police raided his home in October 1971Today, about 100 years later, the legacy of his body is one that still carries a profound impact. In a country where poetry is still largely unheard of and is often dismissed as irrelevant to the political or cultural dialogue, Berhna’s body carries a deeper message of hope and resistance than many of his generation had.He was buried in the small town of Kafa in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. His final words before he was shot were “I go to the sky”. His poetry is written on land, the sea, and air, and as a young man, he used the language of the people to speak out against injustice.Today, Berhna is remembered as a poet and a freedom fighter. “He was a pioneer,” said Nuh Haq, a journalist and poet, who wrote the definitive biography of the dead poet. “He was an independent thinker.”He was one of a handful	0
While most of the country moves forward on legal protections for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons (LGBT), Republicans in Texas have retrenched their opposition in a shocking manner. The Texas Republican Party adopted a plank in its platform endorsing reparative therapy for gays and lesbians, even though such treatments have been rejected as harmful by all leading medical and psychological associations and even outlawed in some states. Texas Gov. Rick Perry added fuel to the fire by comparing gays and lesbians to alcoholics and refusing to step back from such insulting comments. Perry's views, however, bear further exploration. In his remarks, he used genetic predispositions to make his comparison: "I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that -- and I look at the homosexual issue the same way." At a very superficial level, there is a kernel of truth here. Scientific studies have demonstrated that biology plays a role in one's sexual orientation. Studies of identical twins, who share the same genes, have shown that, if one twin is gay, the other is more likely to be gay, suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics. Scientists also discovered a "fraternal birth order effect": the more male children a woman has, the greater chance that the next one will be gay. The reason for this effect is unknown, but it suggests there may be some change in the mother's body that influences the development of the male fetus. Perhaps the greatest furor over the biological origins of sexual orientation occurred in 1993. Scientist Dean Hamer and others published a study in Science that showed a connection between a particular part of the X chromosome and male homosexuality. Although the study did not find a particular gene, it suggested that such a gene exists on the X chromosome. More recent studies have identified other potential links between homosexuality and genetics, and scientists have offered explanations on how same-sex attraction could advance procreation. Reviewing all the various studies in his 2012 book, "Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation," neuroscientist Simon LeVay concludes that, "taken together, the multitude of research studies published since 1991 have greatly strengthened the idea that biological factors play a significant rule in the development of sexual orientationâ€”in both men and in women."	1
Despite the fact that some of the effects of climate change are still imperceptible to all but the most highly trained eyes, there can be no doubting the alarming picture painted by glacier melt. The iPhone application includes audio, video, slideshows and a documentary film. As these rivers of ice retreat back up the valleys they carved out, so scientists' knowledge of climate change advances, in turn helping us recognize the signs of a warming world. Now a new iPhone app is helping visitors to the Swiss Alps understand how climate change is altering the landscape. Developed by the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland and Swiss software company, Texetera, the Jungfrau Climate Guide is an interactive guide to glaciers and climate change. For a fee of 20 CHF (around $19) visitors to the Jungfrau Alpine region can hire an iPhone loaded with the app. Kaspar Meuli, Head of Communications at the Oeschger Center, told CNN what people can expect from the device. "There are many different levels to the application. Audio pieces -- like the ones you might expect to find in a museum guide which guide you through paths on seven different trails." At different stages along each trail, the phones -- aided by the built-in GPS -- alert visitors to particular points of interest by sounding a yodel. "For example," Meuli explained, "if you are standing in front of a glacier you will be told why it is no longer as big and provided with images of what it looked like 100 years ago, and what it might look like in the future." There are more than 40 audio guides, plus a range of multimedia offerings including videos, slide shows and a documentary film. There are also sections which describe the various flora on the trails along with information on biodiversity. "Everyone who tries it is quite fascinated by it," Meuli said. "People are realizing that climate change is real when they see the consequences." The Jungfrau region is home to the upper and lower Grindelwald glaciers, which have retreated rapidly in recent years. In 2008, the World Glacier Monitoring Service reported that glaciers in some regions of the world were melting away at a rate of more than a meter a year recently.	1
With South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford dominating the news, let's look back at a five other so-called virtuous figures who became embroiled in sex scandals -- and this list just scratches the surface. Jim Bakker  was on the news recently for hosting a sex-fueled rally. Here are the others who are not famous but still scandalous. Note: The names listed below do not necessarily in order of frequency of scandalization.1. Mark Sanford (South Carolina) Mark SanfordAt first glance, you might think the first scandalous figure on the list is a governor who may have taken a few chances himself. But the truth is -- he wasn't the first sex scandal to rock the South Carolina governor's office. You'll notice the most controversial scandal, in terms of media coverage, happened to a former governor of South Carolina, Walter Dalton.Mark Sanford was a popular and highly respected governor of South Carolina whom many considered a symbol of the state. Sanford was first elected in the mid-1970s and soon began his ascent to stardom.When Sanford became governor in 1977, he had served just one term in the state senate. He then won the governorship in a special election the following year.In 1980, Sanford was charged with campaign violations, in particular, misusing campaign money. As he faced prosecution, he resigned from his duties as governor.The scandal was brought out in the media in the early 1990s, as Sanford was about to become a presidential contender, and his popularity began to wane. In 1994, his first year as governor, Sanford was indicted on three counts of perjury and three counts of obstruction of justice.In 1995, the Republican-controlled legislature tried to remove Sanford from office for four months while he was held in custody, but the judge refused.When the legislature voted to replace Sanford as governor in 1996, they stripped him of all his authority. They then replaced him with a Republican, Jim Hodges.In 1997, the state legislature returned control of state government to Sanford. His career was irrevocably damaged in the process. Sanford was forced to resign.In 1998, a former governor's office staffer, Rebecca Markert, went on the record in a book called Markert: The Biography of a Scandal. The scandal was revealed when she admitted to having affairs with more than 20 people, including Sanford. Mark	0
Martin Scorsese's "Hugo" has more nominations, and among the nine contenders for best picture, only "The Tree of Life" has made less money at the box office, but ever since the New York Film Critics  and the British Film Institute announced their results Wednesday, "Hugo" has been the favorite to win, and some say it has edged out Paul Thomas Anderson's "Inherent Vice" and Paul Haggis' "A Time to Kill."Here's a look at the nominees for the 76th Golden Globe Awards:In addition to the top acting and directing categories, which will be honored in Hollywood Sunday night, the Golden Globe Awards will also award acting in television, including the Emmy, Golden Globe, Peabody and British Academy Television Awards.Here are five of the stars of "The Fugitive" who will be honored at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards in Hollywood on Sunday:In the drama category, there are only three films nominated. "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" (directed by Martin Scorsese), "Atonement" (directed by Sam Mendes), and "Gone Baby Gone" (directed by Paul Haggis and starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as a father's battle to save his abducted 7-year-old daughter)."Rendition" is also up for best picture, but the other film, "The Tree of Life," has made just enough money to keep that competition level.If three more filmmakers were to get nominated, "The Tree of Life" could be a tough fight to win.This is the eighth time that Scorsese, Haggis, and Mendes have been nominated for best picture in the award category.Here are the winners of the other categories:BEST ACTOR:Peter Dinklage, "True Grit"Michael Fassbender, "The Ides of March"Bradley Cooper, "American Hustle"Leonardo DiCaprio, "Titanic"Best ACTRESS:Julia Roberts, "Say Anything"Meryl Streep, "The Iron Lady"Viola Davis, "Sandra Bullock: For America"Michelle Williams, "Love & Friendship"Best SUPPORTING ACTOR:Russell Crowe, "Gl	0
The latest person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment is a great-grandmother. Peggy Shannon, 67, who works at the Senior Citizens Service Desk in San Diego City Hall, allegedly faced "continuous ills" including "numbness with pain" when Filner touched her shoulders and other areas of her body during her lunch hour.The woman, who doesn't work for Filner, said the man repeatedly "grabbed" her shoulders, touched her back, neck and legs inappropriately, rubbed his groin on her back then moved his hand to her lower back and upper back.He also allegedly said that he might need a "little help" with "all these elderly ladies" who were walking up and down the hallway, the woman alleged."I thought I was going to pass out but I didn't," said Shannon, a retired truck driver and former Air Force flight instructor. She had lunch with Filner, who is battling cancer.Shannon said she was escorted out of the building Thursday after she declined to give her name in what she described as a "credible complaint."Filner's response? He denied the complaint and accused his accuser of making it up."If Peggy doesn't like my style, she can walk around naked or jump out of windows," Filner told the San Diego Union-Tribune. "But she chose to come forward with this false charge.""It's really funny because I didn't even know that Mr. Filner actually did have these problems," Shannon told the paper. "I found out about it through Facebook and I became aware of it through these allegations."But not everyone was convinced by Filner's response."Somebody who's been out there for 50 years should be able to get some respect," said San Diego resident John M. Dillard.The Union-Tribune reported he is filing a civil suit against Filner. Dillard, who runs a car dealership, told the paper he feels the alleged touching was an attempt to get Filner to resign."I think that's all it was," Dillard told the Union-Tribune. "I think he was trying to get me to do it."Dillard told WWD.com that if Filner had his way he would have fired Shannon, too. Since she didn't, Dillard says he's	0
A judge this week sentenced a former TSA agent to six months in jail for secretly videotaping a female co-worker while she was in the bathroom, prosecutors said. ------------Free on bond, she's under indictment.Here's more from John Zarrella:He says he's got a hard time believing a fellow countryman could get a job as an airline pilot and then spend his off-time in such an apparently "dirty" business."It's a wonder I can even leave this house without somebody getting a DUI.""You don't expect to see someone who's in jail for two weeks going home in a suit, do you?" he tells The Associated Press."If I was ever on a plane I would never wear clothes like that.""People like us don't have a choice," he says. "We have to wear a uniform and we have to act like men and women of good faith. Nobody can walk around like that."----------A recent report on the safety of airline cockpit doors found that the majority of incidents occur when the door is left open.And according to aviation experts, it's not always the case."A good deal of passengers are looking out the window and seeing the whole cabin right now," says Bruce Vartabedian, a longtime aviation safety expert. "No cockpit door will ever be 100 percent reliable."It comes down to "the question of who is piloting the aircraft," he says. "Do they have a clear view of the cabin or not? And more important is the question of how do they operate the aircraft?"But even then, there's always a chance that someone will be hurt."What you need to know about any cockpit door is that it's not just a door," he says. "It is a deadly situation any time anyone enters a cockpit. There are no controls between the door and the aircraft."----------According to the Associated Press, former US Airways pilot Paul Pobiner is now suing the airline for a $65 million settlement. But his case is unlikely to go to trial on his behalf.Pobiner was allegedly assaulted by a fellow flight attendant on an American Airlines flight."I was just trying to help her get up," Pobiner says."My intention was never to harm her,"	0
For a long time it feels like we haven't seen much of Ronald McDonald. Not for nothing, but I heard he shanked Grimace in a back alley somewhere down in Mexico. That's the rumor, anyway. However, now the famous fast-food clown is back in the spotlight, and everything seems right in his world. McDonald's re-introduced Ronald on Wednesday, stating that he is "setting out on a global mission to rally the public through inspiring events." I'm sort of hoping this involves feats of strength, motorcycles, and explosions. And maybe some AC/DC. But probably not. Either way, good for him. It's hard to find honest work, especially when your LinkedIn skills include applying heavy makeup and crying yourself to sleep. Of course, Ronald McDonald, who's been the face of the company since 1963, is more than just a clown who goes on global missions. Because behind all that face paint lies a ruthless hamburger kingpin with a never-say-die attitude, capable of striking fear into his trembling sales team. "Put that McCafe Coffee down! McCafe coffee's for closers only." Yes, some may criticize Ronald for being too influential, as he entices kids to eat unhealthy fast food. I don't know the exact psychology behind it, but, presumably, it works like this: "Hey kids, look at the funny clown. Wee! How 'bout a Happy Meal?" And I'm OK with that. They're overseeing a restaurant business. It's not like McDonald's is a tattoo parlor. "Hey kids, look at the funny clown. Wee! How 'bout a koi fish on your neck?" So, he's a hamburger salesman. Big deal. A little diabetes never hurt anyone. But as major companies move forward with trends in society, sometimes even cultural icons need a dramatic makeover. So, a major part of the big rollout was some new, updated clothes. And when you're talking about the one and only Ronald McDonald, that requires strategy and careful planning. You can't just throw this guy in a car and drive him down to Old Navy. "Here's 50 bucks. Go nuts." I mean, the man is a legend. He deserves only the best. Which is why Ronald's new wardrobe was created by Ann Hould-Ward, an accomplished theatrical designer who won a Tony Award for "Beauty and the Beast."	1
On the London Underground there is a saying which has become synonymous with any tourist visit to the British capital. "Mind the Gap". It's up there with the Queen, a wonderfully indulgent cream tea, Beefeaters outside the Tower of London and the fact that the tube trains are not always painted with the colour of your choice.Despite these, a new initiative has been launched to encourage people to take pride in the tube by giving everyone a free one-day pass, in exchange for taking the stairs on their way up or down.It's called London Pass and it's being run by Transport for London, the body overseeing the capital's underground rail network, and, unusually, the company behind the Tube Map.Its mission is "to help people become more active in their community, make the most of their travel and connect people with destinations."It's a worthy goal. The more you use the Tube, the more likely you are to see it. Indeed, I've never met anyone who hasn't been to some tube station with their kids and they've always mentioned them being particularly impressed at how the trains look and how orderly they look, with people and belongings all neatly on display.It also helps when you spend time on the network. Most trains run at the same time but each line also operates at different times on different days. This means that if you're visiting, say, Notting Hill or Hammersmith and you want to take the tube to High Barnet or Hammersmith, you have to be there at the right station. This is why the network encourages people who want to go to a particular place to make the effort to use the London Pass.London Pass will cost £10 a day and you'll be able to get the ticket from the TfL website or from the company's travel bureau, at London's Victoria Coach Station. There will be up to six passes available at any one time, from a range of attractions. For instance, the Tube is open to everyone, but you might not see it everyday and, if you're visiting the Tower of London, for instance, you'll only need a pass to use the Underground between 9am and 9pm.But London Pass sounds like a great idea until you start trying it out. You can't sign up for the pass at the website but there's no way to apply for it until you book your tickets.	0
The final of the European Champions League will see two of the continent's giant clubs meet in the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, in a battle to decide the champions of the most lucrative competition in world soccer. The match, which takes place on 22 May, will also pitch two heavyweight coaches against one another in the shape of Portugal's Jose Mourinho and Holland's Louis Van Gaal. Mourinho, who won the European Cup with Porto in 2004, is hoping to cap a treble for the Nerazzurri after already wrapping up the Italian title and domestic cup prior to the game. Bayern are also looking to seal the capture of three pieces of silverware for the campaign, after beating Schalke to the Bundesliga title and also having won their domestic cup. Check out our profiles of the two coaches by clicking the links in the photo gallery above. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? The match will also see some of the greatest players in the world -- Arjen Robben, Samuel Eto'o, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lucio among them -- vie for the most lucrative title in club football before jetting off to South Africa to take part in the 2010 World Cup. CNN will have all the build up to the big match with Pedro Pinto and Alex Thomas hosting a special half-hour preview program on CNN International at 1800 GMT.

Move over, Emma. There's a new queen in town. Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday. Jacob, on the other hand, held on as the most popular boy's name for the 11th year in a row. The Social Security Administration started compiling name lists in 1997. And as in years past, the influence of pop culture is reflected in the names picked for newborns. The boy's name that rocketed up the list the fastest is Cullen -- the name of the lead character in the popular "Twilight" book series. Cullen's girlfriend in the books is Bella, short for Isabella. On the girls' side, the fastest riser is Maliyah, an altered version of the name of President Obama's daughter Malia -- which also is among the top 10 fast risers. But parents are equally quick to drop celebrity-inspired names once they think the popularity is passe. Among the biggest drops last year were Mylee and Miley, as in singer Miley Cyrus. Also on the outs: Lindsay and Jonas (think actress Lindsay Lohan and the band Jonas Brothers). Meanwhile, Barack continued to move up the list. Sixty-nine Baracks were born in 2009, the agency said. As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional. Among the popular names are Nevaeh (heaven spelled backward) for girls, and Messiah for boys. The 10 most popular girls' names, in order, are: Isabella, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Ava, Emily, Madison, Abigail, Chloe and Mia. The 10 most popular boys' name, also in order, are: Jacob, Ethan, Michael, Alexander, William, Joshua, Daniel, Jayden, Noah and Anthony.	1
It's not hip-hop without beef, right? We are still waiting to see if a war of words breaks out between rappers Nicki Minaj and Iggy Azalea after the former offered remarks at the 2014 BET Awards on Sunday that some took to be a diss toward the latter. Accepting the award for best female hip-hop artist, Minaj referenced writing her own lyrics. "What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj," she said,"when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it." BET Awards: Hits and a Lionel Richie miss There is talk that Azalea uses ghostwriters for some of her songs, so Twitter was immediately all over the comment. "So its safe to say there won't be any Nicki & Iggy collabs anytime soon," one viewer tweeted. Minaj added "No shade, no shade" about her comment, but that didn't stop the "Minaj throws shade" headlines around the Web. MTV notes that during Azalea's performance of her hit song "Fancy," Minaj grabbed an opportunity to vamp for the camera when it found her in the audience. "It's likely this moment will be used as further evidence that Nicki and Iggy have some kind of silent beef brewing," MTV's John Walker wrote. So far Azalea has been silent on the alleged shade.	1
President Bush on Sunday defended his decision to attend next month's Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing, saying that to boycott "would be an affront to the Chinese people." President Bush speaks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda at a Sunday news conference in Toyako, Japan. Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Japan, Bush said he did not need to skip the ceremony to show his position on religious freedom and human rights in China. He said if he failed to attend the Games it would "make it more difficult to be able to speak more frankly with the Chinese leadership." Bush said he would raise concerns when he meets Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Olympics, but he was also "looking forward to cheering the U.S. athletes." He said it was good for them "to see their president waving that flag." Japan's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in China that prompted some other European leaders to boycott the event. Bush and Fukuda took questions from reporters at the picturesque lakeside resort of Toyako on the northern island of Hokkaido, where the G-8 summit will begin Monday.  Watch Bush, first lady arrive in Japan » Bush said he and Fukuda discussed the United States' recent decision to lift some sanctions against North Korea and remove the communist nation from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terror. Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States. He told Fukuda that he was "fully aware of the sensitivity of the issue in your country" and that "the United States will not abandon you on this issue." North Korea has admitted to abducting 11 Japanese citizens -- to teach its spies Japanese language and culture -- but had insisted the abduction issue was resolved. Holding a book about a young Japanese girl abducted by North Korea, Bush said as the father of two girls he "can't imagine what it would be like to have a daughter disappear." Bush said North Korea's recent destruction of a water-cooling tower at its now-defunct nuclear facility and its declaration outlining its plutonium program are positive steps, but there are "more to be taken." Lifting sanctions would not weaken the pressure on North Korea to be forthcoming on the abduction issue or in nuclear negotiations, the U.S. president said.	1
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is under fire for a video showing party-bound fraternity members singing a racist chant. SAE's national chapter suspended the students, but University of Oklahoma President David Boren took it a step further,  firing them all and calling disciplinary hearings into their suspension.In another case, a high-ranking SAE officer was put on leave after allegedly sexually harassing female co-workers.History  Sigma Alpha Epsilon was founded by four Christian seminarians: Robert Allen Smith, James D. McAndrew, William O. Blythe and John S. Kennedy in 1932. In 1934, it officially incorporated with the State of Oklahoma.With the coming of World War II, it grew into a military organization, recruiting over 300 men to attend SAE's training camp at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. During the war and the Korean Korean War, SAE continued to expand nationwide. The organization expanded to 5,000 active members by 1952.In 1954, SAE's name was changed to the National Association of Fraternity Men. It later changed again to the National Collegiate Fraternity, Inc. and finally to the National College Greek Fraternity Association. In 1957, SAE's headquarters moved from Kansas City, Missouri to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. By the late 1960s, SAE had over 20,000 members and had offices in 12 states. It continued to expand through its membership as men from all branches and faiths were recruited to form a national organization.In 1964, SAE's state assembly changed its membership from students to men. However, in 1969, the national organization rebranded itself as the National College Greek Fraternity, which would still be in use as the SAE organization until 2013. Today, the organization is a coeducational, four-year college-preparatory fraternity founded by Christian men for Christian men. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is the National College Greek Fraternity Association's highest-ranking honorary society, with the current President, SAE President Gregory C. F. BlySIGMA ALPHA EPI'S HIGHLIGHTSAthletic programs Many SAE athletic teams participate in competitions in the NCAA and NCSU. Some of its teams include football, soccer, basketball, and baseball.See also  List of fraternal ordersNotesReferences	0
Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe. But an expert on the Mexican drug war, Malcolm Beith, disputed that assertion. "They're already operating in Europe," he told CNN in a telephone interview, citing reports of the cartel shipping drugs to ports in England, Netherlands and Germany. Spain is the principal gateway for drugs coming to Europe, Beith said. The operation, dubbed "Dark Waters" and carried out in collaboration with the FBI, resulted in the arrests in Madrid of four members of the cartel, which is run by Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as "El Chapo," police said in a statement. Dark Waters was initiated in May 2009 by the FBI's office in Boston, Massachusetts, which was looking into the cartel, said the statement. In October 2010, agents from the FBI met with the National Police's Central Brigade of Organized Crime after learning of the cartel's alleged plans to expand operations in Europe, it said. The bulk of the investigation unfolded in the United States, where U.S. agents discovered that cartel members were planning to travel to Spain, a trip that occurred the following March, the statement said. Once the suspects were inside Spain, they were placed under tight surveillance by Spanish police, it said. "Thanks to the exchange of information with the FBI, one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship, hidden in containers with legal, declared cargo," it said. "They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug. Finally, they sent their first shipment in a boat from Brazil. The container, which was intercepted in late July in the Port of Algeciras, concealed 373 kilos of cocaine." Investigators identified Jesus Gonzalo Palazuelos Soto, who moved to Madrid to oversee the operation, as a member of the group, it said. A few days later, he was joined by Jesus Gutierrez Guzman, a cousin of "El Chapo" and considered the leader of the group; Samuel Zazueta Valenzuela, a principal collaborator, and Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, who was overseeing the organization's "legal" affairs, it said.	1
The recent flotilla incident is the culmination of a steep decline in Israeli-Turkish relations that started with the Gaza war in 2008 and 2009. Relations between these two countries, after reaching a high point in the late 1990s and early 2000s,  have fallen sharply. The deterioration in inter-Jewish relations is now so severe that in November 2012, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan against meeting with Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip. Turkish officials are under diplomatic and physical pressure to expel Israeli envoys at gun-point. (See Foreign Relations of Turkey, 2008–2009 and Foreign Relations of Turkey, 2011–2012; and The Ties That Bind by Steven R. Weisman, The New York Times, 2004.)The Gaza flotilla incident came about because of Turkey’s longstanding objection to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands. While no Israeli official ever explicitly threatened to attack Turkish ships with weapons, Prime Minister Erdoğan has been the target of an intense diplomatic campaign since at least 2002 when he openly accused Israel of being responsible for the 2002 Turkish coup attempt.To take the most extreme example, Erdoğan has reportedly said that he would like to have Israeli ships blown up. During the Gaza flotilla incident, the Turkish press and the Turkish government were at the forefront of public discussion with regard to the incident, and it is still open debate whether Erdoğan’s words were serious or not.The flotilla incident has also created a rift in relations between Israel and Iran. There is a widespread perception that Israel, in the wake of the incident, is seeking closer collaboration with Iran, and this perception is reinforced by statements made by Prime Minister Erdoğan. Iran has taken sides in the affair. According to Israeli Ambassador in Tehran, the following statement was made by Javad Zarif:“[Iran’s] Minister of Foreign Affairs called on the Turkish ambassador to convey the wish that Israel and Iran would work together on finding a satisfactory solution for the problem.”Iran has also said that Israel is responsible for the loss of life on the Turkish vessel and has called Turkey to end its campaign against Israel. Israel, as a matter of principle, does not agree with any such statements and takes them seriously.At the same time, Israeli officials are calling on the Turkish authorities to expel the IDF and its officials from their border crossing.

Less than a day after Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency and scolded the country's media for being too "negative," police stormed the offices of a television station early Sunday, AAJ-TV's director of news and current affairs said. Pakistani policemen patrol the streets of Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday. Armed with guns, the two dozen police said they had orders to take the station's equipment, including a van that the station uses to broadcast live coverage, Talat Hussain said. "We resisted," Hussain said. "We said show us the papers." The police didn't have proof their demands were legitimate, he said, adding the officers said only that they had orders "from the highest authority." "They said, 'We'll do it the nice way or the other way,' " Hussain said. A brief scuffle between the policemen and about 40 journalists in the station followed, but no one was hurt, he said. During the confrontation, two AAJ journalists were able to drive the news van away from the station, Hussain said. Police later left the building, but remained outside, Hussain said. The raid followed a government directive to the media, warning journalists that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000, Hussain said. Earlier, in a Saturday night televised address to the Pakistani public aimed at explaining why he had declared a countrywide state of emergency and suspended the constitution, Musharraf was critical of the country's media, saying they had "added insult to injury." "The media could not lend a helping hand to improve the situation," Musharraf said, describing "the situation" in Pakistan as fraught with tension and constrained by the spread of terrorism. "I said frequently that the media should not be negative," Musharraf said. Shortly after private networks reported Saturday that Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency was imminent, most media channels went off the air in an apparent blackout, although some flickered off and on.

Kelsey Grammer -- actor, producer, Twitter grammarian. Grammer's verified Twitter account started on June 30 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the day Apple's stock dropped Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when President Barack Obama was in the Philippines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and has since gained more than 4,000 followers. Grammer's tweets are funny, informative and usually include the phrase "No, I'm not talking to you" along with snarky remarks about how the president's supporters are "the most obnoxious and least intellectual group of people I have ever met." At the time of publication of this article Grammer had nearly 15,000 followers and was followed by more than 2,500 people. He's also been featured on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Grammer, who has a degree in music composition from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, recently posted a photo on Twitter of him jamming two guitars on stage with his daughter. He's been a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in August he will be inducted into that same hall.The only thing I'd have done differently is not tweet that I'm not talking to you. It was like a "please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get mad" moment. But then all of a sudden, I had to start talking to people. So I think the answer to your question is: yes, I do think I should have tweeted that. I've since learned from this and have made it a point of etiquette that I shouldn't have, but what I should have done is made a joke or comment along the lines of: hey, sorry, I forgot to tell you I'm not talking to you. I don't think it was the best. You should have either deleted, reposted, or followed through on the original tweet. Then, if it had gotten you in trouble, you could have used it as a excuse to say you shouldn't have posted it in the first place. It could have even been used as an Ã¢â‚¬Å"on the recordÃ¢â‚¬Â apology to make yourself look like a better person. But, as far as your actual question, the answer is "yes" I should have posted that.

When Barack Obama was a newbie president, there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead. Government should be seen as a force for good, not evil. Sure, he told us, it  would be a good idea to have a president who cared deeply about the problems we face. But there would never be a time when the country needed to pay closer attention to global developments than it does now, when the stakes are so high, and the stakes so high because of the size of the problem.It is easy to see why Obama believed that. It is, among other things, because of the way that he thinks about the world -- and his mind is so broad, and so deep, and so broad again, that it extends to the vast reaches of history, to the history of civilizations, to the history of politics and even to the history of his own life. It is the Obama of the University of Chicago speech:So you say you feel a responsibility to act in the world. That can be very hard. And there's no surefire way to do it. But as difficult as it is, it is our obligation to do the best we can, every day, to make sure that everyone in our country feels that responsibility.And it is because of this sense of responsibility that Obama has a strong moral sense of what he needs to do to protect the country and what he needs to take on politically to make it safe for his presidency. And this has all been about a sense of responsibility in his case, and you know, that's not unique to him, that's something that he has carried throughout his life, and it is what guides him, and this is what guides me.Obama is convinced that people's sense of responsibility has been compromised by his rise to power, by the way he has made himself the object of a campaign of character assassination that has left him the target of vicious attacks -- from fellow Democrats; from the media; from people who have no stake in his success; from the people who actually matter most to him.At the time in 2008 that Obama had the idea of making it a cornerstone of his presidency that he would, as a president, take the moral high ground and show that he had the power and the mandate to act on behalf of the country and do what he thought was right. In the years after Obama took office, he made himself the	0
Delays in deposing Kanye West and other witnesses in the divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries mean the 72-day marriage may not legally end until next year, lawyers said at a hearing Wednesday. Humphries, an NBA forward, iced the marriage on Aug. 15 and filed for divorce Oct. 11.West responded on his Web site Wednesday, posting a picture of himself with his 7-year-old daughter, North, and writing: "She is the greatest gift of my life. My life began as a man but it has become as a father and as a son."Attorney Michael R. Fox, who represents West, called the marriage "a sham," saying that the couple have a "mutually destructive relationship.""The court has made its order. It will be enforced," he said after Wednesday's hearing. "It was a mutual decision. Kim wants to leave (the marriage) as quickly as possible.''West gave a deposition in the divorce case on Nov. 1 but delayed it two times Thursday to give his attorneys more time to prepare for the trial, Riseman, the attorney, said.West's deposition is scheduled for Friday, and a final report is due Nov. 1. West's attorney Riseman said the deposition will be videotaped by the court reporter.West's daughter, a 2-year-old, flew to her parents' Los Angeles home Monday so the child's father and sister, Riseman said."She was really upset, and I knew she was hurting,'' Riseman said of the child's reaction to the delay in deposing West.Riseman said he hopes it will be a quick divorce but is concerned about the effects the delay may have on West with his pre-teen daughter, because an ex-wife has suggested she will use the delay in trying to regain custody of her child."That's really a question for the court. It's a matter of concern, but I don't know how many people that would be, and how many people in his life are aware of the situation,'' Riseman said.West and Kardashian had marriage talks in July and again in August but decided that the time wasn't right for marriage, Riseman said.Humphries and his family have been involved in the case since the start, and he did not appear at the court hearing	0
People in cars and on bikes whizzed by Moustafa Mohamad as he sat on a sidewalk in Washington one day not so long ago. Commuters poured out of the Dupont Circle Metro station and rushed by on their way to school or Â lunch with their kids. He didn't seem to mind. He was riding a bike. The 20-year-old student had just graduated from high school and was on his way to work as an aide for a developmentally disabled man named Abdul Kadir."I'm a computer programmer," Mohamad, who asked his middle name not be used to avoid drawing attention to his disability, told BuzzFeed News. "I don't think I'm very good on a bike. But it's my friend's car, so I was happy to be helping him."Mohamad and Kadir are two examples of the thousands of kids who use cars for transportation every day in Washington, DC, according to the Alliance for Biking and Walking, a local non-profit that helped them find rides during the past few weeks that resulted in a new advocacy organization, Biking in Washington.The ride-hailing company Uber and ride-sharing service Lyft have been trying to change the city's culture around driving and, in turn, bringing more non-drivers on the roads. But the success of such programs requires a lot more than just building partnerships and getting riders to use their cars to get to work, said Michael Schutz, who is the executive director of the Alliance for Biking."[It's] about getting drivers to use their cars as an option to ride," Schutz said.The ride-hailing programs are starting to be more popular. Last year, Uber launched a program in Washington, D.C., while Lyft kicked off a similar program in Seattle.But Uber and Lyft are not the only companies trying to change the culture around driving. Uber has been working to get its drivers to become ambassadors for the company, but the company has had a rough time getting drivers to accept that role and to spread the company message, said Schutz."It's a different culture when you're not driving your own cars," he said. "Drivers are used to doing what they do on their own time and on their own time with others' cars."In recent months, Uber has worked to convince local drivers to accept the ambassador role	0
Despite a highly-publicized anti-corruption drive spearheaded by President Xi Jinping, China's position on an international corruption perceptions index has deteriorated in the past 12 months. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions  Index has been on a downward trend over the past three years, and has slipped from a score of 919 in 2018 to 818 in 2019.In 2018, there were 11,094 cases of public corruption, a decline of 1% from the previous year. However, this year's decline was less pronounced, as China's public corruption cases have dropped to 11,006 this year, down 1.5% from the previous year. Meanwhile, a total of 7,053 cases were identified as being "proportionate to the size of the problem" for the first time, down 3.1% from 2018.In 2018, a record 5,941 public servants were investigated for corruption, accounting for 2% of all government employees. This number was down from the previous record high of 6,087 in 2017. At the same time, the number of people convicted for corruption fell to 1,094, from 1,229 in 2017."The ongoing reform of anti-corruption laws and the introduction of measures to promote integrity and transparency in public entities have significantly contributed to addressing and preventing public corruption," said Yang Yujun, the general director of Transparency International. "China's anti-corruption efforts are still far behind those of neighboring countries.""The Chinese public has a good understanding of the rule of law," said Yang, who is also a member of the central committee of the China Public Opinion Survey Foundation. "However, corruption and bribery has to play a central role in building trust in China's public institutions."While President Trump's administration has pledged to root out corruption in public and private sector throughout the United States, critics worry that China may soon be catching up."As long as China is able to develop a comprehensive anti-corruption legislation and policies, we will take the lead in fighting corruption," said Chen Xilian, a professor at Peking University's School of Journalism. "However, if it continues to be based on a series of selective laws, such as the notorious criminal laws, it is difficult for China to build a comprehensive system."There are other reasons for the decline in public and private sector corruption. For example, the number of corruption cases investigated by Chinese anti-corruption	0
An Iraqi soldier fatally shot two American soldiers and wounded three others on Saturday, the U.S. military said. A man lies in a hospital after a roadside bombing near Kirkurk on Saturday. Three Iraqis were killed. The shooter Â has been identified as Muntadhar al-Zaidi, a sergeant in the Iraqi army's special forces, the U.S. military said. Reuters/Baz RatnerIn a dramatic reversal from Washington's position on Monday, the U.S. military has announced that Iraqi soldiers killed 13 U.S. soldiers in two bombings in Iraq. The announcement came as the Obama administration had sought to downplay the incident:The U.S. military has confirmed that U.S. soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in Iraq on Saturday. The first attack took place at the Khazirain training base in Basra, Iraq. In the second attack, three U.S. soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in Kirkuk province. Four soldiers were also injured in the first attack, according to military officials."The soldier responsible for this attack left his post on the base," said military spokesman Colonel Dave East. "There is no evidence he returned to it." The Basra attack occurred when the soldiers were on an exercise routine and preparing to move.The American deaths were not caused by enemy action, according to military official who requested anonymity to discuss the incident. The spokesman said the attack appeared to be the first since the U.S. military put out a request for an increase of Iraqi forces to bolster security for the embassy. A small number of Iraqis had been in the area the day before the attack, according to the official, who said he had not been told how many Iraqis were in the unit at the time of the attack.The Iraqi deaths mark the first time killed American soldiers were caused by a private in the regular Iraqi army. As the Washington Post reports,The U.S. military's announcement raises the specter of a potential internal problem among the soldiers and how to treat the incident. The U.S. soldiers were killed in a manner that would have been considered appropriate for an Iraqi soldier.The Iraqi's had a military training course; therefore, the U.S. military has no way of knowing whether they were in the country for some other purpose and just wandered onto the base, where they were shot.	0

Work on the world's largest solar bridge has started in central London. The new solar roof spanning Blackfriars Railway Bridge above the River Thames will  span more than 700 panels, with a capacity to generate up to 50,000 kilowatts per hour of energy, enough to power 80,000 homes.This is a significant milestone on the way to the installation of more than 100,000 panels in 20 solar parks scattered across the UK, a plan that the government hopes will be completed in 2017.It is hoped that the bridge, which connects the River Thames to the Houses of Parliament, will generate enough energy to meet the needs of London's transport needs for the next three years. The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) says it will be used to power "several kilometres" of new rail tracks.The panels will be used to provide extra electricity in the grid, but are not intended to be directly used as a source of energy. According to the Solar Trade Association, a body representing solar installers, the solar panels will provide a "significant boost" to renewable power.According to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, a number of solar parks are already being planned, across the country, but the largest are planned in Scotland, northern England and Wales. It is hoped that many more parks will be provided in a bid to give the UK the largest solar power capacity in Europe, which it is now estimated at around 8GW.The government will be issuing guidelines next year for the placement of the 30 best solar parks and, when they are in place, the government hopes that renewable power will be sufficient to power the electricity needs of an additional 40 million households.But the installation of solar generation is not without its critics. There are plans to roll out the technology on a much grander scale and, while the government believes that these solar parks will be capable of supplying all of the country's electricity needs, there are concerns that they will be largely unregulated and in areas where many residents are unwilling to install their own solar installations. It is not yet clear whether the government has agreed to provide solar parks for all of the country or whether it only plans to provide such parks in areas where there is a strong demand for renewable energy.We are told that the government is considering setting up a solar generation grid that would produce electricity from solar and other renewable sources at times of low demand.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday led Justice Department tributes to former presidential adviser and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, who died at 90. Holder had a personal connection to Katzenbach, remembered for facing down Alabama Gov. George Wallace at a schoolhouse door in June 1963 to desegregate the University of Alabama. Cameras recorded the confrontation between Katzenbach, then serving as deputy attorney general, and Wallace. The governor declared the desegregation "illegal and unwarranted" and stood in the doorway. Katzenbach replied, "Governor, I am not interested in a show." The Alabama National Guard enforced the registration of two African-American students and Wallace grudgingly stepped aside. One of the students was Vivian Malone, a sister of Sharon Malone, who later married Holder. Katzenbach died of natural causes Tuesday at his home in Skillman, New Jersey, according to Princeton University, where Katzenbach earned a degree and served as trustee emeritus. He was a top adviser to President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy on several key issues, including the Cuban missile crisis. Katzenbach was attorney general for two years during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Katzenbach drafted and â€” serving as Johnson's liaison to Congress â€” secured passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, according to Princeton. Holder called Katzenbach "one of our nation's great champions of civil rights and equal justice." Katzenbach, a New Jersey native, attended top prep schools and Ivy League colleges. He went to Germany to fight in World War II. His plane was shot down and he was captured by the Nazis and taken prisoner. According to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Katzenbach in October 1962 drafted a legal brief in support of Kennedy's decision to blockade Cuba. Holder said Katzenbach will continue to be "an inspiration for me, for my colleagues across the Department of Justice, and for the nation he was so proud to serve." Katzenbach was deputy attorney general from 1962 to 1964, and attorney general in 1965 and 1966. He also served as undersecretary of state from 1966 to 1969. He is survived by his wife, Lydia; sons, John and Christopher; his daughters, Maria and Anne; and six grandchildren. A memorial service was being planned.	1
Ending a decade-long campaign led by African-American lawmakers, the House Wednesday approved and sent to President Barack Obama a measure to reduce the disparity in penalties between use of crack and powder cocaine. Under a 25-year-old law, mandatory minimum sentences involving crack cocaine -- a drug more commonly used by blacks than whites -- led to far more severe penalties than for offenses involving powder cocaine, generally preferred by whites. "The Fair Sentencing Act will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1," said Congressman John Conyers, D-Michigan, who applauded the passage. Conyers said the crack mandatory sentences had pushed the number of drug offenders in federal prisons from fewer than 5,000 in 1980 to nearly 100,000 in 2009. The law drops the five-year mandatory sentence for first time offenders, and for repeat offenders with less than 28 grams of crack. Current law sets the mandatory sentence for conviction at five grams. Support for reducing the disparity with powder cocaine offenders increased with reports beginning in 2002 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission calling for Congress to change the crack cocaine law. The commission is independent agency in the  judicial branch that develops national sentencing policy  for the federal courts. The House measure, passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support, follows passage by the Senate in March. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder had both pressed for passage of the law. "This day was long in coming," said Holder. He said the bill will "go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair." Members of the Congressional Black Caucus had led the battle for passage for 10 years. Holder also singled out key Republicans including Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who had joined with Democrats. Conyers tipped his hat to House GOP members Dan Lungren, R-California, James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, and Ron Paul, R-Texas, for their support. Not all Republicans joined the majority, however. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake.	1
The international community is now waiting for confirmation from the United States and South Korea on whether a seismic disturbance in North Korea Tuesday is in fact the hermit regime's third underground nuclear test. The area of the disturbance is near the area of North Korea's two previous nuclear tests. The epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 event has little to no history of earthquakes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If confirmed as a North Korean nuclear explosion, the event would closely follow a controversial rocket launch from December which marked a milestone in the pariah state's rocket program. The United States and many other countries believe it is a cover for the testing of ballistic missile technology. Late 1970s With Chinese technical assistance, North Korea begins working on the development of short-range ballistic missiles based on Soviet Scud technology, which is itself derived from Germany's V-2 rocket. 1980-84 Work starts on the development of the North's own version of the Scud-B missile system, thought to be designated the Hwasong-5. Successfully test launches several prototypes with a range of around 300km. 1985-87 Deployment of Hwasong-5 begins, followed by the longer range Hwasong-6 (500km), which gives Pyongyang the ability to hit targets deep into South Korea. 1987-95 Begins development of No-dong missiles, a "scaled up" version of the Scud with a range of 1,000-1,300km and much larger payload, allowing it to reach Japan and Taiwan. A No-dong is successfully tested from the Musudan-ri launch site, traveling 500km before plunging into the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Though the project is beset by technical problems -- the missile's targeting system was inaccurate -- the No-dong arouses particular concern because it could potentially carry a nuclear warhead. North Korea has long been suspected of developing its own nuclear weapons program. Late 1990s Pyongyang introduces the Taepo-dong-1 and 2 -- both multi-stage missiles that give them a much longer range. A Taepo-dong-1 is test-fired in August 1998 -- reportedly overflying northern Japan -- in an apparent attempt to deploy a satellite in space. Though the mission fails, the first two stages of the three-stage rocket separate successfully and travel for almost 1,700km. May 1999	1
Former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker passed away recently. Although he was known for many things, Baker's most enduring moment came in the middle of the Watergate scandal, when he asked: "What did the president know and when did he know it?" The scandal happened 40 years ago. It started with a break-in at the Democratic headquarters in Washington, D.C. and it was followed with subsequent efforts to obstruct an investigation into whether the White House had been involved. In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that the White House had to turn over recorded presidential conversations to the investigators. The House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the three articles of impeachment, charging President Richard Nixon with obstruction of justice. The Watergate scandal had a devastating effect on American politics. In his riveting forthcoming book, "The Invisible Bridge," Rick Perlstein skillfully recounts the era that was shaped by the scandal and the way in which the sordid activities of the Nixon administration unfolded on a day-by-day basis. Each revelation gave voters another reason not to trust their elected officials and to believe the worst arguments that people made about government. Americans could never look at government the same way again. The scandal continues to reverberate today throughout the political spectrum. We still live in the era of Watergate. For Democrats, who many thought would have been the beneficiaries of a scandal that brought down a Republican president, the level of distrust that the scandal generated among the public has been an ongoing challenge. At the most basic level, Democrats argue that the federal government offers the best solution to the problems of the day. But if the public does not trust its elected officials, Democrats are left in a position of having to constantly defend the legitimacy of the institutions of government and to convince voters that bureaucrats really will do their job. The intense skepticism surrounding the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi and the Internal Revenue Service scandal have revealed how easy it is for opponents of government to stoke these kinds of fears. Republicans have suffered too, even after the party separated itself from Nixon as its figurehead. The truth is that Republicans promote government as well, just for different reasons. Their programs have, likewise, been subject to constant scrutiny as a result of the lingering distrust from Watergate. For conservatives, national security programs have been a centerpiece of their agenda. Republicans have pushed for expanding the military budget and since 9/11 many have called for an aggressive response to terrorism that includes sweeping surveillance programs and enhanced interrogation techniques.	1
For the residents of Christchurch, New Zealand, time stopped at 12.51pm on February 22, 2011, when a massive earthquake ripped through the city, destroying homes, lives and businesses. One year on, reminders are never  away but there are many lessons to learn from what has happened in the last twelve months.#1 One year onOne year on, Christchurch remains the worst tragedy to ever devastate our New Zealand and Australia's capital city. The effects of the earthquake will remain with us for many years. Those who lost their lives are still being mourned.Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed. The death toll has grown to more than 5000, many more than the official figure. More than 1,000 people are still missing. In the next few weeks the search will continue for the many missing people.I have been asked how it feels to live with knowing you lost your loved ones in the earthquake. My answer is that at the moment I don't feel anything, nor do I ever want to.I feel numb. When I go back into the city I feel like a stranger. On the street I will see people with their eyes swollen shut in pain. I will walk past people who have lost their limbs, their eyes, one eye, a limb, or all their limbs. This is how I know that the survivors and the injured will never forget the pain. The survivors will never forget what they lost.At the moment, I don't feel sorry for anyone. I've made it clear in my blogs that I don't feel sorry for anyone. I know that this is about as far as I will go with empathy at this time. I still feel a deep sense of loss.So much for empathy, right?So much for empathy, right?In Christchurch, there are many people who haven't lost a loved one. They are still living their lives, and some are just trying to carry on. However, the shock and the chaos following the earthquake is leaving families feeling even more helpless and alone.My question is, "What should have they done? What should they have done in the face of such a horrific tragedy. Why did they let their loved ones die. Why did they let their loved ones die so soon after the disaster happened?"This question has been on my mind for weeks, and I have yet to find an	0
The year 2012 was a historic one for Saudi Arabia. It was the first time two women from the country competed at an Olympic Games. A month earlier, ten Saudi women climbed to Mount Everest base camp, headed by Princess Reema Bandar to raise awareness of breast cancer and to promote physical activity. However the situation for sports women from the country was different at the recently completed Asian Games in South Korea. Western media and various international organizations including Human Rights Watch commented that not one of the 199 athletes from Saudi Arabia was a woman. Mohammed Al-Mishal, the Secretary General of Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee said that Saudi Arabia was committed to sending female athletes to the next Olympics, but "they were not yet competitive enough for the Asian Games." "Technically, we weren't ready to introduce any ladies and the new president of our Olympic committee (Prince Abdullah bin Musaed bin Abdulaziz) rejected sending women to only participate, as he wanted them to compete," said Al-Mishal. Jeddah United is a women's basketball team started in 2003. In 2006 it evolved into a sports company that trains both girls and boys in team sports with the aim of promoting sports in the Kingdom and developing potential Olympic talents. Since the company was established, an elite team for both girls and boys has been training hard for possible international competition and to lay the foundation for a potential girls national team. Over the years there have been many statements by high-ranking officials in the local media in Saudi Arabia that supported integrating girl sports in public schools, opening private clubs, allowing female participation in neighborhood centers, and setting the stage for more Olympic participation. However, logistical challenges remain, as there are no local sports professionals and no space is being made available in these public schools. In addition to that, very limited private facilities are available for similar activities, and there are no female members of Saudi Arabia's various sporting federations with the exception of Arwa Mutabagani in the Equestrian Federation. Finally, the absence of physical education departments in colleges and universities is another major hindrance to seeing more girls and women in sports. However, and in accordance with Prince Abdullah bin Musaid's vision, Jeddah United believes that, in international competitions, female athletes should be at a level to compete and not just participate symbolically.	1
An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on hillsides vulnerable to mudslides, authorities said. With the sun shining over much of Los Angeles, officials told people who live in the foothill areas of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return to their homes at 8 a.m. PT (11 a.m. ET). Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for those residents Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted. The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was especially hit hard after a downpour Saturday unleashed a river of mud that damaged dozens of homes. Several of the homes were declared uninhabitable. A massive wildfire in the Angeles National Forest last summer burned hillsides where these homes are located.	1
Police in Jackson, Mississippi, have prepared an arrest warrant for former television host Gary Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, police spokesman Colendula Green told CNN. Officers were called to the scene Monday afternoon but when police arrived, only one of the parties involved was there. The victim "had been stopped at a red light and was rear-ended by a white Jeep, driven by Gary Collins," Green said. Collins' lawyer, Tom Royals, said his client had gotten out of his vehicle, examined the accident, and exchanged information with the driver of the other car. After calling the police, Collins left because he had been waiting for some time and he thought he had done all that was required, Royals said. "The other party knew his information," Royals said. "And in fact Collins knew someone in the car. They talked a while and then he left." Green agreed that the ex-actor had provided his contact information but said Jackson Police have cited Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. Police are waiting to execute the arrest warrant once a judge signs off on it. The other driver is pressing charges, Green said. "It was not a serious accident," Royals said. "It was really just a minor fender-bender." Collins is known for being a TV and radio personality, and is married to former Miss America Mary Anne Mobley. As an actor, he is known his role in the television series "The Sixth Sense," and "The Wackiest Ship in the Army."	1
College basketball has a new record holder for most points in a game. Last week, Jack Taylor, a 5-foot, 10-inch guard at Iowa's Grinnell College, scored 138 points to lead Grinnell to a 179-104 blowout win over Faith  The game took place at the Hawkeye Arena in Grinnell, Iowa. Taylor scored 24 points in the first half as Grinnell put 40 points on the board at the half, and another 24 in the second half. Taylor's 138 points represent a new high for points in a game at Iowa with 10 others since the game in 1978.

Iowa (5-4) had lost to  Faith 20 times since 1990.Taylor, a junior who has recorded three triple-doubles this season, reached the 100-point mark for the third time this  season. He came into the game averaging a career high 37 points per game.Taylor had nine points in the first half, and scored 25 in the second half as the Wildcats outrebounded Iowa 53  to 26. Grinnell outscored Iowa 32 to  3. Iowa had won four of its last five and is ranked No. 15 in the nation."It was kind of like a football game when we had so many penalties, but it was a fun game," Taylor said.Taylor's 138 points were the most by any player in Iowa's history in a game.While Iowa had three games left to play this season, Taylor was trying to be one with the team. The  6-1 guard was trying to become one with the school's basketball team after a  separate semester leading a student-run band in which he sang "Kumbaya.""I think of it as a job that I am doing for two people: Iowa and my band," Taylor said.

If you want to salute, race or flirt with other drivers in Nevada, you could soon be out of luck with some cars. That's because on Monday, Nevada became the first to approve a license for "autonomous vehicles" -- in other vernacular, cars that drive themselves.The law, passed unanimously in the Senate, eliminates a roadblock created after crashes between Tesla and General Motors vehicles, including a Model S that careened into the back of a pickup truck last year and a Model X that crashed into a car near Laughlin last November.It also brings Nevada in line with the rest of the country. In a July poll conducted by University of Michigan researchers, 77 percent of American drivers agreed with the statement "Tesla is the future of autonomous cars." Only 25 percent disagreed. On the road to a national ban on autonomous cars, we're one of a kind.While some fear a slippery slope that could result in fully driverless cars, or cars that may drive themselves, there's a more practical concern. Cars built by companies like Tesla or General Motors, with their advanced features, offer a variety of advantages over those of other carmakers.An autonomous car could be safer and a lot cheaper to operate. It could cut traffic on the road by up to 20 percent while reducing the need for gas stations, according to studies conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.And it could cut pollution, reduce accidents and save more than $2 billion through efficiency savings. But while Tesla and GM are racing to make those cars, other carmakers are trying to beat them to the market in the same way that so many others have before them -- with innovation and research."It's a race to the finish," says Jeff Kagan, the top safety engineer for GM in the United States. He works in the technical center here at GM's research site in Warren. "They are racing against some of these people who were working on autonomous cars 10, 20, 30 years ago."Kagan says GM will spend billions of dollars over the next decade on autonomous technology, including a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt electric car that he calls the "smartest" on earth."This is the stuff that companies spend a lot of money on to do," he says. "And they are going to do it."There's another, more important question: What will be the final result when the	0
The U.S. Air Force Academy is mourning its first female graduate to be killed by enemy forces in Afghanistan or Iraq. First Lt. Roslyn L. Schulte, who graduated from North Carolina's Air Force ROTC program in May 2013, was killed by an explosive-laden rocket fired by insurgents in Afghanistan's Kandahar Province,according to arelease sent by the academy.Schulte was just 15 years old in May 2013 when, following a summer program at the academy, she was among15-20 cadets selected to attend ROTC boot camp. According to U.S. Air Forces Central Command spokesperson Col. Patrick Ryder, ROTC cadets are required to serve as combatant-unitmembers and provide noncombatant support, including the use of weapons,as part of the U.S. military’s commitment to the security of Afghanistan andIraq.The academy says Schulte, a North Carolina native, was honored and respected by all she encountered at AirForce ROTC. “On behalf of the academy and her family, we extend our deepestappreciation for all she gave and for the honor and privilege of her friendship,” says a statement released by the academy.Schulte, a junior airman, graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration. She was also a United States Air Force Academymember, Air Force ROTC cadet, and senior airman at Cannon Air Force Base, North Carolina.Schulte was a member of the Air Force Academy ROTC Class of 2013.Pompey A. Pappas, superintendent of the academy's Air Force ROTC program, says Schulte's death was a profound loss for the entire AirForce Academy community.“We lost one of our own in combat,” Pappas said, referring to Schulte being one of the first women killed in combat by enemy forces in Afghanistanor Iraq. “We lost her because of her leadership and character as a young cadet, and because she followed the call of her nation."Schulte died as she lay wounded in an enemy-occupied district in eastern Afghanistan. Her death comes as both President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary RobertGates are seeking to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, part of	0
In middle school, a lot of kids think it's cool to cuss and toss around four-letter words like a soccer ball at recess. McKay Hatch, 16, launched an initiative to curb the use of profanity. But when McKay Hatch was in eighth grade, he called foul on the cussing he heard. Hatch started the No Cussing Club. It began at his school and then, through his Web site, attracted members of all ages from all 50 states and 30 countries. His efforts even got the attention of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which declared the first week of March "No Cussing Week." CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to the 16-year-old about the recent success of his movement and the trials he overcame to start it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. McKay Hatch: Actually, when I first went to my parents about the idea, my dad was kind of like, 'No, no, don't do this.' He knew I'd get bullied and teased, which I did, and more. I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win.  Watch the entire interview with McKay Hatch » Nicole Lapin: Well, you received not only death threats we should say, McKay. Your site was hacked into, prostitutes were sent to your house. Were you ever scared by any of those threats? Hatch: At first I was actually pretty scared because they said, 'I know where you live.' Our address was posted online on a really big Web site and at first I was scared. But like I said, these are bullies and they wanted me to be scared and I wasn't going to let them win. Lapin: Even with the bullies, even with the threats, is this now in 30 different countries with thousands of members? Is it worth it? Hatch: It's definitely worth it. Now we have members in all 50 states and 30 countries. People are signing up with our Web site nocussing.com and they're taking the pledge to use language to uplift and make people feel good about themselves. That's what this whole club is. Lapin: It's not really about just cussing. It's also about civility.	1
Two sentences inscribed above the refurbished entrance hall of Moscow's Kurskaya metro station are causing great agitation for survivors of Russian labor camps.Yuri Fidelgoldsh, who had five ribs removed after  a decade of torture in one of these camps, recently won a state pension for his work.Yuri FI've just returned from Moscow and I'm not at all happy with my first impressions of Russia. In fact, I've found them to be among the worst in the world.The Russians seem to do absolutely everything within their power to make life unpleasant for their own citizens; they even do that to foreigners. They have the same attitude with a foreign nation as the English do with the natives of their own island.I have found that in Russia everyone speaks with a heavy accent, especially at first. This is especially the case among foreigners. It seems that foreigners in Russia are just as eager to tell their Russian friends and acquaintances that they are from another country rather than actually telling them what language they speak.I am now taking a train to St. Petersburg, and I am not looking forward to the journey.I have travelled on Russian trains many times in the past, and so I know something about Russian trains, but not many people do.I know that during the war they were the only means of transport available to the country. The Russians have a large army, and it was necessary for the country to have a means of mass transport, so all the people were compelled to take one. The first thing I noticed when arriving at St. Petersburg was the enormous number of foreign soldiers in the streets. I knew that this would be the case, as it is very difficult to get a train to Moscow on short notice. However, it soon became apparent that the soldiers were not in the regular army, but in some kind of reserve.I knew that they were Russian citizens who had taken leave of active service in Russia, but I had no idea that they had been used in this manner. I don't know what the Russians would have done to them without the military support of the Americans...This being the nineteenth century, Russia was a country caught between two hostile powers, Germany and Austria, who were at each other's throats.Russia had a large navy, and some of the German ships had been fitted with mines. This is not something I have ever heard of before, and I am not surprised.I know that there is a shortage of food	0
As speaker of the House, John Boehner faced battles on two fronts during his first term: fights with President Barack Obama on a series of high-profile fiscal issues, and internal skirmishes with conservative rank-and-file Republicans who openly defied him because they didn't think he was doing enough to cut spending. And as Obama takes the oath of office and begins to address the challenges of his second term, his on-again, off-again negotiating counterpart faces his own set of challenges in the coming weeks. Days after the bruising fight at the end of 2012 to avert the fiscal cliff that divided the House GOP conference -- as well as his own leadership team -- a dozen House Republicans broke with Boehner by not supporting him for speaker in the public vote on the House floor. Boehner was reelected with the vast majority of his conference sticking with him, but the episode demonstrated his weakened position and raised questions about whether he could lead his members in new fights ahead. House Republicans pledge to back Boehner But after a three-day retreat of all House Republicans last week at a resort in Williamsburg, Virginia, GOP members appear to be regrouping and putting the messy squabbles behind them. Leaders are shifting their strategy away from one of aggressive confrontation to giving some ground to show they can govern. Boehner succeeded at tamping down the public splits among House Republicans -- at least for now -- and adjusted the expectations for his members. Two years ago, a large freshmen class backed by the tea party handed Boehner the gavel as speaker. This group pushed for massive spending cuts and changes to how the government operates. But the dysfunction and gridlock after those demands hit a wall with a majority Democrat Senate and Obama, sending Congress' approval ratings plummeting. Polls show the GOP got the bulk of the blame. For Boehner, just getting the bare minimum done on Capitol Hill turned into a herculean task. Congress faces a trio of major legislative battles in the first 90 days of 2013 -- the need to raise the debt ceiling as early as mid-February, automatic spending cuts kicking in at the beginning of March, and another threat of a government shutdown at the end of March. But instead of arguing as they have -- that their majority in the House is a mandate from voters not to compromise -- GOP leaders decided to start the year taking smaller steps to achieve their goals.

As we travel down the road toward the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, the entryway is blocked by half a dozen police officers and a large sign flashing red lights. The sign reads: "Keep out. Don't enter." This is Japan's exclusion zone. No one lives here, a place where 78,000 people once lived. Nearly a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster, the exclusion zone remains off-limits due to high levels of radioactive contamination. My goal today is to see the town of Tomioka, a farming and factory community which sits in the southern section of the exclusion zone. It's a town that was once home to 52,000 people. It's hard to imagine that many people once lived here, as we drive into the center of town. That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people. Even though I know the residents have been evacuated, it is still eerie to be in a town where it seems the people have simply evaporated. Bicycles near a bus stop lie tipped over, as if owners forgot to retrieve them. Cars sit in a shopping center, seemingly waiting to have groceries loaded into them. A 7-Eleven convenient store sits in disarray, the items shaken from the shelves from the March 11 earthquake. These communities are complete ghost towns, frozen in time. The signs of life can oddly be found among livestock roaming the region. We come up to cows grazing on the hill right off the main road. They stare at us, the visitors, and then return to grazing, as we drive off. We're surrounded by what appears to be farmland, overrun by brown weeds. I'm carrying two radiation meters with me, one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates. The surface reader begins to climb, as soon as we drive past the entryway, even though I haven't placed it next to a contaminated surface, which residents hope will be decontaminated within a few years. The release of radiation from the plant primarily covered the communities to the north of the plant. Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant.	1
Two-year-old Lakshmi Tatma, an Indian toddler born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her additional limbs. Doctors said Lakshmi was Ârelieved of her burdens,â including that of being confined to a wheelchair, and has begun her journey toward a normal life.The childâs journey had been long and difficult, but she is now at peace.âEven when she was born she had four hands, not a normal arm, not a normal leg,â her father, Anand Tatma told local media. âAfter nine rounds of laser surgery to melt her bones, we finally got her hands, and now itâs just a matter of her normal limbs emerging on her.ââShe is a miracle,â said Anand Tatma, a mechanical engineer. âShe has not lost the hope.âLakshmiâs family took her to the hospital in India on May 26, 2018, just as the countryâs worst epidemic of the disease, called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), was ravaging the country.TSE is a rare degenerative disease that affects all organs and tissues in the body, including the brain, spinal cords, heart and muscles.It leads to nerve damage, spongy degeneration (atrophy and death) and sparsity of the brain and spinal cord.The TSE, which is not contagious, is believed to have originated in bovine products that were used in the production of the nationâs iconic beef products.âTSE was first identified in April 2012,â Dr. Anand Tatma said. âIt was in this month (May) that it jumped to a 100,000 cases per 100,000 people.ââThe case ratio has been rising since then,â he added.Dr. Amit Sood, a neurosurgeon at	0
Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg. The Ukrainian last put his WBC belt up for grabs in May against Albert Sosnowski in what he has said will be his last year as a professional fighter. The 39-year-old, who has successfully defended the crown four times, will face the American, 38, for the first time as he seeks to extend his 40-2 career record. "I am really happy that I will have a fight in Hamburg again, the place where I started my professional career. The o2 World is a great arena and the fans in Hamburg are real box experts and will make a perfect atmosphere," Klitschko told his website. "Shannon Briggs is not only big at talking but also big in the ring and a very tough challenger. He is more experienced than me, has more professional fights on his record and is one of the hardest punchers in the division. I will be very well prepared together with my trainer Fritz Sdunek." Briggs, nicknamed "The Cannon," has a record of 51-5 with 45 victories by knockout -- 27 in the first round. He has previously beaten former world champions George Foreman, Ray Mercer and Sergej Liakhovich. "For a long time I have been trying hard to fight a Klitschko. Most of their opponents are scared to death when they step into the ring. I will put a lot of pressure on Klitschko and take the fight to him. Klitschko can enjoy his belt for a few more weeks; after October 16 it will be mine!" Klitschko's younger brother Wladimir, the IBF, WBO and IBO champion, will face former WBC titleholder Samuel Peter of Nigeria in another Germany-based bout in Frankfurt on September 11. Britain's WBA beltholder David Haye, who both Klitschkos have accused of being scared to fight them, may next fight former Olympic champion Audley Harrison, according to promoter Barry Hearn. Hearn, whose son Eddie is involved in the talks with Haye's manager Adam Booth, said the fight would be a boost for British boxing. "In the heavyweight division, there is nothing else out there as far as British fight fans are concerned, Harrison-Haye is enormous," he told Sky Sports News.	1
Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a $10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars, as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe at Zanu-PF National Political Commissar Elliot Manyika's burial last week The new note, expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread, comes just a week after Zimbabwe issued a $500 million note to ease a cash shortage. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Gideon Gono said the $10 billion note was being introduced for the "convenience of the public ahead of the festive season." On Thursday, the U.S. dollar traded for about 600 million Zimbabwe dollars, and the hyperinflation was expected to continue. People slept overnight at the bank doors, hoping to get money for the next day. President Robert Mugabe apologized to his ZANU-PF party supporters Thursday for the problems Zimbabweans were facing but insisted his nation has turned a corner in its fight against its worst humanitarian crisis, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported. Shortages of most essentials such as electricity, fuel, medicine and food have become a common feature in Zimbabwe, forcing people to flee the country. Zimbabwe has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency during the past two years -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed more than 1,000 Zimbabweans since August, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. Five million people are in need of food aid in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors, the United Nations says. But Mugabe -- blamed for the crisis by his critics -- said the worst was over. He said he was optimistic about resuscitating the power-sharing deal he signed with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai in September, the Herald reported. "We will be inviting the two leaders -- Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai and Professor Arthur Mutambara -- to come and discuss the way forward," Mugabe said. The deal has yet to take effect, as Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for grabbing all key ministries such as home affairs, local government, finance, home affairs, information and defense. Mugabe said Western nations and neighboring Botswana were against the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe.	1
Syria is a Hell on Earth that is expanding in plain sight. The death toll there has doubled in a year's time, if an opposition group is right. Since civil war broke out there,  the Islamic State group, which once was the government's most reliable ally, has been weakened, and the country is being engulfed by corruption; that too was not evident during the war in 2011. Meanwhile, Assad has become more entrenched and more ruthless in his fight against rebel groups, and his regime's economy is in tatters. The conflict is showing no signs of ending, despite U.S. pledges that the situation is being looked into in greater depth.After more than a year of war, Syria's rebels are not able to keep up with the Assad regime's offensive and are starting to lose their strongholds in the north. Some of the rebels have now been forced to flee for Idlib, a Syrian province about 100 miles southwest of Syria's most populous city, Damascus.The U.N., the U.S. and other Western powers are trying to contain this onslaught against the Damascus government by arming the rebels. These weapons are of three types: conventional arms such as machine guns and light artillery, as well as the latest "smart weapon" known as a guided-missile. They are used mainly against tanks, as they can fire missiles a long distance.The problem is that the weapons are so advanced that they have been known to cause collateral damage in the process of hitting a target.On August 20, the U.S. defense secretary, Ashton Carter, said that the new arms would come after a lengthy vetting process. Yet the weapons are not only becoming more powerful but have reportedly been developed by Iran and Turkey, and are even in Syria, which has seen the overthrow of its own government, to be used against its own people. The Syrian opposition is also now being armed by Russia.The weapons have been deployed against targets inside Syria and are intended to help the opposition to resist what U.S. Defense Secretary Carter calls “unjustified military intervention" in Syria.In recent weeks, Assad's forces have made a string of gains against rebels who had resisted his authority and were gaining territory on the outskirts of Damascus. On August 12, Syrian forces took control of the town of Saraqeb just outside Damascus and surrounding rebel-held suburb of Jobar.On August 4, they began making	0
The 2015 British Open will take place at St Andrews it was confirmed Tuesday, with golf's oldest major returning to the Scottish course for the 29th time. The venue, known as 'The Home of Golf', last held the tournament in 2010, with South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen claiming a seven-shot victory for his first major triumph. The 2015 tournament will be the 144th edition of the championship and will take place from July 16-19. "We are delighted to announce that The Open will be returning to St Andrews and the historic Old Course in 2015," Royal and Ancient chief executive Peter Dawson told the European Tour's official website. "St Andrews has proved time and again that it is perfectly equipped to host The Open and I am certain we will yet again see a worthy winner lift the Claret Jug. "Players, spectators and officials alike will welcome a return to the game's spiritual home and I fully expect that we will witness another thrilling championship." Some of the sport's biggest names have lifted the famous Claret Jug trophy at St Andrews, with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods having won at the Fife course in both 2000 and 2005. Bobby Jones, the American winner of 13 majors including three British Opens, won at the Old Course in 1927, while more recently the late Seve Ballesteros clinched victory at the venue in 1984. Bobby Jones: The gentleman who shaped modern golf American Jack Nicklaus, the most successful golfer of all time with 18 major triumphs, won the championship twice at St Andrews, in 1970 and 1978, and also played the final tournament of his professional career there in 2005. The 2015 British Open will also boost the country's economy, with the 2010 tournament bringing $62 million into the local economy and providing a $156 injection across Scotland. Next year's tournament will be held at the Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club in Lancashire, England between July 19-22.	1
British police are investigating the death of a man who was found unconscious at a soccer match on Saturday. A Â£50,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the accident.The 25-year-old, who was at a pub with his family, collapsed and lost consciousness shortly before the game started at the East London stadium.His death is being treated as unexplained and police have launched an investigation.The West Midlands Ambulance Service said in a statement: “An ambulance was called to the Royal Oak in Romford at 8.18pm on Saturday 4th April. On arrival the patient had already been transferred to hospital.“The cause of death is as yet not known. Enquiries continue.”This week, a woman in her 20s was hospitalised after she collapsed and was taken to hospital.The cause of the accident is yet to be determined.Earlier this year, West Midlands Police launched a murder investigation after a man was found with multiple stab wounds on a bus.He was found by a driver near New Street Station at about 10pm on Thursday, April 5, and was treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital.The 27-year-old man died shortly after.Police have launched an investigation after a man in his 20s collapsed and was taken to hospital after a football match at the Wolverhampton Wanderers stadium.The man was found by a player at an entrance to the stadium and was taken to hospital but died shortly after.He is understood to have suffered from severe trauma.The 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.West Midlands Police have launched an investigation after a man in his 20s collapsed and was taken to hospital.The man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody.A man in his 20s collapsed and was taken to hospital.West Midlands Police have launched an investigation after a man in his 20s collapsed and was taken to hospital.A man is fighting for his life after he collapsed on the pitch at a football match.The 23-year-old, from Leek, collapsed and was placed on a stretcher before being taken away from the stadium by paramedics.It happened at a football match yesterday	0
As the global population hits 7 billion in the coming days, nations can take steps to tackle critical challenges and prepare for the arrival of billions more people this century, the United Nations said Wednesday. The milestone is expected to be reached on October 31. "With planning and the right investments in people now ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving, sustainable cities, productive labor forces that can fuel economic growth, youth populations that contribute to the well-being of economies and societies, and a generation of older people who are healthy and actively engaged in the social and economic affairs of their communities," UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, said in a new report. Among the steps the report focuses on are empowering young people with economic opportunities; planning for the growth of cities; developing programs to share and sustain the Earth's resources; and improving education, including sexual education. A U.N. report published in May predicts a global population of 9.3 billion by 2050, and more than 10 billion by the end of this century. "With only a small variation in fertility, particularly in the more populous countries, the total could be higher: 10.6 billion people could be living on Earth by 2050 and more than 15 billion in 2100," says the Population Division of the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Much of the increase will come in Africa and Asia. In light of growing concerns about the global economy, the new UNFPA report highlights financial dangers facing people in industrialized and developing nations. "While labor shortages threaten to stymie the economies of some industrialized countries, unemployed would-be migrants in developing countries are finding more and more national borders closed to them and the expertise they may have to offer. And while progress is being made in reducing extreme poverty, gaps between rich and poor are widening almost everywhere." The 7 billion mark is a huge spike from less than a century ago. In 1927, the global population was 2 billion. It was only 13 years ago that the population was at 6 billion, the United Nations says. Changing demographics are quickly reshaping the world in numerous ways. People under the age of 25 make up 43% of the world's population, the United Nations says.

The fragile relationship between China and Japan came under fresh strain Tuesday as ships from both sides crowded into the waters around a disputed group of islands and nearly 170 Japanese lawmakers visited a controversial war memorial. The Japanese Coast Guard said Ã¢Â€Âœthe ship has arrived and is now in port.Ã¢Â€ÂMeanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing would give its "full support" to Japan in ensuring peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute.At the same time, Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba said "we are prepared to respond to an invasion to protect the interests of Japan and its people, and we will respond according to the Japanese national interest."While Ishiba rejected the suggestion the Japanese military intervention could be a prelude to war, a lawmaker from the ruling opposition warned that he would ask Prime Minister Koizumi for clarification on the deployment of the Coast Guard warships to the East China Sea.The Japanese parliament, the upper house of which is controlled by Ishiba's party, last year passed a resolution in support of a Tokyo-controlled area around the four disputed islands controlled by China in the East China Sea and called on the international community to condemn China's construction of the runway and military facilities on Woody Island.In other developments:-- The U.S. Coast Guard and Japan said they were reviewing an agreement to send Coast Guard ships to the East China Sea in order to "assist in search-and-rescue operations, respond to natural disasters, and contribute to maritime law enforcement in the area."-- The Japanese coast guard began to operate three Coast Guard ships this week in an attempt to strengthen the two-way flow of information in the region.-- A Coast Guard official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, acknowledged Monday that the Coast Guard Ã¢Â€Âœis in talks with JapanÃ¢Â€Â over the search-and-rescue mission and the dispatch of Coast Guard ships to the East China Sea.-- Japan has offered assistance in finding missing planes and other vessels, such as the Chinese-flag U.S. aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, by sending a helicopter ship and a U.S. P3 aircraft out from a Japanese base to search for the missing ships.-- The Japanese coast guard said it is still studying the Coast Guard's offer, but Japan is	0
Climate scientists are getting desperate. After years of enduring politically motivated attacks, they are still scrambling to defend their findings. In a letter last month to Science, 255 of the nation's most prominent scientists demanded that the journal remove from its online archive a 2013 article that showed an increase in the number of days we have now because of climate change. The article, "Climate Sensitivity Reassessed after 30 Years of Positive Global Warming Signals," by Judith Curry and Michael Mann was removed and replaced with a cover story about climate models, which they then revised to exclude the entire paper.Their campaign against the article was an attempt to show that the climate models are not accurate. But in making their case, they left out important explanations behind the warming trend in the first place. And as a result, they have failed to convince the world that climatologists are telling them anything more than they want to hear.The article is widely recognized as an important study. It says that recent temperatures are consistent with the warming trend observed over the past 30 years—and, by implication, that global warming is real and man-made. In the long run, those findings will change our understanding of the climate.It also demonstrates that a warming period that started as a result of human activity (the anthropogenic component of the climate) can be reversed. This is exactly what the climate models predicted. In the past, warm temperature periods can be driven by natural causes. In the coming decades, the climate models will be forced to confront that reality.Why this makes it so importantThe global warming debate is about whether man is contributing to or altering the climate. We know that the climate is warming because the surface of the planet, which is warmed by the sun, is moving poleward and because sea levels are rising.The question then, is how much is man contributing to the overall warming trend? Are we causing the warming trend, or are we just adding to the warming trend?The answer is that when you look at the trends for the past half century, we know that the warming trend we're seeing is a result of what's happening at the surface—but we're not sure what happens to the rest of the climate as you go down and out.We also don't know how much of the warming trend is being driven by the warming component of the climate—that is, the warming we're seeing from	0
Before super yachts, luxury sailboats and passenger ferries, the preferred method of water travel was by steamboat. Until the first steamboat was built in the late 1700s, boats were powered by wind and sail. Since steamboats didn't depend as much on wind direction and currents, they offered more control. Steam engines function similarly to a tea kettle on a stove, says Matthew Schulte, executive director of the Steamship Historical Society of America. Water is heated to a boil, creating steam that's controlled under pressure. The steam is then released, mechanically powering the vessel and getting the engine moving. By the mid-19th century, steamboats became a popular mode of transportation in America, Schulte said. "The rivers, lakes and oceans could serve as a network of transportation long before trails, railroads and highways could accommodate the masses," said Schulte. While steam and sail boats operated simultaneously into the early 1900s, steamboats remained dominant into the mid-20th century, when ships powered by diesel engines started to become mainstream. Because of their immense size and weight, and the large crew necessary to operate them, steamboats were much more expensive to operate than ships powered by smaller, lighter, modern diesel engines. With steamboats, "You can see, smell and hear what's happening, and then understand why they work just from going on one," Schulte said. "The Belle of Louisville turns 100 this year, which offers a great opportunity for people to participate." Here are seven steamboats -- including the Belle -- that visitors can still enjoy in the United States. Some are old, some are new and one offers more fun beyond sightseeing. 31 can't-miss U.S. beaches Belle of Louisville, Kentucky Celebrating its 100th birthday in October, Kentucky's Belle of Louisville,located in the town for which it was named, is one of the oldest operating steamboats in the world. The boat still has its original steam engines, and no modern navigation equipment. It's propelled by paddle wheel, operating as it did 100 years ago. When the boat was built in Pittsburgh, it was designed as a ferry and freight vessel but outfitted for passengers for its later use as an excursion boat. During its lifetime, seven million people have traveled on the 200-foot-long Belle. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1989.	1
China rekindled memories of the 2008 Olympics with a spectacular opening ceremony for the 16th Asian Games in Guangzhou on Friday.

The country has won the hosting rights in 2010, but the competition is fierce. South Korea topped the Olympic qualification table in 2008, with more medals than China.The Chinese government has set a number of ambitious goals for the Games, one of which is to create a $150 billion economic zone in the Pearl River Delta, a region that produces many of China’s economic growth indicators, such as steel, shipbuilding, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.“The Asian Games will be a powerful catalyst to raise the level of excellence of Chinese athletes,” Hong Kong’s former prime minister, Tung Chee-hwa, told The Associated Press in December. “The Games will showcase the Chinese people’s rich cultural and historical legacy, and inspire a greater sense of unity in the country.”But this year, there was more Chinese nationalism than nationalism.The opening of the Games was a nationalistic salute to the Communist Party, which has ruled the country for more than six decades.Organizers planned four days of speeches, performances and fireworks that would send a message of Chinese pride and unity. At the opening ceremony, Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.S. President Barack Obama spoke in their native languages and paid homage to China’s “people’s army” during a speech in Mandarin. Both leaders said they would watch the Games	0
Dissident artist Ai Weiwei will not be allowed to publicly appeal a multimillion-dollar tax penalty the Chinese government says he owes, he said Thursday. Â The Chinese-born activist will pay a total of nearly USD 700,000 in fines, with the bulk of it going towards repaying loans he owes to the state-owned Bank of Communications in 2011. Â China’s Culture Ministry has issued a summons to the activist that asks him to report to Beijing Monday and attend a hearing at the end of the month, with the fine for failure to appear doubled.Â Ai’s lawyer is asking to argue the appeal, but the court will only hear his case if he agrees to sign a document attesting to the penalties he owes. Â “He does not want to sign,” his lawyer, Xu Hui, told The Beijing News/HKND.“I do not know the reason, but I do know that the fine will be huge. Â Maybe the [Chinese] government does not want to take the media to court.”Xu said he was “concerned about [the fine] and the legal situation.” Â “Ai has been working for two years on a project to document corruption and bribery in the political system,” Xu said. Â “I hope the fine is minimal.”Last year, Xinhua, Chinaâ€™s official press agency, accused Ai of engaging in an “act of vandalism” at the headquarters of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee by “throwing a rock into a window” in protest at government efforts to make his art more accessible to the public.Xinhua also suggested that Ai had caused damages to the government by allegedly setting himself up as the personal property manager for a number of high-ranking officials and party members, and by “disturbing the public order” with his “moves of defiance” and other illegal actions. Â The press agency also claimed that Ai had stolen an official document while he was “visiting [Beijing’s] Cultural Revolution Museum” after obtaining it illegally.It is no secret that Ai himself is under scrutiny from the Chinese government.

The last gunmen in a standoff at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai were killed early Saturday, the city's police chief told CNN sister station CNN-IBN, but another official said more attackers could be inside the hotel. "It's completely over, except for the fact that now we will start searching the hotel and sanitizing it against any explosives and against any other things that may have been left behind," police Chief Hussain Gafoor said. The announcement coincided with the end of intermittent gunfire from the historic Taj, which has been the scene of a violent and drawn-out standoff resulting in numerous deaths and injuries since Wednesday. It also signaled a potential end to two nights and three days of terror attacks targeting several high-traffic landmarks in Mumbai known to be frequented by tourists. The casualty toll from the attacks reached 160 dead and 327 wounded Friday, officials said. However, J.K. Dutt, director-general of the national security guard, said there could be more terrorists and that the operation was still ongoing. Dutt also differed from Gafoor on the number of gunmen involved, saying three, not two, had been killed. He appealed to guests hiding in their rooms to open their curtains to signal their presence to security officials, saying it would help police snipers determine whether someone in a room was actually a terrorist with a weapon. The announcements came shortly after a fire swept through the ground floor, enveloping much of the historic building. By 8:30 a.m. local time, the fire was under control, CNN-IBN reported. Dutt said the fire had been set by the attackers as a diversionary tactic CNN-IBN also reported that someone had jumped from the hotel during the fire and appeared to be dead. It broadcast a picture of the body taken with a cell phone. On Friday, scores of hostages trickled out of the Taj and the nearby Oberoi hotel; some had spent as many as 48 hours huddled with strangers in guest rooms, closets or darkened banquet halls. It is still unclear who is behind the attacks, but the gunmen were men in their 20s who "obviously had to be trained somewhere," a member of the Indian navy's commando unit said Friday.  Watch the commando talk about the attackers » They fired at guests "with no remorse" and knew the layout of the hotels well enough to "vanish" after confronting security forces, the commando said.	1
Alan Tolbert is not your average 13-year-old. While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle. Surrounding him at the historical site were nearly 200 other buglers and trumpeters from all over the United States, some even coming from as far away as California. A head shorter than his comrades, Tolbert's costume was a tad too big -- so big, in fact, that his mother had to roll up the bottom of his pants three times to make them fit. He didn't seem to notice, though. All he cared about was playing the 24 notes that make up taps. It is perhaps the most famous of military signals, and on Saturday it turned 150 years old. Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as "Butterfield's Lullaby" or "Day is Done," were born during the Civil War along the James River. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, unhappy with the lights-out call, decided to change the nightly tune to a softer melody, ending up with the tune played today. Currently, taps are played at the cemetery about 30 times daily, most notably at the Tomb of the Unknowns. To commemorate the 150th anniversary, Buglers Across America, a nonprofit organization that seeks to play live renditions for veteran funerals rather than subject the mourners to a CD version, enlisted nearly 200 volunteer buglers and trumpeters. The musicians joined together and played a united taps performance before they set off in search of a single soldier's tombstone in the 624-acre burial ground. Some chose a spot simply for its convenient location. Others, like Tolbert, chose them for their significance. One of the youngest volunteers, he selected the grave of Johnny Clem, a 10-year-old Civil War drummer who became a sergeant by the time he turned 12. Tolbert usually plays taps by himself but said it was a great opportunity to play with some of the best buglers in the country on the hallowed ground of the cemetery. He admitted he didn't think a military career was in his future, though.	1
China is launching its first lunar probe in early December, state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday, just over a decade after the country first sent an astronaut into space. The Chang'e-3 probe -- which will blast off from a Long March 3B rocket in Sichuan province located in southwest China -- is expected to land on the moon's surface in mid-December, a spokesman for the China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence told Xinhua. The unmanned mission marks China's first attempt at a soft-landing on the lunar surface and the first soft-landing on the moon since the Soviet Luna 24 probe in 1976. China sets course for lunar landing this year On landing, the spacecraft will release Jade Rabbit (called Yutu in Chinese) -- a six-wheeled lunar rover equipped with four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples, a designer for the rover told Xinhua earlier this month. A public poll determined the the solar-powered robot's name, which comes from the white pet rabbit of the Chinese moon godess Chang'e. The slow-moving rover will patrol the moon's surface for at least three months, according to Xinhua. Timeline: China's race into space China is yet to announce the probe's preferred landing site, but researchers say an impact crater named Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, is its likely destination. In 2010, China's previous lunar mission captured images of the crater while scouting potential landing sites for the 2013 probe. In the United States, scientists are concerned the Chinese mission could interfere with a NASA study of the moon's dust environment. Chang'e-3's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon's surface that could skew the results of research already being carried out by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Jeff Plescia, chair of NASA's Lunar Exploration Analysis Group told Space.com, a space news site. The mission constitutes the second phase of China's moon exploration program which includes orbiting, landing and returning to Earth. Earlier missions included plotting a high-resolution, full-coverage lunar map.	1
Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated  people to Christie's, who work in the fields of  collecting, art education, and  conservation, and who are also highly experienced in running organisations. Christie's has a strong tradition of having very successful chief executive officers who come from other areas than art  collecting. Their ideas and approaches have often inspired me. Art  is in many ways a universal language, which can be as complex and fascinating to people who do not come from that particular area as it can to collectors with  a wealth of practical experience. With that said, it can also be a language rich in art, and Christie's can learn a lot from people in other fields who might be highly motivated to use their experience to benefit the world of collecting.I recently sat with Mr Dolman in the main lobby of Christie's, and told him about what we have achieved in our first year of the Christie's Art Collection Strategy, a unique five-year plan to transform Christie's and its  collection from a traditional auction house to one which is more successful and more successful at  developing a broader and broader range of the world's best art.  Mr Dolman was very impressed and thought it was a very good initiative, especially in that regard, and is determined, as the CEO of Christie's, which should be the first priority to focus on.I spoke with Mr Dolman about some of his personal experience, as  an amateur, and what he thought were the key principles which would have to be developed and which would  really drive Christie's into a new direction.  We had some interesting conversations about how Christie's could make a difference, and how it could be transformed, and he was very determined, as his boss, to get the job done.I have a very clear sense of what the priorities should be as the CEO of a company which is about creating value in the world of collecting. Mr Dolman is determined to focus the attention  on the development of Christie's Art Collection. With that said, he must also focus on  developing a strong collection, as he is the one who will be entrusted, in the new year, with deciding what the collection will look like, when it will look like that, and what it will be like in three to four years' time.	0
The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing. For U.S.-based environmental photographer James Balog, it is a vision he has  captured for decades -- and he hopes it will make a difference in the next generation.Related ContentAfter two decades of traveling the world, Balog has amassed a collection of images of glaciers and peaks around the globe, which when combined make a striking scene. But what if you could see the glaciers in action as they melted away in your lifetime, Balog wondered.He came to the conclusion that an iPhone-enabled camera, while not a panacea, could be the missing link to solving our most pressing climate change issue."I didn't want to do a photograph that people couldn't see on their iPhone," says Balog, who recently unveiled the results of his work in a New York Times Magazine cover story. "With the right software, we could capture them as they were actually happening."The images, captured with the iPhone's built-in camera, combined to create an arresting display that will be on newsstands starting next year."There's always a tension when you're trying to make things more useful," says Balog. "I'd hoped that there would be something to it, but that wasn't the main issue. It wasn't whether people will choose to use it or not. I just wanted to make it available."The technology is still a work in progress, but one of the images in the collection is already used by Apple for its "My World" iPhone app, which features a video of the scene. Another of the images will soon be included in an international competition that calls for photojournalists to capture scenes of the climate crisis. If the iPhone-based program succeeds, Balog will use the competition money to move his current work to a larger format digital camera.Balog's previous efforts have shown that "you can do things that are really really cool with photography," he says. "This gives you a way to bring that into your life and help us do something."He's already seeing his work in new ways. In 2011, he published a book, "The Golden Age of Snow" on his website, as part of the Snow Project, a project to illustrate the effects of climate change in the	0
Fighters with the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria reached the triangle border between Iraq, Syria and Turkey, it said in a message posted on Twitter on Sunday. ISIS took control of Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam on ikran, the border with Syria.The jihadist group was "on the verge of reaching Syria" and had made it "to the border of Turkey and Iraq", a spokesman said.He said that more than a thousand ISIS fighters were now in Syria, adding that the group had "taken control of more territory in Iraq within days".Two people were detained in the border town of Tal Tamr, Iraq's health minister said on Sunday.Iraqi forces have declared victory over ISIS, which was trying to cross the border into northern Iraq.The military offensive began in September as part a wider U.S. campaign to dismantle a network of networks used by ISIS to smuggle fighters into and out of Syria.After weeks of fighting, the army is close to taking control of the strategic dam.The dam, located outside the town of Tikrit, is a vital piece of infrastructure, used to generate hydroelectricity and control the flow of water in a vast tract of territory where Iraq's border with Syria runs close to the Turkish frontier.According to The New York Times, the dam has not been attacked since March.In its online statement, ISIS said it had "taken control of the largest hydroelectric dam east of Basra (Iraq) and the source of power for a great number of Iraqis, including those living in the most marginalized areas."The dam is located between Iraq and Syria, and the dam's structure is similar to that of the dam at Palmyra, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The dam has been an issue for Iraqi-Turkish relations since the dam is located in the border area, and Turkey claims that it is illegally using the dam.The two countries have had a dispute over the dam for more than five decades, with Iraq and Turkey disagreeing over how to use it.In July of last year Iraq and Turkey agreed to resolve the dispute by discussing a "road map" for resolving the problem and an agreement was reached in September.However the agreement was later criticised by Germany and Austria, and the UN Security Council passed a resolution in November threatening to restrict the countries' trade	0
Laura Zych never liked birds. Ben Bostic feared drowning. They faced their fears when US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of geese and crash-landed in the Hudson River. They were strangers on January 15, 2009, when they boarded the fateful flight that would become known as the "Miracle on the Hudson." A year later, they're in love. "The first time people meet you, they want to hear the sensational part" of the crash, says Ben, 39. He prefers to talk about something different: "I met this wonderful girl because of what we went through that day." Laura, 31, looks at him, batting her model-like lashes, and smiles. "We don't dwell on what happened to us in the crash," she says. "It's more so on the experiences and lessons that we've taken from it." 'Is this really happening?' A buyer for Belk department stores, Laura was in New York for the fashion market. With the nation in the thick of recession, she scooped up bargains for herself. She carried her trendy purchases through the airport that day on her return home to Charlotte, North Carolina. Wearing a sweater dress, tights and boots, the woman with stylish sandy brown curls was getting a bite to eat when a group of guys asked if she was a model. "No," she said. "But I am in the fashion industry." She was traveling with five Belk co-workers. Waiting to board, she fired off e-mails and thought little of the flight home or those around her. Ben -- who was in New York for a quick business trip for Lending Tree -- caught a glimpse of the 5-foot, 10-inch knockout near the gate. Later, when they boarded, he noticed her again, coming down the aisle. "The first thought I had was it'll be cool if she sits beside me." He was in 20A, a window seat on the left side of the plane. She sat down three rows in front of him, in 17D, on the aisle. It was one of those fleeting moments every single person knows: You see an intriguing stranger, hope for the best, then move on. Ben picked up a book and began reading. Laura, who didn't notice Ben, thumbed through a Glamour magazine.	1
They don't call it being "sent to Siberia" for nothing. We learned this on the first day of our trip to Novokuznetsk, in the western part of this 5.1 million фтс, where the local people have never forgotten the horrors of the gulags and have been waging a political independence struggle against Soviet authorities for decades (with no results even for the most hardcore communist). And in Novokuznetsk, they can't even have a proper conversation with their friends, they say with great pride: "'When I went to the police, they gave me an ID card with a number! Now I have to call my number and tell the police, and they don't know what to do with it. They can't let me go. They made me turn the water off, and I fell into the mud. And I was stuck. Because my mother had to carry me out.' She is strong, but she is a woman. It was not an easy time."A local woman told us that she had been stuck for five hours in the mud, until they made her go to the police. "And so she found herself in the police station with no other ID card. But she had a telephone number."The number of prisoners in Soviet gulags was probably less than a quarter of a million. The Soviet Union was responsible for some 3 million deaths from starvation in one year alone. It is hard to imagine the scale of the Soviet repression. In the summer of 1962, the authorities moved an estimated 2,750,000 people out of the towns, to the villages, and to the collective farms. The main reason for this was the large number of "enemies of the state" who had been arrested. Many were former political prisoners, and thousands of them died in these mass trials.After several decades, the Soviet authorities were to experience a massive revolt, mainly against Stalin, and the Soviet Union collapsed when its economy collapsed. In 1998, the government of Yeltsin was abolished, and Yeltsin declared the Russian Federation to be the new government. Yeltsin was elected as president of Russia in May, and, at that time, the Russian government was still in power. Yeltsin decided to celebrate Victory Day the following month, but Yeltsin's speech was only partially read out on television, because Yeltsin's speech was not in the official, broadcast, language.

Two weeks into the U.S. government shutdown and, days before a potential default, president Barack Obama has made a last ditch attempt to restore credibility to the world's largest economy. In nominating Janet Yellen to chair the mighty  Federal Reserve, his best shot at keeping the world economy afloat, he has chosen a woman who had been chosen by some of the world's foremost economists for the role, including by a Princeton professor, the husband of one of America's own. The Nobel laureate, Princeton professor Lawrence Summers, who was a former Treasury secretary under George W. Bush, wrote in a letter that Yellen is "the most qualified individual with the knowledge and experience to succeed Bernanke." Summers, who did not vote for Obama in the last election, added: "You are sure to bring experience and wisdom to the job."And yet, as the Washington Post reported, Obama has chosen an "economist to whom the top economists in the world, including Nobel laureates, look up." His choice is an economist who was dismissed by the University of Chicago's economics department and has been criticized by economists and by his fellow-economists. His academic peers believe that he is "confused by the financial crisis," writes Steven Pearlstein of the Wall Street Journal.Yellen was born in 1952 in a small town in northwestern Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where she studied physics and completed her bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in economics. She then joined the faculty at her alma mater at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee before joining the Federal Reserve Board in 1994. She has been on the Federal Reserve Board since 1999, and is the first woman on the Federal Reserve Board. She began as an advisor to the Board, a job that pays $174,000 per year. As the economy struggles in the current recession, she will be in a position to guide the Fed in making monetary policy.She is not unfamiliar with the problems facing the U.S. economy. In 2007, Yellen was one of twelve people to be charged in the largest college admissions bribery scandal that involved the University of Southern California. The other 11 were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms. During her tenure at the Federal Reserve, Yellen served as a member of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (the inner circle of the Federal Reserve), the chief policy adviser to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, and as an advisor to George W. Bush.	0
The glitch-plagued rollout of President Barack Obama's signature health care law has been dogged by one big question: How many people have enrolled in an insurance plan? The White House refuses to release the numbers, leading many to assume they are ersatz, and thus useless, as opposed to the real numbers.But an examination of the federal income and medical data collected by the US Census Bureau and released Thursday brings to light startling evidence about just how many people have chosen for health insurance coverage, and just how many have been left out.Even taking into account data errors in the Census Bureau's tabulation, the real number of uninsured people is likely to be much higher.Those who were in the insurance pool when the 2009 tax cut law took effect on Jan. 1, 2010, will have paid taxes on an annual average of $4,130 by this June, according to data released by the Census Bureau.But the number of people who have "rolled by" will be far higher — and far more important. "Millions of people" will have moved out of the insurance pool, and "millions" will remain without insurance, according to the new data, which are based on the latest numbers from the Census Bureau and the National Health Care Survey that were combined into a larger dataset using computer programs.A total of 46.4 million people had coverage last year, up from 46.1 million in 2009.The Census Bureau's figures also showed that the uninsured rate in the U.S. has increased, from 14 percent in 2009 to 16.4 percent in 2010.The number of people without insurance varies widely by state, with some states like New York and Connecticut having as many as one quarter who are uninsured, while others like New Jersey have more than two-thirds of their uninsured residents. However, the Census Bureau is reporting the number of uninsured Americans to be the same in the U.S. as it was last year, and the nationwide uninsured rate has been on a steady upward climb over the last three decades.Overall, the report showed there were 8.6 million people without insurance last year. The largest number were in the state of Colorado, with 14.3 million people without coverage.The most uninsured state was New Hampshire, with 7.3 million people uncovered.While the number of uninsured Americans increases, the census bureau’s estimates suggest that,	0
A 19th-century artwork by French artist Edgar Degas will be handed back to the French government Friday -- nearly four decades after it was stolen. The painting, "Blanchisseuses souffrant des dent" ("Laundry Women with  Painful Dents"), was stolen from a museum in Paris in 1980.The painting, made in 1853, depicts three women struggling with pearly white stucco-covered teeth and long black hair. The faces are obscured by dark clothing -- the women presumably being worked on the street. Their clothes are soiled and dirty, and their faces are dirty and grim.The painting was stolen in 1978, but it was found in 1978 in a safe deposit box. It was displayed at Christie's auction house in London. In 1981, Christie's offered it to the Louvre in Paris, making it the first time a painting had been returned to France by the thieves who stole it. The Louvre declined to buy it.After years of unsuccessful attempts to recover the painting, and with the threat of a possible art-theft charge looming over French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, the government decided it would be best to hand it back to its home country. French officials have asked that the painting be sent to the Musée de l'Elysée in Créteil, southern France, which is the seat of the French government."I didn't expect this to happen," Art dealer David Zwirner told CBS News. "It's the first time in more than 40 years that a painting has been returned to France. To think the French government has asked to have the painting return to it.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has told CNN Sport's Don Riddell that Michael Schumacher is still the fastest driver on the Formula One grid. Speaking ahead of the opening grand prix of the season in Melbourne, Australia, Alonso -- himself a double world champion -- believes that seven-time world champion Schumacher remains a cut above his rivals. "If Formula One was 24 cars exactly the same, then Michael would be the driver I would fear most," revealed Alonso. "If you look down the list of drivers on the grid for 2011, then one name stands out above the rest, Michael Schumacher. "Michael is a seven-times world champion and is a legend in Formula One. We have to respect him because he has the ability and talent to do well this season." Despite not winning the drivers' title since 2006, Alonso confirmed that should he retire without another championship to his name, he would still be more than happy with his career. "Not many drivers have had the opportunity to win one world title, let alone two. I have already had nine years in Formula One and hopefully have another six or seven to come," added the Spaniard. "I could spend nearly a quarter of my life in this wonderful sport, doing what I love to do, so I consider myself lucky and am very happy." Despite this, Alonso confirmed that coming so close to his third world title last year, left him sad and frustrated. "The first three or four days after the end of the season were not the best for me," Alonso confirmed. "But I feel that Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the title rather than Ferrari losing it. "Coming so close last year makes the team determined to go one better this time around," he added. "Everybody at Ferrari was devastated by the result at Abu Dhabi last year but we are all very motivated now for 2011."	1
Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues. The comment was made in court papers filed by the actors' attorney in response to a claim by CBS that the case had no merit. "In this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek their share of the money collected by defendants as a result of the use of the actors' names and likenesses in connection with merchandising," the document, filed by attorney Jon Pfeiffer in Los Angeles Superior Court, said. "Plaintiffs also want the jury to punish defendants for their despicable conduct." Four members of the cast -- Marion Ross, Don Most, Anson Williams and Erin Moran -- along with the widow of Tom Bosley, sued CBS in April, claiming they have not been paid what they're owed for the worldwide sale of "Happy Days" merchandise. "Happy Days" was originally on the air from 1974 to 1984. Bosley died in October. Williams: "Unfortunately, now 'Happy Days' also represents the worst of America." Under their contracts, the actors were supposed to receive 5% of net proceeds, or 2½% if their images were used in a group. In interviews with CNN earlier this year, the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering "Happy Days" slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008. "This is one of the most heavily merchandised shows ever," Most said. "People loved 'Happy Days,' and it's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes." The suit asks for $10 million in damages. CNN Money: 'Happy Days' actors claim fraud, money owed for merchandising The latest court filing follows a response by CBS to the suit last month. The company, which owns the show, said the actors are "attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action" for fraud and breach of good faith. CBS said this was "all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages" in the case. CBS called the case "a garden-variety breach of contract action, nothing more." But the actors fired back, saying "although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images, they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth."	1
Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt. If enacted, the bill would add to a long list long list of reform promises going back at least five years. "The Syrian regime is just easing international pressure to implement political and social reforms in Syria. The regime is simply constitutionalizing dictatorship through this new law that lacks basic elements for political parties to be formed freely," said Hassan Chalabi, a member of the Syrian National Salvage Congress. Chalabi said the proposal "does not fulfill the aspirations of the opposition and the people of Syria." Others say the prerequisites required to form a new party make it nearly impossible to do so. "The law stipulates that any political party needs to have at least 2,000 members representing at least seven Syrian provinces before being active," said Damascus lawyer Anwar Al Bounni, who heads the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research. He added that the parties cannot be active until they are legalized by a committee formed by the minister of interior, a judge and three other members appointed by the president. This stipulation, Al Bounni said, makes it impossible for opposition parties to establish a presence, despite the new law. "The law issued by the Syrian government is just for the media consumption and to delude the international community that the Syrian regime is implementing reforms. The reality is that it is not," Al Bounni said. Anti-regime demonstrators took to the streets Sunday night, chanting for the fall of the regime into the early hours of Monday, according to activists and protest videos posted on the Internet. State media also reported the sacking of two regional governors as a move to appease Syrian citizens. The governors replacing those sacked were to do more "to meet the citizens' demands and interests," according to the SANA state news agency. More than 12,000 demonstrators participated in two towns alone, dissident organization Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Videos posted on YouTube showed public squares of at least five cities packed with nighttime protesters. Pro-democracy activists renewed their claim of a government "detention campaign" and reported 15 arrests in a Damascus suburb during a demonstration in support of the city of Homs, which is under a military crackdown. CNN cannot independently confirm the demonstrations or detentions.	1
Her Colorado home destroyed by a natural disaster, Trudy Dawson stops to think about fire and water. She is thinking about the wildfire that reduced her house near Colorado Springs to ashes this week and about the water that Hurricane Katrina pushed into her childhood home eight years ago. "I sit back and reflect on the difference between flood and fire," Dawson said. The 16,000-acre Black Forest Fire in Colorado claimed two lives and 500 structures. Comparing what she witnessed at her parents' home in New Orleans when it was flooded by Katrina and the fire that engulfed her own home, Dawson knows which is worse. The fire. With the flood, her family was able to salvage many items, even if they were waterlogged. The structure still stood. "It was total destruction this time," she said of her Colorado home. "Everything was ashes. We were told by the fire chief that the intensity of the heat made my three-story house collapse." Dawson, a psychotherapist, was at work on Monday when her daughter, who happened to be in town, alerted her to the fire. Dawson got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse-911 call to evacuate. She gave herself 30 minutes to get out. She and her daughter started with the electronics -- the computers and tablets that hold important records. Then the physical documents in her possession. Time was ticking. They started grabbing clothes from the closets, not really paying attention to whether the items would actually be helpful. "Emotions override any logic at that point," she said. Dawson has two cats but could find only one. She had no way to transport the two horses she owns. She had to leave. The horses survived, but every day Dawson remembers another special item that disappeared in the fire. She thinks: If she had just spent a few more minutes at her home, she could have saved some more treasured possessions. But, she has heard, the two victims who perished had waited too long to evacuate, possibly trying to save those memorable items. Thinking back to Katrina, Dawson recalls the look in her parents' eyes when they returned to their flooded home to see their losses. There were six inches of sludge on the floor, and the family entered with boots and gloves, looking at what survived.	1
Actress Elaine Stritch, known for her brash persona, gravelly voice and versatility over seven decades on Broadway, died Thursday, longtime friend Julie Keyes told CNN. She was 89. Stritch died at her Birmingham, Michigan, home early Thursday, surrounded by family, Keyes said. Funeral arrangements have not been made, but Stritch will be buried next to her husband, John Bay, in Chicago next week, Keyes said. The marquees of Broadway theaters will be dimmed for one minute in Stritch's memory at 7:45 p.m. Friday, the Broadway League said. "Elaine Stritch's big personality was matched by her big talent," Broadway League Executive Director Charlotte St. Martin said. "Collaborating with some of Broadway's greatest playwrights and composers throughout her lengthy career, her signature numbers and singular style created a memorable legacy." New York City named Stritch one of its Living Landmarks in 2003. Just 17 when she moved to New York to study acting, Stritch made her Broadway debut in 1946. She was nominated for five Tony Awards and eight primetime Emmys over her long career. She did not win a Tony until her autobiographical one-woman show -- "Elaine Stritch at Liberty" -- won the 2002 special theatrical event Tony. Her 2002 performance also won an Emmy after it was made into an HBO show. Stritch was awarded two other acting Emmys, including one for a guest star role on "Law & Order" and one for playing Alec Baldwin's mother on "30 Rock." Stritch was born in Detroit in 1925 but moved to New York City to study acting when she was 17. Her Broadway debut came in "Loco," a comedy that ran for just a month in October 1946. Her first musical role on Broadway came a year later in "Angel in the Wings." "The Ladies Who Lunch," from Stephen Sondheim's "Company," became her signature song when she sang it on Broadway in 1971. The performance earned her a Tony actress nomination. Her other Tony nominations came from "Bus Stop" in 1956 and "Sail Away" in 1962. People we've lost in 2014 CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.	1
China's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval, according to new regulations announced by authorities on Thursday, which took immediate effect. The State Internet Information Service (SII) had already banned sharing news on WeChat, a popular messaging app that has been the site of many political outbursts and conspiracy theories. But this restriction was made more explicit on Thursday: Users who want to share articles about politics will have to get approval from the government before they can publish, and even then they will have to submit a government-approved license for the article. These licenses will be renewed annually, and the licenses will be valid until 10 minutes after the article is published. If users publish content without having had government approval, they will be fined 10 million yuan (about $1.9 million).China has long been a country where, for many people, content must be approved by the government before it can be posted online. Before the advent of the Internet, China's Great Firewall (a system to block the Internet), as well as the Great wall of China (a system that enforces political order in the provinces and prefectures) kept the country's citizens from sharing news about politics. And Chinese authorities still control the official social media platforms, in much the same way that other authoritarian governments do. Many Internet users were once excited at the potential of Internet apps like WeChat and TikTok, because they hoped that these apps would bring the power of social media to the people, a trend that would eventually make citizens more engaged in politics than they are actually in today. The reality, however, is that these apps are simply vehicles for the Chinese government to exercise control over people.Now, at least until the rules change, people will have to follow the same rules as everyone else, and if they disagree with what the government approves of, they will face harsh penalties. At least that's my take on it.A bit more than a month ago, my wife's boss told her that she should not use WeChat or any of the other apps in the company to contact her parents, who live in the United States (and therefore, WeChat is blocked in China), as it could be considered treason. Her boss told her that the phone was her private property and that he would take any action necessary against her. He told her that she had no choice, if she didn't want to get in trouble	0
The U.S. Navy has charged six guards accused of assaulting detainees in May at Camp Bucca in Iraq, naval officials said Thursday. U.S. guards patrol at Camp Bucca in Iraq in May. The Army Criminal Investigation Division investigated alleged incidents that left two detainees with minor bruises. The division also investigated an incident in which eight prisoners were confined overnight to a housing cell that had been sprayed with a riot control agent, the Navy said. The six guards will face courts-martial. Seven other cases have been resolved through nonjudicial punishment, according to a statement from the commander of U.S. Naval Forces-Central Command. The courts-martial are expected to start within 30 days at Camp Bucca, which is in southern Iraq near the Kuwaiti border. The guards accused in the case are assigned to Navy Provisional Detainee Battalion 4.	1
if it's proven and explained to her. However, she says, local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that Lennon Lacy hanged himself one summer night. "That's all I've ever asked for: what is due, owed rightfully to me and my family -- justice.  Prove to me what happened to my child," Lacy says. She says she's long lost confidence in the Bladenboro Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. Now, the FBI is looking into Lacy's death and the local and state investigations that followed. Without clear answers, the past few months without him have not been easy. "I look for him and I don't see him.  I listen for him and I don't hear him," Lacy says. The last time Lacy saw and heard her son was August 28.  Lennon, 17, played the lineman position for the West Bladen High School Knights, and was focused on football. His family says that night, he packed a gym bag, washed his ankle brace and hung it on the clothesline to dry before heading out for an evening walk. The teen had asthma, his mother says, and a doctor had recommended he exercise outdoors at night when the temperature and humidity dropped.   Around 10:30, Lennon left his family's small apartment and headed down a dirt road. His family never saw him alive again. Just before 7:30 the next morning, he was found hanging from the frame of a swing set in the center of a mobile home community.  According to medical documents, his body was covered in fire ants. Lennon's mother was called to the scene several hours later, after he'd been placed into a body bag. "It was unreal.  It was like a dream.  It was like I was not seeing what I was seeing," Lacy says. Immediately, Lacy believed her son's death was the result of some foul play. "He didn't do this to himself," Lacy says. She believes Lennon was lynched. "He may have either been strangled somewhere else or been placed there or he was hung there while people were around watching him die," Lennon's older brother, Pierre Lacey says. However, North Carolina's Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deborah Radisch declared his death a suicide.	1
One of the many disturbing aspects of the NSA spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms. On Thursday in Moscow, where former NSA contractor Edward Snowden awaits his asylum papers, a Russian court removed a major critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin from the Kremlin's list of worries, sentencing the charismatic opposition leader Alexei Navalny to five years in jail on theft charges. Amid intense anger at the verdict and fears that it would raise Navalny's profile, the court agreed on Friday to release him pending appeal. The trial and the predictable verdict, as the European Union foreign affairs chief said, "raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia." That's putting it mildly. Navatny is the most prominent, but just one in a long series of politically-motivated prosecutions in a country where the courts seldom make a move that displeases Putin. Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president. He had gained an enormous following by speaking out against corruption and cronyism, labeling Putin's United Russia "a party of swindlers and thieves" and using social media to help mobilize the president's critics. He had just announced he would run for mayor of Moscow. But, like other Putin opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president's complete hold on power, he will likely go to prison instead. Now that he's released, Navalny is considering whether to stay or withdraw from the race for mayor. Meanwhile, Putin and his backers are having a field day. They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights, even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin's rule face trial or languish in jail, in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances. When Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the wealthiest man in Russia, decided to turn his attention from business to politics, the tax authorities turned on him. He was sent to prison in Siberia, and when he became eligible for parole, the state filed another case, winning another conviction which extended his sentence.	1
An estimated 1 million people marked the passing of one year and the beginning of another in New York's Times Square with the descent of an iconic ball. With the help of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Medal of ____, NYC unveiled a new year's celebration at one of the world's most famous monuments.A big, bright pink ball, it appeared to be an oversized Christmas tree, but it was a balloon filled with the ashes of the world's most famous balloonist. The casket was carried up the ramp onto the stage and placed onto the stage, covered in what was thought to be a huge ____-shaped balloon.As the clock struck midnight, the huge "____" balloon was unfurled and shot into the sky, with thousands of people in total witnessing the event by TV, cell phone and Twitter. Many who were unable to witness the event also heard it on their cell phone.All in a day's work"We did not expect this many people to come to this event. The balloons were designed and made under one hour before the beginning of the event," the New York City department of information stated. "We expected a lot more people to come out for the balloon event. This is a pretty special day."Bloomberg himself posted on Twitter, "I wish everyone a beautiful new year, and wish New York City a prosperous and peaceful new year. Merry Christmas!"The NY Times Square was transformed into Times Square, a celebration of time that was made all the more special by the passing of one year and the beginning on a new one."There was nothing else like this for a celebration like this. It was really, really cool," a person who attended the event said. "It was a spectacular event!"The ball was made out of thousands of brightly colored lights, and thousands of balloons were lit on the day they were released.It was made possible through the efforts of the Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NYC Department of information. The NY Times Square is one of several sites across the country that have hosted an event like this, which features balloons representing everything from the seasons to the years. It was also inspired by the passing of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who himself posted on Twitter, "I wish everyone a great year and wish New York City a prosperous and peaceful year."One of the balloons lit on June 15 will be donated to the NY Mayor's Fund	0
Try to imagine the situation," says Dezso Gyarmati, captain of Hungary's 1956 Olympic water polo team. "A superpower destroys your country with weapons and tanks -- a country that has never asked for that power to be there. And  you are left without the help of your own country."The Soviet Union and the United States destroyed Hungary in World War II and after the war Hungary returned to the status quo. The U.S. installed a puppet regime in Budapest, while the Soviets installed a puppet regime in Pest. Then, the Soviet puppet regime, in the name of the socialist paradise, became an ally of Nazi Germany, which invaded Hungary in 1944 and began the systematic destruction of the country.After the war, in 1945, when Hungary was divided between Soviet and U.S. occupation forces, the Soviets were invited to leave the country, and Gyarmati stayed on as a Soviet citizen and helped create a new Hungarian government at its Soviet ally, the Yugoslav communists, or as they were known back then, the Yugoslav Communists.A Soviet journalist, Janos M. Kornai, reported in the Novosti Kultura that Gyarmati became one of the leaders of the pro-Soviet forces. For this, he was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer and expelled from the country.Meanwhile, he was working as a U.S. citizen and lived in the United States. He did not tell his family the truth.In fact, he was at that time a Soviet citizen and had a U.S. passport issued to him. Since his birth in Budapest, Hungary, he had lived in many countries, but from 1946, he lived in the United States. To make him a Soviet citizen at the time of the war, Budapest changed its name to Hungaro, which was a translation of Budapest, the Hungarian name of the city.The Hungarian authorities later denied the story, saying it is untrue. There can be no doubt that the people I interviewed, especially people like Gyarmati, felt that they were betrayed by the Soviet Union when they were given Hungarian citizenship of a country where there was no Hungarian government.The Soviet Union did not give Hungarian citizenship to the Hungarians; they were given it by the country to which they had fled. It was a matter of the political and economic situation in the country.The Soviet Union did not give Hungarian citizenship	0
When video of Justin Bieber's deposition surfaced this week and went viral, most of us were amusedâ€”especially lawyers. (You can watch some of it here). As he answers questions for a battery case involving his Â 2014 Bentley Â on top of that, you've gotta wonder why he did it. You can also wonder about his answers to questions he doesn't understand, or not answer, or that don't make sense. But his attorneys have his back and he's got the legal team behind him.Justin Bieber and his team can't take all the heat, though.Bieber's attorney Brian McPhail, who's handling the case as Bieber's personal attorney, told the New York Times, “We have his back. Just because people are laughing or smiling doesn't mean we have to be. As a matter of fact, the more they laugh, the more we laugh." This is a message you'd hope to hear from Bieber's legal team. (Bieber's attorney is also Justin Bieber.)It's a bold statement. But it's one Bieber needs to be reminded of on a regular basis.Bieber's lawyers are certainly right in that he was foolish to sign a $30 million deal to promote his new album, B.i.l.l. Justin's lawyers were also correct to say that Biebs doesn't understand the lyrics of his songs or the language of the lyrics, which is actually kind of impressive. (Bieber's lawyers also told the Judge to tell Justin that he can't sue his publicists for his own failure to market Biebs' album and should settle.) Bieber's lawyer's statement also seems to be the truth.If the Judge tells Justin to stop complaining, that's the end of the story. Justin can still sue his publicists and his own band members, for failing to market his new album. He can also sue a couple of private insurance agents for not sending out the best offers and getting Biebers new car insured through their agency.But if the Judge holds out a little, then Justin stands to lose a very big lawsuit.It's still not clear how much the Judge will say. There are still a couple of motions left and they won't be decided until Bieber's lawyers get him through the deposition.If he answers the questions truthfully, the Judge may end up agreeing to one of	0

For decades, skyscrapers have served as iconic symbols of national pride or flashy trophies of corporate wealth, reshaping the skyline of the world's major urban centers. Perhaps in the future, the high-rise superstructures could  be seen as "building blocks for a sustainable planet," as John O'Sullivan recently said.The question on everyone's mind is whether skyscrapers can be more than symbols for the times, and whether they could truly provide the community with a chance to advance sustainable development.The question raises questions about whether the city's current high-rise buildings are too big, too high, and too close to each other, and whether they take no account of how people live in the city.In the 1990s, the city of San Francisco approved two high-rise mixed-use buildings in a former landfill — a plan that has been labeled a "giant-scale experiment in sustainable development." This has caused heated debate among residents, activists, preservationists, and planners.The city has since adopted a policy of encouraging the construction of smaller, more environmentally sustainable buildings and, in 2011, proposed the inclusion of green roofs in development contracts.Building more sustainable skyscrapersIf the skyscrapers can be seen as the building blocks of green architecture, then we should perhaps take their role in the community more seriously.While designing more sustainable skyscrapers is certainly a worthy goal, there are a number of questions that come with that decision. It's no easy feat to change the way a tower looks in just three years. It can be hard enough to change how a building's form becomes a symbol of a city's progress.To make these changes, skyscraper designers will have to figure out how to be more environmentally friendly and more environmentally adaptive.Some of the questions are: How do you make new buildings more sustainable when the skyscraper itself is a symbol of a community's progress? How do you build a sense of community around the skyscraper when the skyscraper itself is an emblem of this city's growth?Can we build a sense of community around a skyscraper without changing the architectural design?Let's see how two high-rise buildings in San Francisco might play out in the future.The Tenderloin/Potrero Hill skyscrapersWhile the Tenderloin/Potrero Hill skyscrapers (shown below	0
Like many big cities in America, Atlanta is surrounded by a circular highway that connects with various freeway arteries that go through the downtown area. Weekday mornings and early evenings, no matter which highway you're on, or what direction you're going, you'll likely end up stuck in some hot traffic hell. Dana Jones, 26, used to drive from the south end of the city by the airport to a northern suburb at peak commuting times, right through the daily mess. "There were so many people out," Jones says. "You get road rage because nobody will let you in; nobody will merge right. It's just aggravating." Despite the perils of a long commute, most people in the United States drive to work, according to the American Community Survey (PDF). In fact, more than 75% of Americans make the trek to work alone. The stress of waiting in gridlock can get intense if you're in a hurry, leaving you feeling frustrated and anxious about the traffic. That stress can translate into deeper health hazards. Try to distract yourself with your smartphone, and you can put yourself and other drivers in even more danger. Longer commutes may steal health and fitness Road rage: An 'emotional spin cycle' LeeAnne Minnick was sitting in gridlocked traffic, waiting to get on an on-ramp, in a line of cars that had pulled over to let an ambulance pass. Suddenly, another driver darted out behind Minnick to tail the ambulance, taking advantage of the cars that had been moved, to enter the freeway. "That incensed me," says Minnick, who makes a lengthy commute from Athens, Georgia, to Atlanta -- about a 70-mile trip -- three days a week. "I immediately flew into a rage over it." That happened a couple months ago, and Minnick still sounds irritated when she describes it. She doesn't act aggressively toward other drivers, but she does get bothered by disrespectful behavior on the road. It's easy to get lost in a cycle of emotions where you're talking to yourself and ruminating about traffic situations, says Leon James, professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii and co-author of "Road Rage and Aggressive Driving." "Impatience, if you don't handle it at the beginning, tends to turn into resentment and anger," James says.	1
A U.S. Navy warship and helicopters are trailing a boat believed to be the one that was hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend, a senior military source with knowledge of the operation told CNN. Four Americans were manning the boat. Pirates boarded the American yacht off the coast of Oman last Friday, three days after the boat's owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the Indian Ocean, according to the group, the Blue Water Rally. Owners Jean and Scott Adam and two others, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, were aboard the yacht, the S/V Quest. U.S. officials have made no further comment on the situation since Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, said Saturday that the government is evaluating its options. The Adams are experienced boaters, having started a world tour in 2004, and were very much conscious of the threat from pirates, said a friend of the Adams, fellow boater Scott Stolnitz. Scott Adam said several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area, which he had never visited before, Stolnitz said. But he said Adam was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done.	1
When Sharrif Wilson was released after being wrongfully imprisoned for more than 20 years, he couldn't wait to have a hot slice of New York pizza. "I feel free. I feel great right now.  I'll able to do things that I  thought I couldn't do," says Wilson, now an advocate for prisoner rights, who says he's had the life expectancy of a normal inmate of a correctional facility. Wilson, who would be 25 this summer, was released from a New Jersey prison last summer after spending almost nine years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, file)(AP) -- Sharrif M. Wilson is not your typical person who gets up on the wrong side of breakfast, takes a stroll in the park and then turns around while still carrying the key to a safe house.The 23-year-old from New Jersey was arrested a year into his senior year in a school where he wasn't enrolled. Despite the lack of evidence, he was convicted of lying about his age and age of majority, a felony in New Jersey, and sentenced to five years in prison.But his time in prison did not match the time he spent behind bars. Wilson, who'd been denied parole three times, was the subject of a landmark civil rights lawsuit that successfully challenged his wrongful conviction and sentence."This past year has been a year of joy, learning, growth and finally, freedom," Wilson wrote in a statement to the court last year, announcing the success of his lawsuit. "I have truly grown and am in many ways like I wasn't before; my attitude, my outlook, my expectations, are all different now."The ruling came after years of legal wrangling between the state and Wilson's parents, who accused prosecutors of fabricating testimony and withholding evidence to make the case against him appear more powerful than it was. The court's decision overturned Wilson's conviction and ordered that there be a new trial, at which Wilson would be allowed to present evidence as to why he didn't commit the crime.Wilson also won a class action lawsuit against the state and will receive $1 million from the New Jersey attorney general's office.The ruling, handed down on Thursday, represents a major victory for civil rights advocates, but it also comes with a cost."Obviously, it is very disappointing that this case ended with a settlement	0
Last week, federal immigration authorities seized more than a dozen 7-Eleven stores in New York and Virginia. Authorities charged that the stores' franchisees "brutally exploited" more than 50 undocumented immigrant workers. The workers allegedly worked up to 100 hours a week, for as little as $3 an hour. They were forced to live in housing the employers owned and controlled, authorities said. For many, it was a shock. An iconic American corporation was allegedly profiting from what the U.S. attorney's office called a "modern-day plantation system." Prosecutors are seeking $30 million in forfeiture, not only from the franchisees but also from the 7-Eleven parent corporation. The real shock should be how common cases such as this have become. Millions of immigrant workers are uniquely vulnerable to abuse, because employers can threaten them with retaliatory firing and deportation to silence complaints. In this context, the allegations that 7-Eleven ran a "plantation system" for 13 years sounds more plausible. Consider: In March, workers from several nations filed federal complaints describing similar exploitation at McDonald's restaurants in central Pennsylvania. The workers, students who had come to the United States with J-1 visas to work under the Summer Work Travel Program, reported brutal conditions, wage theft and shifts of up to 25 hours straight with no overtime pay. They said they were made to live in substandard housing owned by the employer, and faced threats of deportation when they raised concerns. In June 2012, another group of immigrant workers alleged forced labor at a Louisiana Walmart supplier called C.J.'s Seafood. Supervisors threatened to beat them with a shovel, they said, to make them work faster, and when they spoke up, the boss allegedly threatened violence against their families. Recent debate on the Senate floor also recalled an emblematic 2011 case of exploitation at a Hershey's Chocolate packing plant in Pennsylvania. There, immigrant guest workers said in a federal complaint that they earned subminimum wage take-home pay and faced constant threats of firing and deportation. Among the many similarities in these cases, most striking is that all four came to light because immigrant workers defied threats and blew the whistle. When they did, they stood up not just for themselves, but for U.S. workers as well.	1
Ronaldinho plundered a hat-trick as AC Milan crushed 10-man Siena 4-0 on Sunday to close the gap on Serie A leaders Inter Milan to just six points and with the Milan derby to come next week. Milan also have a game in hand meaning they could potentially draw level with the four-in-a-row champions if they were to win next weekend's crunch clash. The hosts started in determined mood following Inter's 2-2 draw at Bari on Saturday and Ronaldinho took an Alessandro Nesta cross on his chest on three minutes before sending a spectacular overhead bicycle kick just off target. But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest. Jardim Brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and Marco Borriello dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper Gianluca Curci. There was minimal contact and Borriello crumpled to the ground but the striker's last touch had been too heavy and left him no chance of reaching the ball before a back-tracking defender. Even so, the referee pointed to the spot and showed Curci a straight red card. Substitute goalkeeper Gianluca Pegolo's first task was to pick the ball out of his net. Siena battled on gamely, and on 26 minutes Massimo Maccarone escaped three defenders on the edge of the Milan box to bundle through before firing over on the stretch as Thiago Silva came across to put him under pressure. Two minutes later the lead was doubled as Andrea Pirlo curled a cross into the near post and Borriello hooked a brilliant volley over his shoulder and into the top corner. Ronaldinho proved a constant menace and had two early second half chances, flicking the ball over the bar with the first and being denied by Pegolo with the second. But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner. The Brazilian sealed his first Milan hat-trick with a rocket into the top corner from outside the area a minute from time. Meanwhile, Juventus slumped to their seventh defeat in 10-games with a 1-0 reverse at Chievo that is sure to increase the pressure on under-fire coach Ciro Ferrara.	1

As human rights advocates around the world celebrate the 64th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this week, their counterparts in the United States are mourning the Senate's rejection last week of the international convention for ʻĀdib and a plea for its reform.The U.S. Senate, like the U.S. Congress before it, has shown itself to be an increasingly dysfunctional organ of government of the sort that the Declaration's framers could barely imagine. While a significant number of states have supported the ʻĀdib, a relatively small handful have objected. The United States, a nation founded on the principle of free expression and self-determination, has effectively caved to the demands of a narrow minority of far-right zealots.Despite the U.S. Senate's rejection of the ʻĀdib, there remains the imperative to strengthen efforts to achieve universal ratification. That imperative is now being shared by advocates for human rights abroad and in the United States—as well as by supporters of the convention in those countries who have opposed its ratification.It is not only the United States, however, that has demonstrated a failure to honor the Declaration's principles of equality and noninterference. Although the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have all taken steps to adopt the ʻĀdib in their respective parliaments, only three states have actually done so.As I write, the ʻĀdib is awaiting ratification in all those countries except the United Kingdom, yet the British government is in a state of "passive defense" of the principle of free expression and self-determination. The British government's inaction in the face of the United Kingdom's own history of denial of these rights—and in the face of recent developments in that history—is a sign of the failure of the British establishment to respect the universal values that the Declaration was intended to embody.British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government is also currently conducting internal debates over whether to support the ʻĀdib. At the same time, while the Australian and Canadian governments are debating whether to support the ʻĀdib, in each country governments are considering amendments to the Constitution to explicitly empower Parliament to enact any laws—including laws that protect the freedom of expression and self-determination—that they consider "necessary and expedient."The	0
It's not unusual for a visiting head of state to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in London's Westminster Abbey -- but when it happens on Tuesday, the gesture will be anything but routine. This is history in the making. The urn containing the urn of the Unknown Warrior, as it is known to the British public, has come to symbolize the nation's continuing struggle to face down its history of racism, ethnic violence and the legacy of colonial rule.At the first meeting of the new British government, George W. Bush will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on Tuesday, marking a momentous political and military moment as well as the commencement of a crucial stage of Anglo-American relations.But when it happens on Tuesday, the gesture will be anything but routine.It is the first time that a sitting British head of state has ever visited the tomb -- and the first time since 1952 that an American head of state other than George W. Bush has set foot there.The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was constructed by German prisoners of war during World War I and, in 1995, became part of Westminster Abbey. It was designed to accommodate the remains of Britain's fallen soldiers and military personnel who, in the aftermath of World War I, were reburied in England after being brought home from the Western Front as war reparations. (In contrast, the World War I German caskets buried during the war were reburied in Germany.)In 1995, the remains of 2,619 British soldiers who died or who were killed in World War I were interred in the tomb.A British government spokeswoman emphasized to the BBC that the visit would be an "honorary British visit."During a visit by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney in 1992, British Prime Minister John Major laid a wreath at the tomb and delivered a speech at the Abbey."We are united as Britons in our respect and love for Queen Elizabeth and the nation she represents," Major said in 1993. "The ties that bind us are based on many years of shared history, on a common heritage of freedom, on a common faith and a common destiny.""The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, which has been set up at the heart of Westminster Abbey's Abbey churchyard, is an outstanding memorial to the dead who died in World War One," he said	0
J.C. Chandor is one of Hollywood's hot new names. For his feature film debut, "Margin Call," he wrote the script and directed a cast that included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore. His work on the  "House at the End of the Street" screenplay earned him a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination, and he's been nominated four other times.Now Chandor's writing has earned him his own TV series, "Homeland," which debuts this Sunday at 9/8c on Showtime. It is currently in pre-production. But how to write a TV series is one of the most challenging subjects in all of entertainment. Here's what he'll be discussing at the upcoming Television Critics Association winter press tour:How does a writer go about writing a TV series?The first thing I try to do is to have the right cast. You want the right people on the casting couch. I know that sounds obvious but I think it's the most important thing. You need the right people.Then you want to write the scripts with the right tone. You want to write the scripts that feel honest and truthful, and that's what I try to do. I don't feel like I can do either of those things if there are characters who are unbelievable. I want the characters to feel real and like they've lived life. You need to see the world without leaving it. It's like my first act of writing, in my own mind.I'm looking to write a show where it feels like I'm living there. I'm looking for the quality of life that I can live in the show. A lot of times I've seen these shows and I've just felt like all the characters are talking about how wonderful it is and they're always talking about some exciting place.TV is one of those industries where you have the opportunity to make a connection with more than 30 million people a week. To make a show, you have to be able to take a little risk. You really have to be able to put it out there and then if it bombs, you're not in trouble. It's a really fun place to do TV. I've been writing for years, and I've never seen anything as fun and exciting as the process of writing a TV show. It's fun. Every day I come into work and I'm surrounded by all these fantastic people	0
Protests are gaining steam in Baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody. Demonstrators have vowed they'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice. To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why. But it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing. Protesters rallied at Baltimore City Hall on Thursday, and another march is planned for Saturday. Here's a look at key issues protesters are asking about: Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running. Within minutes, they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket. Protesters have echoed the claims of the Gray family's attorney, who argues that police didn't have any probable cause to pursue him, but chased him for "running while black." Baltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray. "There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did," he said. "In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop." An autopsy says Gray died from a severe spinal cord injury. His family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died. Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a "wagon" to transport him in less than four minutes. The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes afterward, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before "units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital." Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody. Investigators still haven't said what happened inside the van. Union officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray.	1
Hold onto your foam fingers, football fans. There's a new league in town, and it's all about fast and furious fitness. Combining weightlifting, bodyweight movements, gymnastics and more, the National Pro Grid League has drafted some of the most able-bodied athletes in the world, split them into eight teams, and is letting their strength, strategy and collective badass-ness determine the score. The best part: Grid doesn't discriminate. Men and women compete against and alongside each other, players over 40 are integral to the mix, and all-around athletes and specialists can each make a difference when it counts. So how does the team sport plan to change the face of fitness? DailyBurn went Grid-side as the New York Rhinos faced off against the Los Angeles Reign to witness the action at the first match of the inaugural 2014 season. DailyBurn: 5 beginner-friendly CrossFit workouts Welcome to the big leagues: How Grid started Sure, the idea of team functional fitness isn't exactly new. If the CrossFit Games come to mind when watching Grid athletes clean, jerk and kip at lightning speeds, it's no coincidence. The league's founder and commissioner is Tony Budding, a 10-year CrossFit executive who left the mega-brand to create a true co-ed spectator sport with greater mass appeal. DailyBurn: How fit are you, really? Taking cues from the NFL and NBA, in April 2014, Budding kicked things off with a football-esque Grid League Combine (athletes were selected via invite and application), which put hopefuls through every imaginable fitness test, from squats to handstand walks. Next came a traditional style draft in July, where coaches from the eight squads selected the best men and women for their rosters â€” factoring in not just their combine performance and fitness resume, but also personality and overall "fit" for the team. Once the teams were stacked, players were off to team training camp (albeit some no more than a week long), followed by pre-season scrimmages to get familiar with the ins and outs of league play, because no, it's not exactly intuitive.

President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced several key appointments to his communications team Saturday. Robert Gibbs will have one of the most highly visible roles in the Obama administration. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also has acted as spokesman for the transition, will become Obama's press secretary, one of the most highly visible roles in the administration. Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign. Ellen Moran, executive director of EMILY's List, will serve as Obama's communications director. Moran worked for the AFL-CIO, coordinating "Wal-Mart corporate accountability activities," before returning to EMILY's, an organization dedicated to helping Democratic women get elected to office. It had endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton for president.  See who's on Obama's short list for cabinet posts » Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago, Illinois, to work as communications director. Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team. "These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people," Obama said in a written statement. "This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history." On Friday, sources indicated that some of Obama's Cabinet posts were close to being filled. Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is "on track" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper discuss Obama's choices » Transition officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Obama planned to announce Geithner's appointment on Monday, along with that of Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council. Summers is a former president of Harvard University and served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. Two sources said Friday that Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a serious contender for commerce secretary but that he could be chosen for another senior post.	1
For Hillary Clinton 2016, Warren Buffett is putting his money where is mouth is and making his first-ever donation to an independent political group. Buffett, the world's third-richest man and head of Berkshire Hathaway, gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, according to a source with the group. The donation, which will appear on the group's next disclosure form, is the max one donor can give under Ready for Hillary's self-imposed cap. The donation was first reported by Bloomberg Politics. Buffett has long disagreed with super PACs and in 2012 he stayed away from donating to them. Buffett has been bullish on Clinton for years. "Hillary is going to win, yeah," Buffett, an outspoken Clinton supporter, said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October. "I will bet money on it. And I don't do that easily." He also told CNN in 2012 that Clinton was the most qualified candidate for 2016. "I don't see how you could have anybody better qualified," Buffett told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview. "I like what she believes in. ... I think she's extraordinarily able and energetic for that matter in pushing those beliefs."	1
As rescue efforts continue Tuesday, Colombia's president will visit the mountainside neighborhood where a massive landslide buried dozens of homes. By Monday night, search crews had uncovered 23 dead bodies there, the Red Cross said, and more than 120 people could still be trapped underground. "We are still hoping to find people alive," Red Cross National Deputy Director Jorge Ivan Nova said Monday. But he said survival becomes less likely as time passes. Rescuers had pulled at least seven injured people from the rubble after Sunday's landslide in Bello, Colombia, which buried between 30 and 50 homes, Nova said. Officials believe the neighborhood was particularly packed Sunday afternoon -- a time when families commonly get together for meals, he said. "I hope they can be rescued. You could hear screams below the homes. I ask that they not stop the search. Thank God I could save my son and my husband also is alive. But I lost many loved ones," resident Maria Garcia told CNN affiliate Caracol TV. More than 700 people were working in shifts on search teams at the site Monday, Caracol reported. Amid the chaos of the rescue effort, a young boy tugged firefighter Carlos Garcia's belt. "He asked me, 'firefighter, where are we going to sleep tonight?' And what most impacted me was seeing his little face. I also have a 6-year-old boy," Garcia told Caracol. About 150 people from the neighborhood were in nearby shelters, Caracol reported, and government officials said they were evacuating other neighborhoods in the area. "The zone, geologically, is very unstable," Diego Munoz, Bello's government secretary, told Caracol. At least 194 people have been killed and 248 injured after torrential rains throughout Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry. The downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers, destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide, the ministry said. Colombia is considering declaring a state of emergency to devote more resources to response and rescue efforts, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Sunday, describing the rains and flooding as "a tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country." The president said he plans to travel Tuesday to Bello -- a suburb of Medellin, Colombia.	1

Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona, once dubbed "America's Sheriff," turned himself in Tuesday to a Colorado federal prison to begin serving his 5 1/2-year sentence for a witness tampering conviction. Carona, 55, will serve 66 months in a minimum-security facility called "The Camp" at the Englewood federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, said John Sell, a corrections spokesman. The prison is 15 miles southwest of Denver. Carona will have to serve at least 85% of his sentence, spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Central District of California told CNN. Carona was sentenced in April 2009 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. He was convicted of trying to persuade a former assistant to lie to and withhold testimony from a federal grand jury investigating claims of corruption in Carona's campaign and his administration, according to a statement by Mrozek. Carona was also ordered to pay a fine of $125,000, according to Mrozek. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of a wide-ranging corruption scheme in which Carona used illegal campaign contributions and personally accepted cash bribes, Mrozek's statement said. According to the U.S. attorney's office's press release, U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford sentenced Carona and called witness tampering "a very serious offense." The judge added that "lying will not be tolerated in this courtroom, especially by law enforcement, especially by the highest-ranking law enforcement official in the county," according to the prosecutors' statement. During the trial, prosecutors said they presented evidence of a secretly recorded meeting in August 2007 in which Carona tried to persuade former Assistant Sheriff Don Haidl to lie to a grand jury that Carona thought had subpoenaed Haidl, according to Mrozek. In papers filed with the court before the 2009 sentencing, prosecutors charged that Carona received or solicited cash and other items of value worth at least $432,144, according to Mrozek's statement. The FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation into Carona.	1
It's almost impossible for a photographer to find fresh visual perspectives these days. Brooklyn-based Zack Seckler had to travel to a different continent and strap into an ultra-light aircraft to find one. His Botswana series presents the country from between 50 and 500 feet, providing a unique and captivating view of the savannah. "Within the first few minutes of being up there, I was just completely blown away," he says. "Being in that airspace, you're really seeing the world from a perspective that only birds see. Obviously no human on the ground can see that, and the big jumbo jets up above don't fly that low. So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual." Read more: How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love Botswana, in southern Africa, is a little smaller than Texas and hosts large concentrations of animals ranging from wildebeest to zebras to flamingos. Most of it is covered by the Kalahari, a vast stretch of forbidding sandy savannah. It's also the site of the Makgadikgadi Pans, one of the world's largest salt flats and a surreal landscape coated in turquoise algae. The pans and its surrounding marshes and wetlands (known for their baobab trees), as well as the Okavango Delta, became Seckler's visual sandbox as he soared between photo opportunities. The project started in 2009 when Seckler visited Botswana for another assignment and had some downtime. He asked his client to suggest activities to fill his final free days. Seckler was soon introduced to a pilot, who took him on his first ultra-light flight over the salt flats. "It's just me and the pilot sitting right next to each other, knees practically touching," he says. "There are no real doors, no windows—there's only a windshield, propeller, and wings." Seckler was hooked, and returned to do three more shoots from an ultra-light and a small Cessna.	1
During the Khmer Rouge regime, I was put in prison at the age of 15 for picking mushrooms in the rice fields to feed my pregnant sister. Under the Khmer Rouge, everything belonged to the Revolution — and picking up anything from urns to books was considered a political act.“If you love your sister, you will do everything in your power to protect and provide for her.”It was a cruel regime, but the rule of law was one of the few structures that worked. People, not leaders, are in control of the law.I met President Donald Trump just hours after his inauguration while I was in Cambodia. I saw the same people who looked down on the political class in the United States watching from behind bars. I saw a man who was ready to take responsibility for his actions and for the law. I witnessed the strength of Cambodian people to show their people what he could do and the hope and promise of America.My Cambodian friends were in tears as they watched him swear in. They couldn’t believe it. They were excited, though, at the same time. At that moment, the United States had their attention. I had my attention.On Monday, in a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Trump promised, “As I have indicated, we do not want conflict with any country. We do not want conflict with any people. We do not want conflict at all. We want to love and cherish our enemies and do everything possible for them.”The American president spoke these words to the Israeli public, but the American people are watching from the shadows of the US capital. The American people are watching from the distance where our people are watching from the prison walls. They have already made up their minds. America is no longer a nation of immigrants. It is a nation of people who have been ripped apart from their countries. This was the promise of the Trump administration — to create a more welcoming immigration policy.In the case of Israel, Americans had to be convinced. Trump wanted to create a nation where it would be more difficult and more painful for an immigrant to come here and settle in. He said he wanted to “build a land of peace,” and he wanted to “stop the endless wars” in that land. He promised to “build a great wall,” and	0
When I won the reality show competition "Survivor: Africa" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer. But that's the way my life has unfolded. One day I was  just a "normal" girl living a life of privilege in an ivory tower; next, I was suddenly facing chemotherapy, surgeries, and a whole new set of problems — including the side effects that would eventually save my life.It was in 1994, when I was barely 22 years old, that I got the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, the leading cause of female cancer death in the United States. I was in the process of being med school when my doctor told me, "This is pretty bad. We need to do some chemotherapy." After a few months of radiation, I made the decision to go into remission — and that's the year I found out I had ovarian cancer.At the time I thought I was lucky. I thought I was so lucky that my doctors had told me I wouldn't die this year, and I was so lucky that after a year I felt the cancer had gone down. After my initial diagnosis — there are a lot of women with ovarian cancer I've never met — I told my family I was going to quit my job and do something with my life. I hadn't yet told the doctors I was dying. They asked if I was going to have a hysterectomy to remove the tumor — a surgical procedure commonly known as "the procedure." But I wanted to find out the truth about what was going on inside me — and by "truth" I mean information I never wanted anyone to learn about. So, I decided to do what the doctors said, with some help from my family, who were really quite supportive.When I was diagnosed, I had a hysterectomy and a couple of rounds of radiation, which the doctors said would take care of any residual cancer I might have had. The hysterectomy was scheduled for August 8, just two days before I was supposed to fly home on vacation. But my doctors wouldn't let me fly home that day. They said that if I was going to have the procedure the next day, I'd have to travel to my hometown so they could perform the surgery. I found solace in the fact that my family had decided I shouldn't fly home that day and that I wouldn't have	0
A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau's brain for clues to the NFL veteran's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture, his family said Monday. Seau, 43, died of a gunshot wound at his Oceanside, California, home wound last week in what the coroner concluded was a suicide. There has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20-year pro football career could have been a contributing factor. Seau's parents, who are from the island of Aunu'u, American Samoa, were meeting Monday with Samoan elders, according to Shawn Mitchell, who was Seau's pastor. "The Seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders," a family statement said. "All possibilities are being considered, but none will be acted upon until the Seaus arrive at an agreed upon direction." While there was no evidence Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions, friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career. Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week. While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits. Duerson committed suicide, shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage. While Seau left no such note, he did aim the handgun at his chest. "Him taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined," Mitchell said. As a linebacker, Seau played "the most havoc-ridden position on the team. He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role," said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons.	1
Sporting an all-black racing suit, Bubacarr Jallow kneels next to his bright red motorcycle to check its oil levels and make sure the nuts and bolts are tightened properly. Satisfied, he hops on his Yamaha AG100 and hits the bumpy dirt road, weaving his way through rugged tracks and treacherous terrain. Being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess, but for Jallow these skills are crucial. As a community health nurse, he relies on his two-wheeled companion to reach the isolated villages dotting the Combo Central region in The Gambia, West Africa. In an area where lack of roads and unreliable transport would typically force patients to spend several hours reaching the nearest clinic on foot or by bicycle, Jallow's durable bike allows him to navigate through the bush to deliver life-saving treatment and health advice to rural communities. Armed with a medical kit, his routine motorbike round includes visits to at-risk pregnant women and malnourished children. He checks them for any warning signs and, if needed, refers them to the nearest health center. He also distributes mosquito bed nets and food supplements and educates locals about life-threatening diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need. The UK-based group says it manages a fleet of more than 1,400 motorcycles, ambulances and other trekking vehicles in seven African countries, reaching about 12 million people. It trains African health workers to drive safely on difficult terrain and teaches them how to carry out simple maintenance checks on their vehicles on a daily basis. In addition, it ensures that there is a reliable supply chain of spare parts, while a network of local RFH-employed technicians services all bikes and cars monthly to make sure they don't break down. "I received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and I have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers," says Jallow, whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages.	1
The gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous. My job is to ask tough questions, but when it comes to faith, God, and religion, the more questions I ask in my quest for truth and understanding, the more complex the  answers become.For example, I find solace in my friendship with the late Frank Viola, an amazing person who shared many of his faith convictions in his lifetime. Yet I still have trouble asking him difficult questions about his faith. I often get the sense that he would love to give me an honest and open response, but he simply cannot find the words. After several days of this struggle and uncertainty, I asked him if he was okay. After all, Frank had always treated me with the highest regards in our time together. In other words, he had never in the past expressed a disagreement with me. I was concerned because he was not responding to texts that I sent over the duration of our relationship. In some ways, his feelings of insecurity over my questions were not surprising, but Frank had never before spoken about these struggles as a result of my questioning him.Frank and I talked for hours yesterday about these difficult questions. He shared:I do not want to discuss this with you because it is a matter of personal conscience – and I have an abiding trust in God to answer my questions and provide the answers to my questions. I do not want to be accused of being insincere. But I am saying this now because there are so many people who are interested in knowing more about God – and I do not want to be responsible for the public discourse about this in any manner. I do have questions, but I would not know how to answer them honestly and openly at this moment – and for the very reason that I am a man, a pastor, and a husband, I fear the consequences of answering them. So I will not answer.You are not interested in my ideas on these matters, but you do want to know about my faith – and so I welcome your questions. You are asking me about my faith because you are a Christian and because you have an interest in Christ, but this is a private conversation.I am not a Christian, but I believe in Christ. I am the pastor of a congregation of believers – although I am not the bishop of this group, but they are my spiritual heirs.I am human – but I	0
A Canadian teenage girl has been found guilty of distributing child pornography in connection with "sexting" pictures of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, the youth crown prosecutor for Victoria said Friday. The British Columbia case of the then 16-year-old, who is not identified because she is a minor, is believed to be one of the first cases in Canada where a teenager has been convicted of child pornography charges related to "sexting." The teenager, who also was convicted of uttering threats, is out on bail while awaiting sentencing, Crown Prosecutor Chandra Fisher said. She declined to speculate on what sentence the teen might face. Calling the case "precedent-setting," Fisher said the case should serve as a warning to teens about what they text and post online. The case began in November 2012 when the teen learned that her 17-year-old boyfriend was still in contact with his former girlfriend. "The accused was not at all happy that he was still in touch with his ex," Fisher told CNN. The teenager initially threatened the ex-girlfriend on Facebook, the prosecutor said. She then texted five explicit pictures of the ex-girlfriend that she found on her boyfriend's phone to a group of people, Fisher said. The teen's attorney, Christopher Mackie, said the charges were inappropriate. "Our sights have always been set on the constitutional question. ...She never denied that she did this," he told CNN. "Online bullying, yes. Child pornography, no." When bullying goes high-tech 10% of tweens, teens have 'sexted'	1
It took a lot of effort for Leo Bonten to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp. For starters, he had to break the damn thing in a freak kiddie pool accident. As one does. Seriously. Â But it was worth it in the end.First, he had to get the cast off. He sat there for a little while, trying to figure out how to disentangle it from his leg. By the time he took a step back, the cast was off and everything was intact.Then he had to get that stump to stand on its own. He started by laying down on the cement with his legs spread out. It was a little awkward at first, but after a few failed attempts Leo was able to stand on the cast and make his way to the water's edge. He waded in the pool, keeping hold of his cast until he was out of the water. Then he sat down again and waited for the cast to dry out.You know, as much as you think you can fix whatever you end up with, it often gets worse. You don't realize it until a year later when it's just about unusable.One of the first steps that Leo had to take with his hand was getting the bone to come back into shape. He spent hours rubbing it with ice and massage cream. He'd also use hot baths to help his hand recover, and he tried to keep his leg off the ground to help the circulation.Finally, he started trying to use the limb. His first attempts were pathetic. Using a baseball glove with the stump extended between the fingertips, Leo put on his dad's cast and walked. He tried a short climb, but after a few steps his leg would give way and he couldn't get it back up. So he took the baseball glove and put it on his other hand. The difference was dramatic. On his left hand he could run and crawl. His right hand would be useless for anything but typing.Then he got a better idea. With the glove on his left hand, he went back to the pool and waded in. He slowly moved around, trying to get the arm back into shape. Sometimes he used his other hand to help guide him. Once he got his stump where he wanted it, he started practicing.As Leo spent more time in the pool, he started to feel his stump.	0
January 31, 2014 This Friday, CNN Student News is all about journeys: the nationwide one that millions of Chinese are taking for the Lunar New Year, the harrowing one that led thousands of Atlantans to abandon their cars, and the vernal one that began with the first snowfalls of the season. Our team on the ground, in the air, and in cyberspace is keeping our eyes trained on these moments as we continue this countdown to Valentine's Day.A group of students at Stanford University recently got a glimpse of what it feels like to be homeless on the eve of Christmas: a group of Stanford students who have created a makeshift homeless shelter in Palo Alto, California. The new shelter's aim is to help students who find themselves without a place to stay on campus during the holidays. Their new shelter is the first of its kind designed for students "without a place to stay at Christmas," the Daily said in a story on Thursday.It's a good thing that we have the benefit of this first experience as a homeless-shelter-creating-student tool to learn from. But, like these homeless kids, we could use a few more experiences like this to start making improvements to an idea we already know works — whether it's "doubling up" or our system of providing housing vouchers for middle- and low-income students.I don't mean to diminish the efforts of these students who put themselves at risk by sleeping out in freezing temperatures, but I do have to admit that I don't think they were the first people to figure out the idea of doubling up.The concept in question is called "home away from home" — where students live in a shelter when they visit campus, but then return to their homes, or home away from home, when they are not on campus.These are not the first students to use a similar strategy at a university. A team of University of Notre Dame students found that "students who live in dorms get very attached to the campus and community they belong to on a day-to-day basis," The Wall Street Journal reported.These students who lived in the dorms of Notre Dame lived a lot of the "normal" parts of college life. There was a full restaurant meal on campus, often with the students sharing a room or two. There was an evening basketball game, or football or hockey game. There was pizza, or maybe	0
The Pakistan Taliban said Wednesday it will not extend a cease-fire with the Pakistani government, six days after a weeks-long pause in hostilities officially ended. In a statement released to the news media, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, alleged the Pakistani government hadn't responded positively to the cease-fire, which began as a monthlong observance on March 1 and eventually was extended to April 10. One of the militant group's leaders, Umer Khalid Khurrsani, said Wednesday that the government wasn't serious about peace and that the only way to implement Sharia, Islamic law, was jihad. The group made a series of demands this month, including the release of detained noncombatants. Pakistan's government has not yet issued a response to the announcement, Interior Ministry spokesman Danial Gillani said Wednesday. The TTP has waged an insurgency against the Pakistani government, fighting for its austere version of Sharia across Pakistan and rejecting the country's constitution. Pakistan announced a peace initiative, and a cease-fire was reached to pave the way for talks, but discussions broke down in March after Taliban attacks. Pakistani government representatives did meet the Taliban for talks on March 26, the first direct contact between the two sides. The Taliban had made demands, including the release of noncombatants, in early April. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier as a good will gesture to promote peace talks, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The release came at the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Khan said. Since taking office last year, Sharif faced mounting pressure to bring the violence under control.	1
Perhaps your history teachers failed to alert you to these Civil War facts: Jefferson Davis nearly got mugged by an angry female mob; Abraham Lincoln loved the Confederate anthem "Dixie," and Paul Revere was a Civil War casualty. "Dixie" was was a huge hit across the country and quickly became one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite tunes. The Civil War, in addition to being among the defining moments of U.S. history, is also the source of some bizarre and surprisingly cool trivia. 1. Lincoln's first solution to slavery was a fiasco Early in his presidency, Abe was convinced that white Americans would never accept black Americans. "You and we are different races," the president told a committee of "colored" leaders in August 1862. "...But for your race among us there could not be war...It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated." Lincoln proposed voluntary emigration to Central America, seeing it as a more convenient destination than Liberia. This idea didn't sit well with leaders like Frederick Douglass, who considered colonization to be "a safety valve...for white racism." Luckily for Douglass (and the country), colonization failed spectacularly. One of the first attempts was on Île à Vache, a.k.a. Cow Island, a small isle off the coast of Haiti. The island was owned by land developer Bernard Kock, who claimed he had approved a black American colony with the Haitian government. No one bothered to call him on that claim. Following a smallpox outbreak on the boat ride down, hundreds of black colonizers were abandoned on the island with no housing prepared for them, as Kock had promised. To make matters worse, the soil on Cow Island was too poor for any serious agriculture. In January 1864, the Navy rescued the survivors from the ripoff colony. Once Île à Vache fell through, Lincoln never spoke of colonization again.Mental Floss: 6 Historical Events People Love to Reenact 2. Hungry ladies effectively mugged Jefferson Davis The Confederacy's image hinged on the notion that the rebellious states made up a unified, stable nation. However, the hard times of war exposed just how much disunity there was in Dixieland.	1
American Airlines has found cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767-300 aircraft, according to the airline and to the planes' manufacturer. Concerned airlines are being contacted by passengers whose comfortable flights have turned into uncomfortable ones. The cracks, discovered earlier this year on some of the world's biggest aircraft, are about eight inches (20 centimeters) in diameter. They may cause the engines to seize or cause them to shut down. There have been no reports that the engines have seized. Airline service has been suspended for the time being. Passengers have been offered a full refund, if they want to cancel their flights - the airline's policy is to offer 30 days' pay. In a letter sent to passengers on Wednesday, an Air Canada spokeswoman told them: "If you have been affected by this, we would like to help you through this difficult period. "However, we want our customers to understand that due to safety reasons we will not be running our flights for the time being. We will be conducting further inspections of the pylons, and we will let everyone know as soon as we can." But how do you know something is wrong with a big aircraft before you see something that is actually wrong with it? The American Airlines pylon in question was found a year and a half ago by the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, on a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. It is now on the verge of collapsing, but has not yet, because it is being repaired. The pylon was designed to support more than 500,000 pounds (230,000 kilograms) - but the weight was designed for a 767-300. According to aviation experts the cracks in the pylon were caused by an out-of-balance condition, caused in the plane's manufacture more than 20 years ago. "It has happened before," said David Gaughan, head of the defence department's transportation safety board, in Ottawa on Wednesday. The cracks are not likely to affect the pylons' strength or design. They are much too small for that. Air Canada has been in contact with other airlines, and will be trying to make an announcement on the airline's website. All other major airlines are still flying, but passengers have become increasingly apprehensive about the possibility of accidents	0
Comedian Joan Rivers is "resting comfortably" in a New York hospital after apparently suffering cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure at a medical clinic Thursday. Her daughter, Melissa Rivers, issued a weet that described her mother as "out of surgery."Rivers' publicist, Jeff Burstein, declined to respond to reports that Rivers's daughter was with her. But in a series of tweets yesterday, Melissa Rivers said "Mama's resting comfortably in ICU" and joked that her father had lost a bet that he'd be the first male to die after an operation.Rivers is in her 60s and had been hospitalized on August 6, 2012, after suffering a stroke. She underwent brain surgery to remove a blood clot that had been discovered during a routine physical, and she told People that she had also undergone a bronchoscopy to help with breathing. At one point in the recovery process, she seemed to have no movement on her left side, leaving hospital staff to believe she was having a heart attack.In a statement to People, Rivers' doctor described her as "alert, stable and in good spirits," and said she was "doing great" at North Shore University Hospital.An examination by specialists at the hospital found Rivers "had no signs of a stroke" that made her unable to open her left eye.The actress' "out of surgery" Twitter account is an apparent reference to the story from 2006 of comedian Larry David, who was in a coma following a heart attack, when the character Ron Swanson declared over a loudspeaker that he was resting "comfortably" in a hospital room with his wife.Rivers' daughter Melissa Rivers, a comedy writer, tweeted yesterday, "Mama's resting comfortably in ICU. She was amazing (in her recovery and with her illness) through the most difficult time."If she's really resting comfortably, she'll be making some very happy faces. Of course, we hope she's not resting comfortably—it would be a sad story if she died after suffering a heart attack. We'd like to thank the doctors and nurses who are there to help her recover, but also to remind her that her recovery is a long one.Saying you're "resting comfortably" is not the same as being "out of surgery" and not even "in the operating room." There are things you can do to help her recovery,	0

But when the cause was traced back to the same mystery auto club where Jessica Chambers had competed in her auto class, the accident was nothing more than a lead for the police.When his death was initially ruled an accident, the young man's family knew they should talk to someone who knew him.

Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history. The forced retirements,  by Humala, come despite the approval, last month, of a law that would require the defense minister and other ministers of defense to stand down in the event of a coup against him.The move followed a report by the international commission of human rights and public freedoms, which condemned the police for poor morale, poor training, and for the excessive use of torture. The move to cut the size of the national police force of 33,000 has provoked outrage in some countries, including Argentina and Bolivia.In a statement on Thursday, Humala said he believed that the "solution to crime and violence lies in the transformation of society, including with education and development programs for the social and economic improvement of the country." Humala said the police's morale remained high, and that they had gained new weapons from the United States. He added that those dismissed were guilty of "fraud or misconduct."U.S. President George W. Bush spoke with Humala earlier on Thursday, asking him to reconsider the move, though Humala said he would not resign. Humala also said he would be ready to accept political responsibility for the officers' forced retirement. Humala has promised a new police force that would be more professional and less corrupt.President Bush has asked Humala to release the officers on the condition that they stay out of politics.AAP/Pablo SanhuezaHumala's announcement of the retraction of the police officers' forced retirement came hours before the UN Human Rights Council adopted a new draft resolution calling for an end to discrimination in the armed forces. Humala said the new resolution, which the council's human rights committee adopted on Thursday, did not address the issue of forced retirement.The U.S. president also spoke of the need for a "free and open, fair and transparent" election on July 1 to replace him, and said he planned to hold a debate on the status of the army at the UN that day.It remains unclear what force will be put in place to replace the nearly 30,000 officers who will be laid off. The president of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, said the president would discuss the situation with the army chief of staff Thursday afternoon, and that the army would then make	0
It is about to get a bit more difficult to illegally download TV shows, movies or music online. A new alert system, rolling out over the next two months, will repeatedly warn and possibly punish people violating digital copyrights. The Copyright Alert System was announced last July and has been four years in the making. If you use AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner, or Verizon as your Internet service provider, you could receive the first of one of these notes starting in the next two months. The Internet provider is delivering the message, but the legwork is being done by the copyright owners, which will monitor peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent. They use a service called MarkMonitor, which uses a combination of people and automated systems to spot illegal downloading. It will collect the IP addresses of offenders, but no personal information. The IP addresses are turned over to the Internet providers, which will match up the address with the right customer and send the notification. The warning system is described as a graduated response. First the Internet provider will let the customer know that their Internet connection is being used to download content illegally. The note will include information to steer them away from their life of crime, including tips on how they can download content legally. There will also be tips on securing Internet connections, just in case you were unaware that your neighbor was downloading season three of "Dexter" using your unprotected wireless network. "The progressive series of alerts is designed to make consumers aware of activity that has occurred using their Internet accounts, educate them on how they can prevent such activity from happening again," the CCI said in its announcement today. After the educational phase, the customers will be asked to acknowledge that they received the warning. If they continue to download content illegally, the alerts will threaten mild punishments, such as forcing the copyright violator to read "educational materials," or throttling their Internet connection so that it is slow, making it harder to download large files. Today's announcement claims that terminating the Internet service is not one of the options. If a customer feels they are being wrongly accused, they can ask for a review, which will cost them $35 according to the Verge. The entire system will be overseen by an organization called the Center for Copyright Information, which includes content owners, such as the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America, as well as individual members including Disney, Sony Pictures, Fox, EMI and Universal.	1
